8/ also, make some provision for those who want the prize, and others who are simply after HV19-* only (standardise the flag format pls!!)
7/ this idea is inspired by my software engineering course back in uni, to illustrate adapting to changes in user requirements, a lab i enjoyed, not dry like "design patterns" :ugh: and also me ditching the whole crappy unstable vm and tunnel, and rewriting it all myself
6/ this should up the "fun" element - from auditing and fixing vuln code this year, to now writing safe code from scratch, with the pressure of time
5/ offer the flag after a series of N correct responses to a service
4/ so players will query the service endpoint, and host their service, according to the same spec (a spec was somewhat lacking this year)
3/ just when they think they've got it all sorted, then sometime into the game, announce changes in spec, so the longer you take to implement, the more points you lose
2/ instead of releasing source code, release a seemingly simple spec for starters, for players to check that they've got things setup properly to play,
