That #AvengersInfinityWar trailer was pretty cool! I'm hoping they can get this right.
@greg_1_anderson @AshdayInteract That's the first I've seen that one. Looks interesting! I've been using betterSnapTool from the app store for a similar reason. I like my vertical screen to have the bottom 2/3 a snap area for my idea and such with the remaining third on top be for other things.

@VZWSupport My wife's Galaxy S7 had the same issue. Let's move this to a DM before I give out zip codes
@VZWSupport I just did a power cycle and that had three automatic timezone detection work correctly. So will I have to remember to restart my phone every dst? We don't do daylight savings in AZ so that is pretty annoying
@VZWSupport Sure, I'll play. All location services are on and were prior to today.
@VZWSupport Yeah I corrected it manually. This is something that happens every couple of years. I've had Verizon for a long time and dst is something I have to override on every device.
@VZWSupport It doesn't seem to matter between cellular and wifi, but I was on cellular at the time. I have a Moto Z Play Droid. If I let the network decide my timezone it is always mountain daylight which is incorrect
Stupid dst. My phone constantly thinks it is in mountain time despite being in AZ. @verizon shouldn't your network know better? I can override it but I shouldn't have to
