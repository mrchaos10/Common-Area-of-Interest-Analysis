Incredible how nobody wants to talk about Sarri and how he’s managing one of the best midfielders in the world in Kante. 

Consistently playing him out of position and we exposed him yesterday. He doesn’t trust Kante in the middle for some reason.

At the end of the day, Özils one of the best players in his position in the world. Delighted we kept him, that Özil new contract and Aubameyang signing was a big sign of ambition by us.
If it was up to me, Wilshere and Ramsey would still be at the club. We need a big club mentality. You don’t see Juventus going oh we want Ronaldo so let’s get rid of Dybala so we can afford him. 

Or Bayern Munich, try to buy one of their stars and see how you get on. Big clubs.
This was at a time when we were losing Sanchez and virtually everyone thought Özil was off with him to Utd aswell. But no we kept a superstar at our club and people are still complaining. Madness
People love to talk about Özils wages on his new contract. Absolute idiots all of them. Getting Özil that new deal was a big club move and a lot of you fans have a small club mentality.

Honestly believe we’ll lose to Liverpool this weekend. They’re the best team in England rn and my favs to win the title which is why we needed to win today.
Arsenal’s best player is Mesut Özil and we need to build the team around him. If the manager can’t see that then he’ll lose the fans simple as that.

I don’t care what anyone says but Wenger is never taking off Özil at half time expecially when the game is 1-1. 
Emery has essentially just thrown away 3 points today.
