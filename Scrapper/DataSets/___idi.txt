@LA_Rosewood @Donpeezly I further proved my point that in the English language you don't need to specify some or all for understanding
@Queen_Miso @LA_Rosewood It's like he's purposely not trying to understand. And it is a specific group "people of Africa/Africans"
@LA_Rosewood @Donpeezly Well my message doesn't change based on the readers interpretation.  And you did because you said false. That's a invalidating my statement. "Americans eat burgers" some are vegan that don't mean Americans don't eat burgers. It's very simple
@___nire_ I'm not changing my language cuz people don't have common sense
@Donpeezly Cuz it's basic understanding that you don't mean all by saying that group.
RT @Jvmessays: Stop using semantics to be annoying y'all know what people mean... https://t.co/SvwRBbReTW
@Donpeezly @LA_Rosewood Not at all. The people I'm speaking about are black men. I didn't say all black men.
I don't understand why people never understand that. https://t.co/Sdm3DOVoRI
@PrinceT_O The message doesn't get to be changed based on the readers interpretation.
@Donpeezly @LA_Rosewood I can dig up tweets from when she came for black women and black men were gassing her saying she look good and her ass fat. In the same space. Just because it not y'all don't mean it's not truth to my statement.
If I say people in Africa are struggling. Does that mean every person in Africa is struggling? Or does that mean people who live in Africa
@LA_Rosewood This is not how the English language works.
@LA_Rosewood Not false because you as a person didn't. That's not how this works.

@Nooooooope_ I don't. But any opinions I tweet are mine and I shouldn't have to say imo as a disclaimer
@Nooooooope_ She didn't try to offend anyone that's why it's wrong to make crack jokes. And that's why it don't correlate
I remember that day on Twitter VERY well because she was saying black women hate her cuz black men love her. Yall ain't have that energy for her https://t.co/In0VqCqA5o
@Nooooooope_ And I said that last part. Don't make the jokes. Especially if you gonna be mad at who laughs. Demi wasn't on the same time at all. Thats why I feel it don't correlate
@Nooooooope_ Its not a narrative. It's the facts. Couple years ago she was like black girls hate me cuz black men want me and the black men were on here like well her ass fat tho. So make the two different points cuz black men made her comfortable. Period.
RT @EyelessSilas: People are always gonna @ them for clout and RTs https://t.co/Rs1g8H7kYX
@Nooooooope_ Demi was laughing at memes on Twitter. People violated. If it's not funny then why the jokes if only some people can laugh? 
Also nahjulz is downright disrespectful. Who was there recording w her when she rapped that. Not a black man. He laughed right
Black men definitely who put the battery in NahJulia back. 
Demi ain't even have her energy so I'm not sure how that correlates.
