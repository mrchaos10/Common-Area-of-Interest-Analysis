@Humanelk If you're not sure you want to make that commitment, I would start with the excellent one-volume abridge Journal edited by Damion Searls and published by @nyrbclassics. https://t.co/4oV7ly4VaR
@Humanelk If you're a stickler for accuracy, you could get hold of the 8 volumes of the Princeton edition -- but it will cost you. They also don't cover the whole Journal, so you'd need to complete your journey with the last 8 volumes of 1906. (That's what I'm doing.)
@Humanelk The 1906 edition (still the only complete one) was also reprinted in 14 paperback volumes by Gibbs Smith in 1984. The small volumes are easier to carry around, but the set will run you $300 and up used.
@Humanelk The most affordable way to read the whole Journal is get the massive 2-volume Dover edition of 1962, which will run about $50 a volume used. It reproduces the 1906 edition by putting four of the original pages on one big page.
