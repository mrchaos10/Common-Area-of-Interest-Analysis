(Also learned this from Queer Eye‚Äôs Karamo; that often times we do help others but we forget what our intentions are for helping them. Is it for ourselves? Our ego? Or for the betterment of everyone?)
And more than anything else, fight for the lives of others. Maraming mali sa sistema natin ngayon, maraming nagsusuffer dahil rito. Masarap maging fulfilled sa sarili pero mas masarap ang buhay kung lahat ng tao ay fulfilled.
I hope that anyone who is going through a transition or is in a difficult situation would keep fighting for a better life they deserve. Maikli lang ang buhay, make it worth your while.
She also keeps close contact with her parents and siblings! Aahhh the positivity she radiates is inspiring. She keeps her Instagram account as a gratitude gram for everything she is thankful for and aaahhh ang galing lang how she was able to reinvent her life and make it her own.

Sofaking annoying. Hirap makipagtalo sa bahay rin about this. This aint just about Ellen, this is about women.
Mga gago, she has the right to do whatever she likes under her consent. Jusko, her sexual lifestyle does not define her as a person.
People stereotyping her as a slut who hooked JL. Uhm, sino ba si John Lloyd? Diyos ba siya? Who are men to have to validate women as people?
No biases or anything but I hate it when people slut shame Ellen Adarna; most especially when she got together with John Lloyd. Wtf kayo
