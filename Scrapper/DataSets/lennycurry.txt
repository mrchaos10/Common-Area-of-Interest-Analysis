@AaronRodgers12 is why you stay up for the 4th Q on Sunday night when the score is 20-3.  Then 20-10.  Love the game even when it‚Äôs not your team.
2.  And this is all about them.  That‚Äôs why guys like Malik do this without fanfare.  These guys run into burning buildings, run into gunfire, provide medical service to folks in crisis on any given day.  They Answer when duty calls.  @jaff122 #gratitude
