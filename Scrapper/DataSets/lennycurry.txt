Great game. Saw a Bears big guy hug Parkey right after the miss. Love so many layers of this sport and this game was loaded with those layers.
That’s 2.  IMO.
This is why I love this sport.

4.  “Even though they all had good intentions and even though they were all willing to put money up for it, it doesn’t substitute for getting the job done by getting good support,” Cockroft said #JaxOnTheRise.
3. “If we needed an answer, they would go above and beyond to get those answers.”
That wasn’t the case elsewhere. “We sensed that we couldn’t get that level of support from any other city that we talked to,” he said.
2. Access for assistance also helped, especially given that Shanghai is 13 hours ahead of Jacksonville. For example, 3 p.m. in Shanghai is 2 a.m. in Jacksonville. “Anytime there was an issue, we could just call them on our cellphones in the middle of the night,” Cockroft said.

I’ve read a handful of books on Mother Teresa. She said this &amp; it has had a lasting impact on me.  “If you can’t feed a hundred people, then feed just one.”  This shaped me in ways that have pushed and challenged me to friend 1 person and meet 1 need at a time.  #EurekaGardens
@AGGancarski So post.  We are all in this struggle together.
@AGGancarski All folks have unseen personal/family challenges. Posts, from my perspective, are a celebration that we are together with all our imperfections.  Sometimes all of us.  Sometimes some of us.  Sometimes smiles.  Sometimes struggles. Nothing worth having or accomplishing is easy.

Watching the calls tonight &amp; the calls of the last few weeks I see a new rule coming. It will prohibit contact on the QB.  Give them 3 seconds to throw the Ball. No throw? It’s a sack. If they scramble and run they get an average run distance of all QB scrambles for last 5 years
This represents all that I believe must be done to accomplish our goals.  He scored on this play if your not tuned in or not a ball fan. https://t.co/kqemXuw0A7

3. I will not tolerate disparagement or disrespect of the men and women who serve or served. On behalf of the City of Jacksonville I apologize to veterans and service members who are rightly troubled by the events that have been reported. https://t.co/cXle3Arm4Q
2. What I saw reported is 100 percent inconsistent with how I expect every city employee to interact with our citizens. I have ordered a review of the actions of the employee and pending the completion of that review, the employee and her supervisor have been placed on leave
1. Employees of the City of Jacksonville are the servants of taxpayers who have a duty to enforce our laws and regulations. I expect every one of them to do that job in a manner that is respectful and reflects the privilege we all have to serve this great city. https://t.co/yixIsRJxCa
2.  We support our military and veterans, and we appreciate businesses who honor their service.
1.  I Have directed city staff that military flags should be treated same as US flag. Let them fly. I Have reached out to the business owner &amp; will review employee procedures. COJ employees r expected to be respectful of our customers - you, the people of Jacksonville.

4. We have to find a way to make them recognize there is so much more for them than they can imagine, if they choose to believe in hope and peace.
3  And follow dreams. In the shadow of all that opportunity and assistance, a 7 yr old had life stolen by someone so hopeless and directionless that they didn't hesitate to recklessly turn our streets into a war zone.We have to break through to these young people.
2 This happened Less than 2 miles from City Hall, Within 2 miles of our government and churches and schools and FSCJ and fire houses and sheriff substations, all institutions designed to help keep a community safe and allow kids the security to grow and learn how to make choices
1. Last night a 7 yr old was killed in a drive by shooting in our city. We must come together as a community and stop this senseless violence to give our kids a sense of hope and peace.

2.  Speeches are nice.  Professional opinion makers are nice, etc.  But the real stuff, that is actionable,comes from listening to &amp; understanding people living their lives in our city.
The best policy &amp; action is driven by listening to people in their neighborhoods,on front porches, in their yards. This is the most powerful &amp; rewarding way to do my job.  It’s real.
