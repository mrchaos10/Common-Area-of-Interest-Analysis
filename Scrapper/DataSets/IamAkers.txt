@LeighDublya @GarethSimms true, he ain't his older bro!
@LeighDublya would you trade Brady for Eli on current form? I wanted Jay Cuttler but @GarethSimms got there before me!
@LeighDublya @sakerman29 @oWestyo @GarethSimms no preference
@GarethSimms @LeighDublya my teams are mainly based on names I know and what they did last year. Projections have been way off so far!
@LeighDublya I had a quick look this afternoon. I changed some shit! you are still the big favourite to win mind!
@LeighDublya @oWestyo @GarethSimms @sakerman29 Ummmm, I think I may have actually won a game last night!

@BlindDaley the big difference today. Great performance as DM which let the attack do their job. Jonny Evans on the other hand.........
@KnowlesyMun decent scoring record for a man with the pace of a wardrobe mind.....
@KnowlesyMun I just realised I typed Jimmy instead of Micky earlier.#whataprick
RT @KnowlesyMun: Diego Costa has broken a record held by Sergio Aguero and Micky Quinn. Yep, that Micky Quinn. Fat boy.
@KnowlesyMun basically, whenever the city/town he played in ran out of pies and gravy he moved on citing personal issues to force a move
@KnowlesyMun The fat, moustachioed, horse fucker Jimmy Quinn scored in his first 6 Prem League games mind....
@tim_cook sorry Tim I appreciate the gift but I don't want the U2 album on my phone in any way. Pls take it back ASAP #DoNotWant #U2 #Apple
I love the IPhone. I have a unhealthy obsession with watches. Surely that means I love the Iwatch then yeah?
@GarethSimms @LeighDublya @oWestyo @sakerman29 Leigh will happily trade him for Ryan Fitzpatrick as its a deal that benefits all concerned!
@oWestyo @sakerman29 @GarethSimms @LeighDublya as usual, a whole team put all their hopes on Manning!
@sakerman29 @oWestyo @GarethSimms @LeighDublya I need something special tomorrow night
@oWestyo @GarethSimms @LeighDublya @sakerman29 The #NFL app is very impressive. It manages to show me how crap my team has done beautifully!

@AGERussell @TransferRelated @marcflush1 #flipflops
@AGERussell @marcflush1 Its like Ronaldinho all over again!
@marcflush1 @AGERussell As he is on 350k a week maybe he is signing Welbeck as his personal guide?
@marcflush1 @AGERussell Old school glass bottle of Tom K on the foot #metatarsal
@marcflush1 @AGERussell knife edge stuff! Maybe he fell off a treadmill and shattered his pelvis? #injuryprone
But I liked Welbeck, Chicarito and Kagawa! #transferdeadlineday
Just seen the Richard Blackwood @BurgerKing ad. A part of me felt bad for the one time British Will Smith. They led very different paths. 😁
Looks like I had a @ManUtd related social media meltdown last night!
Forgot @SamuelLJackson is in Jurassic Park. Should have known really as he is in EVERY film!
@ManUtd have been very shit but let's not forget to praise MK Dons for playing average to good and thrashing us 4-0.
But our away form is much better than at Old Trafford.........oh! @ManUtd
@Lord_Sugar @ParisHilton I would take her as a new defender!
Next Goal Wins Yeah? @ManUtd #schoolboyfootball
@Adam_Kerrigan cool. I am up for that
Van Gaal "I'm always shit the first 3 months at a new club" Your telling me Louis! #Bolieve
@Adam_Kerrigan definitely 🍺
@Adam_Kerrigan not too heavy 😜 need to meet up with Phil and see what we decide on!
@Adam_Kerrigan I think villa have more going for them this year than United. At least Vlaar can defend!
At the moment we are not a Premier League team let alone a top 4 team.......get Moyes on the phone quick.
I love football and I love @ManUtd. But at the moment Man Utd are making me fall out of love with football #fuckingawful
@HardySingh nope, that was my best mate for one day Lee Martin.
Is he that good though? #DiMaria #59million
@KarisMontague #Balotelli = good signing? I think he is a bargain for £16m. Even if he is a prick can he be worse than Suarez??
@oWestyo @sakerman29 @GarethSimms @LeighDublya ah, I see!
@oWestyo @sakerman29 @GarethSimms @LeighDublya what are waivers? #noidea
