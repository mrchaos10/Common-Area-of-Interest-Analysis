@AntjeWahl @alfalfarocks @BowinnMa @steeletalk @icbc @CKNW Sure, so ICBC does that in BC.

@AntjeWahl @alfalfarocks @BowinnMa @steeletalk @icbc @CKNW That may or may not be a better idea. I'm sure there are advantages and disadvantages. A great thing about ICBC is that they have enormous amounts of data to use in deciding where to spend money to maximize road safety.
@AntjeWahl @alfalfarocks @BowinnMa @steeletalk @icbc @CKNW Its been more expensive lately, no question about that. The mismanagement under the BC Liberals is well documented. But it certainly doesn't have to be that way, the voters can demand it be improved. And I've had far more expensive insurance in other places across Canada.

@alfalfarocks @AntjeWahl @BowinnMa @steeletalk @icbc @CKNW ICBC has an extensive public record. If it's false info and just propaganda, prove it.

@Dmerki01 @BowinnMa @NDP_Logic @bas9860 @steeletalk @icbc @CKNW That's definitely the core of liberal ideology, personal choice above all. I don't see privatization as offering more choices though (and I'm definitely not a liberal), it offers less choice for low income earners (though more for high earners, of course).
@AntjeWahl @alfalfarocks @BowinnMa @steeletalk @icbc @CKNW Why is a crown corporation that contributes resources to building safe roads, starts safe driving initiatives, and offers affordable car insurance not a public service? How are you defining public service?
@AntjeWahl @BowinnMa @alfalfarocks @steeletalk @icbc @CKNW ICBC contributes to the health and wellbeing of BCers by giving money to upgrade unsafe roads for eg.Medical ins fixes bodies, to use your analogy. I fail to see the distinction you're trying to make.
@alfalfarocks @AntjeWahl @BowinnMa @steeletalk @icbc @CKNW No we have univ health insurance.But just comparing private vs public lacks nuance.Properly funded univ healthcare progs have better outcomes for less $ than the American priv health insurance system. Those who can afford it can get their car fixed quickly, those who can't don't.
@Dmerki01 @BowinnMa @NDP_Logic @bas9860 @steeletalk @icbc @CKNW A crown corporation is not the same as a private monopoly. We have a degree of democratic control over it, and it's purpose is to serve its constituents not profit above all. If u favor privatization that's one thing, but this is a false parallel.
