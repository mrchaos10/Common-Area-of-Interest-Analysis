@Fellaini This guy deserved a lot of respect than he received he was a true professional above all he loves our club you can just see even after leaving his profile pic is still of a utd shirt good luck Fella once a red always a red thank you for the memories
@LiamPaulCanning @markogorman06 I'm going for this order Herrera, Pogba and De gea
@Fellaini @ManUtd Once a red always a red we learned to love you in a difficult way however I wish you the best and good luck
@Vintage_Utd Then there is Valencia ,he is so underrated he has played for us for ten good years even after being converted to right back remember when he used to play 7 then Rafael 2 it was so interesting so he deserves more respect and credited
@Vintage_Utd I disagree coz mata is a great character in out dressing room then there is smalling and lukaku you can't just let them go coz you need a big squad to compete in case of injuries you will surely need them
@reshmikasingh Better than you may think Reshmi
@reshmikasingh @Fellaini We are utd fans we can't do what  fans of some clubs do Fella did a lot despite of harsh atmosphere by most fans he remained professional and even signed new deal even if he is not loved by fans .He is a fighter if he is leaving we should indeed wish him the best Thank u Fella

@reshmikasingh What makes me to wonder is how Ole changed our style and attitude of play within 48hrs and yet it took Jose years to change from Van gaal's style
@ManUtdVines He didn't want Rashford to take it but then he celebrated with much passion after the goal that he even forgot that he never wanted him to take it

@reshmikasingh I too wandered however Jones disproved me
@Dean_mufc88 It was a different case coz today they were passing the ball very first the only problem was a goal scorer
@ManUtd Why should you start Jones yet you have Bailey, I believe Jose wants to prove that he has the worst defense

@reshmikasingh The only way to stop the ones ahead of you is by beating them it's a nice weekend already now we need to win both our next two games it's hard I know but not impossible
@reshmikasingh It was a tough one especially in first  half they were lucky not to concede many in the last 45mins,we are happy with 3 important points however we need to improve on our defense and midfielders  have to start moving the ball faster than we are doing
@ManUtd @vlindelof @AnthonyMartial @paulpogba Martial
@sportbible @markogorman06 @Dipak__Gohil May the souls of the departed ones rest in peace
@reshmikasingh It was a fair game especially that finish by Tony Martial  I have been reading a lot about Ronaldo this Ronaldo that, wait a moment that goal by Martial was more composed finish but because he plays for utd we won't see it on head lines
@ManUtd Drop Lukaku once and for all other players deserve a chance too
@OSlickzz @reshmikasingh When someone tells you that you can't do it you tell them just watch me do it. I trust in our team and manager many thought we were going to be blown out by Chelsea at the end they needed 6 extra mins to match us

@MrBryanDavies Dave,Shaw,Smalling,Andres,Mata,Herrera and Martial I know many would want smalling out but he is the only defender we have who is always fit
@RedDevilBible Shaw deserves more than that
@RealTalkMUFC Especially at home however we need at least 3 players in January no club needs that market more than us
@ManUtd Our duty is to support our manager we hope the rumours aren't true in Jose we trust
@utdxtra @GNev2 It would surely be shameful well said aGNev2
@ManUtd Martial
@reshmikasingh We hope for the best I still trust in our manager
@reshmikasingh Trust me Jose adores our club he showed both frustration and Passion today believe me if the boys can play like they did in second half things will surely turn around
@markgoldbridge I thought mark was a reasonable person but after reading this I lost respect for him I know it's tough to be a utd fan at the moment but we have to be strong,support our team and hope for improvement not criticising and wishing the team to loose so that a manager may sucked
@utdxtra Lukaku needs a rest
@GOtvUganda @PearlMagicTV You should have put it in Gotv plus for the start not max
@reshmikasingh We need our players to be at their best so good luck to the boys
@KellyFosters Oh Kell
@reshmikasingh We surely need another striker in January
@Vintage_Utd Do you think whatever Pogba has been saying on media is good for a team as a leader? Stop blaming the manager or shut up because the club is bigger than every player let him go if he wants his not better than Becks,Rinaldo,Rud and many more
@TheUnitedLink What do you want the manager to do when players are not fighting for the badge you can't blame the manager for the past loses
@Memphis @ChampionsLeague @UnderArmour Once a red always a red please come back home some day #iloveutd
@ManUtd It's a tough one but I would go with either Pogba or martial
@reshmikasingh I hope he can return home some day he still loves the club
@ManUtd We all know how good the boy is so should we call you Rashford Fc too? Especially when he does not perform .This should stop they are all our players and we need to support them unconditionally
@ManUtd Can we see the first hat-trick after soo long good luck to the team
@ManUtd Wow wow wow Fred,Pogba,Martial, Rashford and Lukaku all are starting if they can find the balance then this attacking line can be unstoppable
@JayneKennion Just like seeing Liverpool being scored

@rioferdy5 @RomeluLukaku9 @ManUtd I have never seen  Ferdinand crisis our team even if we are down true Legend you will always be in our heart
@UnitedStandMUFC If you were a utd coach would you play Rashford a head of Lukaku? we should thank Jose at least for giving him chances even though it's out of position remember when Lukaku wasn't feet and he "Rash" was playing as a striker against Chelsea many fans wanted him substituted
@ntvuganda @UmemeLtd No way UMEME should stop deceiving Ugandans does it affect only citizens and  not exported power there could be a motive behind that power blackout
@utdxtra @danmay10 He is a strong guy who loves the club that's why he is loved by fans, he doesn't complain when benched and criticised rather he keeps on fighting for his number he should be example to other players like Pogba
@UnitedStandMUFC Would you bench Lukaku or Sanchez for Rashford?
@Devils_Latest @sompoch3303 Oh he would kick pogba for using his mouth always other than legs and brain
@newvisionwire They are hypocrite after they failed to do justice now they have guts to show up there always giving Ugandans empty promises and violating our constitutional laws by arresting and torturing innocent people
@ManUtdMEN Not just because of his comment but his attitude too we can't keep a player whose heart desires somewhere else and can't fight for our budge it's better to sale him and sign Milunkovic Savic as his replacement.
@StatmanDave Bring him back already
@MailSport @markogorman06 Good luck mate you will forever be remembered in a utd history

This can't be a red card for Rashford  there could be some fellows ,officials in FA inclusive plotting against our team as the saying goes it's easy to be number one but difficult to stay number one #iloveutd we are utd therefore we shall fight to prove our worth  to all haters https://t.co/eYqfvcRlij
@HQManUtd @markogorman06 How did rashford get a red card for that he went to confront the guy ,he wasn't the first to head Burt he ends up with a red card and the real culprit gets a yellow that shows how much people wanted us to loose another game but sorry for them we are utd
@reshmikasingh @ManUtd In our last two matches we showed quality,attacking football and speed not packing the bus as before
@reshmikasingh @ManUtd I believe our style of play has greatly changed despite of our resent results
@utdxtra @markogorman06 @mufcaways_ Non of that will be written and said by double standard media guys
@ManUtd Pairing smalling and Iceman is another night mare for us .I believe that if they consider performance wise then he should have dropped Jesse other than Fred and Iceman for Bailey
@MrStephenHowson @markogorman06 Rashford needs to prove that he is capable of leading us yes we know he is a great talent but he needs to be consistent and stop being too selfish however I would not drop pogba for him
@famousalexnield Big up bro next time better we are utd together we shall overcome the present challenges #iloveutd
@5liveSport @PV1350 It's a shame that a fan would be happy when his team loose just because they don't like a manager I still believe in Jose therefore plastic fans must either go out on loan or be ready to dream coz Jose is here to stay
@PV1350 I think your critics of Jose has turned to obsession, personal and baseless our job is to support our manager and players hoping for the best
@newboy1799 Birthday  boy
@ntvuganda He is a great disgrace for Tororo time will come when the hunters will be hunted for now we pray for the recovery of Zaake and others
@ManUtd @LukeShaw23 What are we waiting for to give him anew contract
@PV1350 It's one thing to play for spurs and another for utd at utd you are watched by many and Criticised by millions which will surely put you under more pressure unless you are mentally strong and that's the difference
@utdxtra @danmay10 Well said big Sam
@Pa_Ward1 @manutdirishreds Oh man Fred played very well it was only him and shaw who played to the standard
@nathan_jackz Our problem was striking line and central defense Jose wanted a backup for Lukaku and central defender however the board neglected his request now they should not blame him remember Lukaku is the only proven striker we have if he fails or gets injured there is no one to cover up
@nathan_jackz He did his best today he is not to be blamed
@PV1350 Why should he send Jose out when he is the one to be blamed
@utdreport It's because he did his best but players couldn't take up their responsibilities apart from Shaw and Fred
@reshmikasingh We played a good game with poor goal scorers if you play an attacking game you need to score goals knowing that you will concede too Lukaku and Jese didn't do their job well that's my analysis
@SirAlexWay @iamscholes He was the best cb in the game but shaw was the best player in the pitch
@reshmikasingh Jose should stop gambling you can't bench a player like Bailey just because of one game it could affect his confidence however I'm behind the team and I hope for the best
@iamscholes Jose should stop gambling this is a must win game however I'm behind the team though playing smalling,matic and Jones in a back 3 is a real gamble

@FullTimeDEVILS He surely deserves a chance why send him on loan a gain
@TheManUtdWay @FitzroyWillia16 It can't be a joke because he has to respect the club. He should have gone and return early since most first team players were not around remember Jose's daughter was graduating the day our team was traveling to us but he traveled with the team rather than joining his daughter
@nathan_jackz Maturity  and quality that's why I never wanted Blind to be sold
@reshmikasingh @ManUtd @andrinhopereira Another option in our midfield
@FullTimeDEVILS @sompoch3303 Jose won't surely want to loose though it's just a friendly and we don't have our star players a draw would work
@LiamPaulCanning @sompoch3303 Jones  should be the one to give way not Rojo for Gods sake
@_imran_mufc_ @sompoch3303  https://t.co/r2bwno0UPD
@utdacademy_ Northampton were a better side they deserved a win good luck to the boys next time better
@Michaelfigueir3 @DeadlineDayLive Rojo is better than Jones so it would be fair to trade with Jones instead
@ClaireKilner89 It's better for those fans to go out on loan if they can't support a team at a tough time #iloveutd
@Shane3433 @utdxtra @manutdirishreds the start of our down fall  we should encouraged them and giving credit where it's due
@Shane3433 @utdxtra @manutdirishreds Shane I remember the first matches in Van Gaals reign we were playing beautiful game and every one enjoyed it even with Rooney in midfield against Chelsea but we were not scoring much goals  then negativity started ,blaming and criticising both the manager and players &amp; it was
@MerlinUnited @1965Wendy That is the spirit mate I don't like negativity around our fan base remember we are the richest club and other clubs do want to overcharge us whenever we approach them of cause we can't just give them much money because they want
@utdxtra @manutdirishreds There is unnecessary negativity in our fan base it's our duty to support our manager and players no matter the situation but what I have observed for the past months we are slowly becoming like Liverpool fans
@nathan_jackz He accepted to play in any position we have seen most players being converted from left back to wingers and midfielder to defender so that shouldn't be a problem
@asiblingswish @Rio_F79 @ArianaGrande It's above human knowledge but not God if only they know that Jesus heals they would be on their knees praying right now
@iamscholes How many times will they agree on the terms we are fed up of this news
@SSIIIIUUUU @sompoch3303 Would you enjoy watching youths without trophies?
@BBCSport It's better to sale smalling or Jones than Rojo
@GaryMorrissey1 Hahaha who compares martial to willian martial is not for sale.
@LukeEdwardsTele @markogorman06 If spurs want martial they should give us Kane and Ali in exchange because martial is more talented than both of them
@nathan_jackz @SayNoMore33 If martial keeps on doing what we all know he is capable of until the attacking trio returns I believe he will keep his place. We should be happy that Woodward does not want to sale him or else we shall regret just like we did with Pogba
@nathan_jackz @SayNoMore33 Nathan why do you hate martial so much
@utds_updates @sompoch3303 And yet some people are after Joses head for yesterdays game
@GaryMorrissey1 @nathan_jackz He is a natural number 7  very first,talented and has an eye for goal
@nathan_jackz Most people haven't seen the best of Chong yet sometime back I said the kid is too talented for his age  and deserves to be in first team
@ManUtd @AnthonyMartial That was close indeed
@Jade_red_devil Hmm it's on
@manutdirishreds It was better to let him run with the ball than pulling his shirt or knocking him down to avoid a blow or kick
@sampilger @sompoch3303 We can't blame Jose because it's the work of Woodward and the board to sign players that the manager needs
@RatedJesse Courtois is heading to Madrid
@GOtvUganda How many 3 months are needed because I have never seen your airtime
@ManUtd @BlindDaley I'm happy for him on the other hand I'm sad that we lost a multipurpose player just like O'Shea
@redddevils_21 @sompoch3303 Back to the sender that's mission impossible
@BlindDaley @innocent_atma @ManUtd Once a red always a red forever we shall cherish that memory
@ManUtd I remember before Jose went back to Chelsea most fans were blaming Woodward for not going after him and now they want him out shame upon you it's our duty to stand by our manager I love his work Woodward just needs to deliver all what Jose needs and we shall be the champions
@ManUtd We all have seen some great football from pogba under Jose than for France is Jose to be blamed for his inconsistency? Why can't we acknowledged the great work from Jose who develops him for a season for France to gain from Jose's hard work? I believe we have some delicate fans
@ManUtd I'm just fed up of people who claim to be utd fans and yet they can't even stand by the manager we are all aware that it's only under Jose that we have achieved a dream of going back where we belong sis sir Alex left our club why should you blame him for Woodward's failures
@nathan_jackz Every utd fan has to feel for Martial apart from some fans who are on loan at our club but he surely deserved to be there
@reshmikasingh Now that world cup is done we have to turn our attention to preseason tour the lads are off today to US
@reshmikasingh Yah Reshmi they were the best team  with over 61% ball possession today but it wasn't their day believe me there are only 3 teams who played as a team in this tournament France,Croatia and England however I'm happy for Pogba
Oh my God pogba what a goal
https://t.co/I0ZS5mR9X4
@reshmikasingh 3-1 France
@Empire_Mu @FitzroyWillia15 NO
@SkySportsNews Oh my dear Sarri I fear for your career coz in ten months time you will be out of job let alone the dream of 3 years

@PL_PoIIs The best will always be challenged as you all know it's easy to be number one but very hard to maintain number one
RT @PL_PoIIs: Who's better?

RT for Sanchez 

Like for Mahrez https://t.co/ZXW49dlH3M
@PL_PoIIs Always hated but never ignored #iloveutd we all know what Sanchez can do but only because he's playing for utd that hate and rivalry won't allow many to accept the truth
@reshmikasingh Lukaku was more of a team player than Hazard I said it last week that unless the manager solves the issue between Hazard and Lukaku they wouldn't pass France
@reshmikasingh He either wanted to show that he was the main man or that he is the right guy to replace CR7
@reshmikasingh Reshmi it's a tough one for us as utd fans to choose from our 3 players who to support however I hope Lukaku could make a record that could bring smile to all utd fans after Ronoldos transfer to Juve on the other hand I don't want to see pogba sad
#NewProfilePic https://t.co/HgCtmrAWpj
@NewManUtdNews I would take all including Greenwood now that most guys will be in holidays
@reshmikasingh Quality cross from Jesse
@reshmikasingh Including sterling
@utdxtra @GainTeamUnited2 @RomeluLukaku9 @ballfc_ We have to thank Madrid for refusing to sale morata to us otherwise we wouldn't have signed Lukaku
@reshmikasingh It was almost my first time to see Fella currying the ball up front not giving side balls and back passes it was indeed a right decision to keep him in our club
#NewProfilePic https://t.co/kF4roLAhj2
@reshmikasingh It's evident that Hazard does not want to pass balls to Lukaku he rather run and make an attempt by himself than passing it to Lukaku most balls that reach Romelu were from Kevin D
@sheshe_tom The manager has to solve the problem between Hazard and Lukaku before facing France otherwise it won't be good for them  it's evident that hazard is jealous of lukaku  scoring
@reshmikasingh Reshmi can you see what i told you the last time Belguim played? the difference between Lukaku and hazard nevertheless i'm happy that Neymar and Tite are out
@ntvuganda Imprisoned  for love https://t.co/1rLgL8ozUF
@GOtvUganda France and Beliguim
@ntvuganda Why do you punish the poor because  people who use the media for criminal activities could be rich people now what next for students and other low earners who need this for easy communication and yet they can't afford it now
@ntvuganda There is a wise saying that Never kick someone who is already down or else you may regret later
@SalanoMwavari @mhiz_charming @CSpan22 @ManUtd @MarcusRashford @GarethSouthgate @England Lukaku became a completed striker after joining utd and other players under performed because of the pressure put on them by the media and former  players why should we blame all these things on Jose have you forgotten that we are in our best since Sir Furgies time
@Somcee_MUFC Don't forget that kanes 4goals are penalties

@CSpan22 @ManUtd @MarcusRashford @GarethSouthgate @England Give credit where it's deserved Jose has contributed a lot to the development of those young boys why can't you blame southgate for  Rash's luck of playing time  you either do that or shut up can u name 2 players who had more playing time at utd last season than Rushford?
@reshmikasingh It was a tough game now we can rest good night
@maxmufc7 Hahaha Max wakeup
@reshmikasingh I can't believe the coach had to take that long to introduce him they were very lucky
@reshmikasingh Oh Reshmi this is world cup things are not easy at all i was a little bit scared though
@reshmikasingh Is it just me or Hazard never wanted to pass balls to Lukaku at a right time
@reshmikasingh Lukaku
@reshmikasingh It would be the best moment in this world cup for me
@reshmikasingh I feel sorry for him
Come on Dave saves today is your day prove to the world what you are made of #iloveutd https://t.co/UC49zZVm1m
@ManUtdInPidgin @markogorman06 Martial deserved to be in Russia no matter the circumstance i believe there are hidden personal a gender by Dechamp
@ntvuganda @kizzabesigye1 Oh my friend  you know how to take advantage of the situation however this time i approve your point we are indeed fed up of these guys they think that everybody is rich like them they forget that it's not the poor who violate their laws especially social networks
@SimplyUtd @markogorman06 I think this character is taught at PSG i watched Di maria yesterday and he was doing the same I hope the young French lad wont follow  their footsteps
@GOtvUganda Thank you Gotv its unbelievable but true
@MrBryanDavies Bryan that team lucked creativity no one was carrying the ball to forwards from midfield and the manager should have realised that he needed another midfielder and again he should have played Rashford as a winger due to his pace
@iamscholes I hope they will reorganize this team Rashford is not getting enough services and can someone explain why Arnold is taking all set pieces the manager should change  Rashford to number 11
@GOtvUganda It's time for Gaby to rule the Boss https://t.co/TtQrYKsgEb
@ManUtd But because he is pogba and playing for utd he is subjected to critics not praise
@MouTheTactician @markogorman06 The same Fella who scored a winner against arsenal so shut up.
@Devils_Latest @reshmikasingh Besides him speaking crap why can't they speak of Rashfords luck of playing time? if that was Jose then they would be speaking trash about Jose delaying his progress and the boy wanting to leave that's the only thing English media are best at
@Devils_Latest @reshmikasingh He is loosing the respect fans had for him always speaking negative about the players and the manager
@nathan_jackz That is true Nathan Fella is not a starter unless Jose thinks otherwise he might be used as a backup for number ten
@Ryanmufc95 Hahaha and those who slam Dave saves https://t.co/b4zB14jfEN
@Paul1350v3 @Unitedesque Because  he is not De gea
@LastWordOnSpurs @Geddy7777 @PochOnPoint Man utd has 6 lukaku 4,Jese 1 and Rojo 1
@Somcee_MUFC That's true bro
@CanadianRed1 I feel sory to him
@ManUtdMEN @markogorman06 That would be the best decision it would bring more out of him and indeed make him more mature than he is
@Rio_F79 Even smalling and Jones are  better than this spanish defence
@_Inspirational2 "Scared" leads to fear and fear is the greatest weapon of Satan therefore it's not OK to be scared
@ManUtdMEN Jose must be proud just like us
@AndyMitten @markogorman06 Bring him back as lukakus back up
@Devils_Latest @markogorman06 Give him chance already
People do speak a lot about Brazil but i assure you that Belgium is the best team in this world cup they play as steam not individual club rivalries are put aside for example utd,city and chelsea
@iamscholes  https://t.co/cgnY9XdMVQ
Oh my God that is lukaku joint top scorer 4 goals https://t.co/3e7smDlHUQ
@TheSportsman @Geddy7777 It's a shame that you can only look for his poor touches not contributions or goal scoring record
@UnitedStandMUFC @markogorman06 We can't judge him by that game but rejecting over 75m was a gamble he is over rated some do rate him even above  pogba because of some few bad games that pogba had even though we know what he can do if we sign savic they will say he is  average always hated bt never ignored https://t.co/X9jjKMytxK
@PeterBryans @Somcee_MUFC  https://t.co/qdHmzJ6fWV
@Somcee_MUFC When did Portugal play Iceland
@anyamahk @Somcee_MUFC This will surely affect his game if he wants to be at the level of CR7 and Mesi then he should stop that mentality
@Devils_Latest Oh these guys once a red always a red https://t.co/dRgl1stdAj
@iamscholes Not even retiring but he's going to be sucked
@famousalexnield @MarcusRashford He should start Rashford in the next game
@famousalexnield @MarcusRashford Sure
@DrawtyDevil Then Would it be wise to spend 200m on Bale at that age
@ntvuganda First you reported 3 trucks yesterday and now 2 so which one should we take
Tomorrow will be a dream come true for our lads https://t.co/98F99ong12
I can't wait for tomorrow's matches with 7 utd players in action
@CanadianRed1 He was falling and complaining a lot coz he wanted too much protection from the officials sorry for him
@SportsJOEdotie @markogorman06 He wants much protection
@reshmikasingh Check in youtube it was during Van Gaal's reign he said a lot that can offend every united fan that got a chance to watch it, to say that if he was to come to utd he would be the one to teach Rooney so we should go for mane of southampton instead
@reshmikasingh It would make my weekend perfect
@reshmikasingh So annoying i disliked them the moment i watched  Neymar's reaction to his link with united before he joined PSG he said "i don't want to join united a club which has been rejected by pedro ramps pedro,ramos and Xavier above all not even the best in manchester"
@TheManUtdWay @mmathewpoww @CH14_ I still have his Jersey
@PeoplesPerson_ The reason i supported mexico
@aracelyarambula I hope they will manage to keep Germany from scoring,one more goal from mexico and it will be done

A tough night for our goal keeper i hope he comes back stronger

@nathan_jackz Nathan martial is not given enough playing time but he is a very good player almost the most talented in our club at the moment they can't bench him that much and at the same time expect a lot from him
@reshmikasingh I'm feeling headache already reading  utd's transfer news hopping for the confirmation but all in vain
@BarcaRaw @markogorman06 What's  the difference between that and  rashfords goal against liverpool
@nathan_jackz Liverpool loosed the game the moment salah was injured to compete next season they need another goal keeper
@nathan_jackz Hahaha Nathan it was nice to see them loose today but to be honest i wouldn't have supported Madrid if it wasn't against Liverpool i had no choice because it was against Liverpool
@RedDevilBible Now we shouldn't have any problem when it comes to transfers

@maireadmufc @markogorman06 He is our last player among 2008 champions believe me it's going to be too emotional
@ManUtd @premierleague Sanchez played well however Jose wanted to give Moyes a point as a utd diehard  fan am not pleased with jose he had options on the bench its time for him to start respecting the club and fans
@HarryMufc97 That was a straight red card and i believe if it was a utd player believe me it was going to be a red card
@ManUtd @premierleague A very poor display Jose should have done better than that united fans deserve more he should have changed the system right after second half we had attacking players on the bench for Gods sake
@ManUtd Sanchez and a clean sheet for Dave saves 3: 0
@ManUtd Speedy recovery boss
@utdxtra @markogorman06 Get well soon boss
@nathan_jackz Team selection was another factor matic,pogba and fella can't work together pogba was force to pull buck to defend rather than currying the ball forward so the front three had little services then another one was Darmian there is no word to describe his performance
@nathan_jackz It was one of our worse performances of the season first of all Rashford is to take part of the blame he should have passed the ball for his colleague but no he couldn't do that because he is mean and premature he thinks of himself not a team secondly our midfield was too sloppy
@ManUtd @ericbailly24 That's nonsense you can't risk loosing important games by dropping your best defender because you want smalling  and Jones to be in world cup
@ThatsFootballTV @markogorman06 That's nonsense we want premier league and martial is not for sale let me ask you a question can you choose between your self and your son or daughter

@ManUtd Green wood takes all the credit but see that pass from chong  I believe we have great talents for the coming decades
@Realisiah1 If it was to keep two I would go with Herrera and shaw but to keep one it's tough to chose between them however I would take shaw

@SimonCowie11 @_DavidLeRoy_ @tubby0712 @ManUtd @FA They couldn't spend such amount because big name players rejected to play under them otherwise they would have spent even more talk of kroose,Bale,Ronaldo and others rejecting Moyes and van gaal
@_DavidLeRoy_ @SimonCowie11 @tubby0712 @ManUtd @FA You are wrong man Moyes bought mata at 38 millions and fella at 27 totalling to 65m
@Alexis_Sanchez Please come back stronger so that you can improve our team after the break #utd fan all the way from Uganda Africa
@ManUtd @TahithC I hope the manager can give him a chance next season he is a tricky and talented young right winger and the only promising one at the moment
@theDB7 @juanmata8 @famousalexnield He is absolutely a fantastic person I hope he could finish his career from utd
@ManUtd Rest in peace
@ManUtd May his soul rest in peace once a red always a red
@ManUtd The first to sign contract extension since sir Alex Cong's the special one
@juanmata8 @ManUtd Please sign a new contract our dear special Juan the creative king
@DeadlineDayLive Sanchez you made a right choice utd is a real Manchester
@ManUtd @Alexis_Sanchez Sanchez is a great signing for us though am disappointed of mikhi leaving for arsenal for God's sake his not happy
