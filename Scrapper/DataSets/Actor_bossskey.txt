@riz007_007 @Holdthedoor19 @cricketworldcup @BhuviOfficial India has got a  strong team with match winners.  But script is they will play well during the primary phrase.  When it comes to knockouts they may have a off day. 
Like 2015 , they ⚒️ everyone till the semis and knocked out by Aussies same thing might happen.
@riz007_007 @Holdthedoor19 @cricketworldcup @BhuviOfficial India will rock till the semis. And will get knocked out..  That's the script written by God.

I bet u they can chase up to 350 .
Terrific comeback by them after being bundled out.
@Pradhyoth1 @swing_seam More than Ghill I want Pandya to to be back. His exclusion spoils Team s balance.  If india can two wrist spinners along with bumrah 70% of bowling woes won't be there.. With hardhik and bhuvi as supportive roles..
@Pradhyoth1 @swing_seam That idiot is talking about incoming balls where Shaw s feet moving nowhere.  Lol he can work on his weakness unlike KLR who is a shit and gets out regularly in that way.
@Pradhyoth1 @swing_seam Rayudhu and Dhoni shouldn't be playing in the same team.
@Pradhyoth1 @swing_seam That's the problem Rayudu needs min 25 to 30 balls.  He will accelerate I agree but he takes long time, when he gets out he puts next batsman under huge pressure. 
Dhoni is pure shit he scores 2 runs per 10 balls which is a crime in odis..
@vineethJA @iBM1105 Pakistan had an off day dude. 
Have some milk and sleep kiddo.
@Pradhyoth1 @swing_seam Dhoni should be kicked out ASAP.. 
His SR is below 30 s for first 25 balls. Even Pujara can score at better SR.  Vihari can hold end up he can score at 90 s to 100 SR. 
Rayudu s SR is around 70 s which is piss poor
@iBM1105 Both won't be successful I bet u
@Pradhyoth1 @swing_seam Vihari deserves a chance in odi format the guy is talented and looks technically perfect except for short balls which he can work on.

@AqibMansoor5 SA need min 350 to win from here on
@Pradhyoth1 @ChennaiIPL Delhi will rock this year.
@DaKingInDaNorff Rayudhu and DK are consistent performers..  Wait till NZ series to take a decision
@DaKingInDaNorff Dhoni huge problem.. Thing is he will play till the 2019 WC..  
No body has guts to go to him and tell him about his shit SR which is far less even for test cricket..
@DaKingInDaNorff After 2019 WC india will have players like Ghill in the middle order and pant lower down d order. Wait for sometime

@iBM1105 India aren't interested in Fielding
@DaKingInDaNorff @cric_infinity Jadhav is pure shit. 
India can play either DK or Pant. 
And trust these 5 bowlers, in case rayudu can bowl ..
@DaKingInDaNorff @cric_infinity India s best bowling line up
Bhuvi
Boom 
Pandya
Kuldeep
Chahal
@DaKingInDaNorff @cric_infinity India s world cup chances lies with Pandya s selection.
@DaKingInDaNorff @cric_infinity Hardhik will make huge difference.. 
If he is playing then India can play two wrist spinners.

If he says there 10 overs then KAME OVER saffers.

He could be Pakistani second best batsman in terms of solid technique after Babar.
Asad Shafiq technically perfect. 

Perfect choice to replace S.Malik after 2019 WC in limited over format.
Babar Azam is pure class..

Babar s master class 150
Or Sarfraz s captains knock of 125 
Or Imam s gritty 100 runs under pressure. https://t.co/Z1XbiMPGmE

In 3 spells rounds of 5 overs per spell..  Which means..  

Per 6 balls he will create a wicket taking opportunity vs Virat who is the best batsman at present.

#Thuppakimunnai all possible comeback hit for Vikram Prabhu and Hansika.
Few of my predictions went wrong because Kohli and Rahane batted beautifully. 

*They can't survive against the second new ball.  India will score max 225 runs. 

Atleast 100 runs lead for Australia. 

🇮🇳 done and dusted in this test. 

No chance for comeback.

I been following this wonderful game of cricket for past 2 decades. 

According my expert analysis 
Australia would murder India at Perth..  Indian batter don't have skills to survive against pace and bounce.  

So 1-1 Australia at Perth
Justin Langer warned Indian batsman before the Perth test. 

It is evident that it's going to be a spicy pitch.  I don't think Indian batsman would survive for 2 sessions.

@Stevenr22927007 @FoxCricket @tommorris32 350 min 
Which will give them a 100 runs lead I believe batting last on this pitch going to be tough. 
So first inns lead crucial for the Aussies.
@Stevenr22927007 @FoxCricket @tommorris32 Australia allowed India to score 250 after having them on mat. 
They should have knock over them with mere 130 runs in the first inns.
@CricketAustFan Bro pitch is a road. 
Min 400+ needed. 
Which gives them 150 runs lead in the first inns.  I expect them to score at least 400 runs.
@CricketAustFan Australia will post a mammoth first inns total bro
Australia will score min 550 Runs in their first inns
Can India make Australia bat again in the second inns?  
Only question left to be answered..

@swing_seam @rahaneswarrior @pradeepASSRR This is Rahul s second tour to Australia... 
Let's c Max he will play in the first 2 tests then will be thrown out.
@swing_seam @rahaneswarrior @pradeepASSRR Rahane will be ready to open if he wants too.  He is a team man.  I bet u, he will average around 50 s as a test opener. 
U can't even think forming a team without him.  Go to man for Indian in overseas. I rate him along with Virat in overseas..
@father_second @swing_seam @rahaneswarrior @pradeepASSRR I know 🐒 aren't allowed anywhere near the 🏏 field.
@swing_seam @rahaneswarrior @pradeepASSRR Still India s best batsman overseas after Virat is Rahane. 
Rahul is a failure product. Young Shaw looks promising him and Rohit can give India the start not with shit rahul.

@father_second Note 
India vs Australia 
4-0 Australia  my prediction.
@monsttweets 2 films can accommodate. 

Suppose ajith, rajini films na kastam. Suriya na pannalam. Let's c what's gonna happen
@ISkarthi @Vigneshcdm1 @Trendswoodcom @JamesKL95 @akshay14793 @Thooku_Durai Varatum sun pictures corporate monster.  Eppadi venumalum twist pannividuvan.

My guess. 
NGK April 
37 diwali 
Sudarkonda Dec 
Suriya will have 3 movies in 2019.

Then Si4 Sun pictures will be summer of 2020.
