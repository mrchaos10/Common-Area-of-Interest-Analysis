@kirstyjean @handee @toggl For toggl I have a ‚Äúgeneral email‚Äù project that is for when I‚Äôm screwing about in the browser not focused working on a project. (Whole days can go on this if I‚Äôm not careful - and that‚Äôs one of the reasons for tracking!!)
@kirstyjean @handee @toggl Hehe. Soooooo - I don‚Äôt track that. It would be good, but I‚Äôve found a pomodoro app (I have Be Focused in my phone and use https://t.co/9roRZuMnOw online) is better for staying away from procrastination treats.

Whatever works for you though!!

Ah! And on my original point above: maybe you do have to experience loneliness at some point. It‚Äôs an adaptive process. The distinction may be what is a typical and necessary experience of loneliness, and what leads to psychological harm? #MQScienceMeeting https://t.co/p2um2ZrvgZ

I was chatting w @npscience last week and she commented that open projects just don‚Äôt have the time/person hours to collect their metrics. I think this is a great example of that problem.
@betatim @choldgraf It *is* money at the end of the day. So how can we give employers a framework that this *counts* for impact.

I‚Äôve been talking about this at the Turing for 2 years. People who hold the purse strings &amp; assess success are willing to learn, but we have to tell them what we want!
@betatim @choldgraf Gotcha. I agree that it‚Äôs hard for small projects.

@AilsaDon Sorry - I had taken the circulation directly after the meeting to be implicit. Thanks for clarifying.
@vcheplygina @dna_heligrace So fun! I love this!
@Dr_Rosti But actually learning from each other and building community is an awesome outcome and - in my experience - really motivating!
@Dr_Rosti Yep - I think that's the goal. I've been in lab meetings (similar to the meetings in the blog post) where the PI just goes around and says: what have you done (where's my paper?) to each person. And those are exhausting, stressful and useless.

@sanli Also, LOVE that the ECRs designed the meeting. That's the most useful and empowering aspect I think!
@sanli My experience has been that its often hard to get people asking questions for things they need help on at the start of the meeting....but by the end there are often lots of discussion going! I'm really interested in trying to get that interesting conversation started earlier!
@sanli That's fun! I have a similar thing for 1:1 weekly meetings, but I love the idea of a little bot that pulls specific topics into the agenda :)
RT @robingalipeau: Whoever @ottawacity is responsible for these creative signs... you rock. https://t.co/uAbG2Lv5SV
One of the greatest skills I learned in my postdoc was taking minutes in meetings. There‚Äôs close to no use in transcribing everything that‚Äôs said, but a list of actions is üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞

Circulate them 1 week before the next meeting and then that‚Äôs your next agenda! üí™üöÄüéâ
I‚Äôm also a bit worried that I‚Äôm about to introduce a lab meeting! Which can be the ultimate status meeting that everyone hates. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

In my defense: the goal is to build connections between the different projects. So hopefully *not* the ultimate in boring and a waste of time ü§ûüèªüò¨ü§ûüèª
I have to say - not postponing decisions is hard for me. I find it hard to make important decisions without having the folks who have done the prep work there with me.

I do think the meeting can be small: one person summarising the discussion, and can end early! üí™
Meetings are a bit different in academia - for good and for bad - but I LOVE the focus on sharing the purpose of a meeting in advance, on keeping meetings small &amp; on not postponing decisions. https://t.co/rjanuikI7o‚Ä¶ https://t.co/hQnm7zXiSO

@wmvanvliet @eglerean @CyrilRPernet @eknahm @emdupre_ @brainhackorg @dat_project @datalad @LindaDouw Does this loop back to the beginning of the conversation about needing a centralised infrastructure? If people aren't downloading data to their local machines?

(Not criticising! Just noting how difficult this problem is to balance the different ethical challenges!!)
@eglerean @wmvanvliet @CyrilRPernet @eknahm @emdupre_ @brainhackorg @dat_project @datalad @LindaDouw I think we agree that it would be really hard....but I don't think it would be unsustainable. It would mean a very different style of communication with the data owners (participants) though. It would mean keeping them much better informed about opportunities than we currently do

@CyrilRPernet @eglerean @eknahm @emdupre_ @brainhackorg @dat_project @datalad @mydataorg Each participant owns their data.
@wmvanvliet @eglerean @CyrilRPernet @eknahm @emdupre_ @brainhackorg @dat_project @datalad @LindaDouw I agree with you, except that I'd prefer to phrase it as the participants having control rather than the researcher. Which is very close to the spirit of what you say, but would be implemented very differently :)
@eglerean @eknahm @CyrilRPernet @emdupre_ @brainhackorg @dat_project @datalad @mydataorg Its radical to actually put the data back in the hands of the participant.....but potentially very very cool. And I think it absolves the university from their responsibilities quite nicely.
@eglerean @eknahm @CyrilRPernet @emdupre_ @brainhackorg @dat_project @datalad @mydataorg I don't think universities *want* to own data, I just think they've dug themselves into a paternalistic hole and can't find an easy way out. I don't (personally) think open is the way to go, but this type of managed access BY THE DATA OWNER might be really awesome
@eknahm @eglerean @CyrilRPernet @emdupre_ @brainhackorg @dat_project @datalad Do you know about @OpenHumansOrg?

@eknahm @emdupre_ @CyrilRPernet @eglerean @brainhackorg Yes! I‚Äôm watching the decentralised projects (@dat_project in particular) to see how they come up with governance solutions. The peer to peer part is super tough if there‚Äôs sensitive personal data (but maybe not impossible?) and really really fantastic for maintaining datasets!
@eknahm @emdupre_ @CyrilRPernet @eglerean @brainhackorg Propose a better one. And then maintain that one. And then convince the (small c) conservative university legal teams that this new system is better.

These aren‚Äôt technical problems, they‚Äôre social. And they‚Äôre heavily reliant on better sustainability of alternative tools.

@eknahm @emdupre_ @CyrilRPernet Yes. And I think standard text/responses are a really valuable resource.

@samhforbes What I mean by ‚Äúnot using issues‚Äù is the use of them as a project management tool, or a place to have discussions and get feedback. Most folks think of them only for bugs.

I think you‚Äôre missing some functionality if you only use issues for bugs but that‚Äôs a lab decision :)
@samhforbes My other big recommendation is to remember that *git* and *GitHub* are very different skill sets. I know lots of people who are git wizards but don‚Äôt know how to do a pull request and don‚Äôt use issues. So train for both skills
@samhforbes The number of notifications is really tough. So keep having lots of conversations about how to best communicate. There are GitHub options to manage notifications but they require some common ways of working (knowing when to tag etc) that only humans can determine
@samhforbes My philosophy is to focus on the in lab training and build up confidence so they can make later projects open if they‚Äôd like.
@samhforbes So I have chosen to go with a bunch of private repos: https://t.co/dxy3QTYuTB

She points out the centuries of compound interest that white British people have benefited from. In fact, the amount paid to slave OWNERS (not the people actually harmed!) was so great it was only paid off in 2015 https://t.co/0TiJqzovek
The first chapter is about the history of black people in Britain. It‚Äôs quite different to the history in the USA for a few different reasons. One that struck me was that the British participants in the slave trade benefitted from it but didn‚Äôt actually see its violence.
She also acknowledges how ironic the title is - she‚Äôs mostly talked to white people about race ever since her blog post in 2014!! And of course this book is helping white people (like me) better understand structural racism.
In the preface she explains the title and says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see giving up as a sign of weakness, but as an act of self preservation.‚Äù (I‚Äôm remember quoting so that might be the gist if not exact.)

‚ÄúYes and‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work when you‚Äôre disregarding someone‚Äôs pain or questioning their humanity.

That only causes more harm.

Two quick notes.

I know Fey isn‚Äôt perfect. She‚Äôs had some very white comments and I think her messages tend to miss structural problems. I‚Äôm endorsing the improv rule of ‚ÄúYes and‚Äù and nothing more here.

@DimitraBlana @choldgraf @mybinderteam @rachaelevelyn @turinginst Another aspect of our project is to run a research software engineering focused workshop to try to build up capacity for folks in universities in the UK to host binder hubs themselves. THEN you can work with sensitive data more easily.
@DimitraBlana @choldgraf @mybinderteam @rachaelevelyn @turinginst Yay!! Loved that talk at Turing!

The point about setting up environments being hard is A HUGE motivation for me to promote binder!!

How sensitive is the data you work with? That‚Äôs a challenge with the *public* binderhub (not if you can host your own)

@DimitraBlana @choldgraf @mybinderteam SO COOL! We should have the eventbrite up in a couple of weeks. One in Manchester and one in London.

When you were discussing binder - what was it that made you want to use it? (I have my ideas, I'm just curious as to what folks said in lab meeting!)

@NeilLewisJr @AlxEtz My feeling is that most folks in academia weigh teaching higher than invited talks and service so if you can make a good case that it was truly a pedagogical exercise (not just a demo or a research presentation) I‚Äôd go for teaching.
@NeilLewisJr @AlxEtz (And adding having read another reply, if you don‚Äôt give many talks then invited talks!!)
@NeilLewisJr @AlxEtz I think it depends on a) who is reading your CV (what the job requires) and b) where you have the least content. If you don‚Äôt have much teaching experience then put it there, if you don‚Äôt have much service then there.
@psychemedia Awesome! Thank you Tony!

Would you mind please replying to the discourse post? I think that makes sense as the best place to coordinate....at least at this early stage!
@libbykinsey YES! This is great. I had only thought about print as a v common difference between 2 &amp; 3.

I was kinda hoping for package differences because I think they‚Äôre a bit more subtle and therefore easier to miss. But this is a very nice one that‚Äôs ALSO hard to notice :)

@choldgraf @emdupre_ So "NOPE" or similar error message is very easy to do....but it might be more fun to see how code still RUNS but gives you different answers.
@choldgraf @emdupre_ Hehe - the goal is to build a tutorial where we tell people to change the package version in the requirements file and then see the different answers in their binder notebook!
@BioTurboNick You can only have 3 collaborators on those private repositories. So its not as good as the educational discount.
No need to be fully open if you're not comfortable doing so! Totally fine to have a little on ramp to your working open lifestyle ;)

@_DarrenPrice Definitely not neuroimaging specific - it's in the context of (all of) data science. I was thinking super simple - like a number that's rounded differently, or the length of a string with emojis treated differently?
Heya! I'm looking for really small examples of getting different results when using different package versions. I know the big problems come when a bunch of packages interact weirdly together but I'm writing a tutorial and would love just a little example. #Python or #R ideally!

https://t.co/46jmytQblM
Thank you to everyone who has shared the job ad and these various twitter threads.

One last big share before the deadline on THURSDAY 17 JAN!!

I‚Äôm SO EXCITED to read your applications. ü•≥ü§©ü•∞üòçü§™üôÄüëæ https://t.co/BIByXI5VsT
As I‚Äôve said over and over in all my various tweet threads over the last few weeks:

I BELIEVE IN YOU.

Specific technical experience is not as important as your ability to learn new skills and to communicate across diverse communities.

https://t.co/a4cEpKPBfJ
Show me that you‚Äôve thought about it. Show me that you share our values (or how you‚Äôd prefer to enhance them).

Tell me who you are and what you‚Äôd like to do.

Make it easy for me to check the box that says YOU are the best fit for the role.
Let‚Äôs try to wrap up.

DO link your CV and cover letter to the requirements and the responsibilities of the role.

DO NOT go through the items on the job ad one by one in order.

CURATE your application.
(I‚Äôve just realised how ironic it is that I‚Äôm writing a massive tweet thread about being brief. Whoooops!) https://t.co/tZJ1GSggfq
You don‚Äôt have much space üò±üò±üò±

You can‚Äôt tell me your whole life story.

Use the cover letter to focus my attention on aspects of your CV, but don‚Äôt repeat them!
As with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a clear communicator‚Äù saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a good collaborator‚Äù doesn‚Äôt carry much weight.

TELL ME of your collaborative successes. Model best practice by celebrating others in your teams. Make me excited to work with you!
What are you excited about? Why would this position be a useful stepping stone on your career path? Why are you a great fit for the goals?

What do you bring that the team doesn‚Äôt have? What will I learn from you?
An essential requirement is that you have an understanding of #Autism, #Neurodiversity, and the barriers faced by members of traditionally underrepresented groups.

This is difficult to show on your CV. But there are SO MANY WAYS you can tell your story in your cover letter. https://t.co/3wI7QyAo1L
This is the place to communicate that you UNDERSTAND THE JOB.

Read the values document.

Think about why this position aligns with your career goals.

TELL ME THAT STORY.

https://t.co/EbbymgcedD
On the other hand, if your cover letter is more than 2 pages I‚Äôm going to be suspicious.

With effort &amp; a lot of thought, you CAN write a shorter letter.

I don‚Äôt think with all the requirements in this job ad that you can submit 1 page (KUDOS if you can though!) but 2 is enough.
I don‚Äôt mind how long your CV is. (Academic CVS can be pages and pages. This is NOT the case in most areas!)

But it has to be easy to scan.

Bullet points and links are lovely.
And now let me transition to the cover letter by reiterating that formatting in your CV is SO SO SO important.

It takes too much cognitive load to trawl through big paragraphs of text.

LESS IS MORE.
Imagine I have to go and justify why I want you to a big senior person. (This isn‚Äôt the case, but imagine!)

Which lines in the document am I going to point to?
My biggest piece of advice is HELP ME HELP YOU.

I WANT to hire you.

Advocate for yourself in the CV.

Go through the job description and make sure that every piece of experience that provides evidence for why you can do this job is IN THE DOCUMENT! https://t.co/LmT5C9cNAP
Your CV and cover letters themselves will tell me if you can communicate clearly!

The same goes for being able to code. Give me links to your GitHub/GitLab repositories. Tell me what you‚Äôve built. Even if it‚Äôs just for fun make sure it‚Äôs on the CV. https://t.co/FyTEVG9rtZ
If you try to say you have a great ‚Äúability to communicate clearly and effectively‚Äù in your cover letter you‚Äôre just wasting words.

SHOW ME that you can do this! Given talks? Got any teaching/training experience? Written blogs? Made YouTube videos? Links please! https://t.co/DK6edfxJXm
Make sure that the most relevant pieces of experience are on your CV!! Don‚Äôt follow a standard template without thinking about it.

This job ad has a HUGE list of requirements. You do not have space to address all of them in your cover letter. So make sure they‚Äôre in your CV!
The reason I ask for a CV is because I want to see where you‚Äôve been.

Your cover letter is going to tell me where you want to go (and maybe draw some attention to highlights of your past) but the CV tells me what you‚Äôve done so far.
Let‚Äôs start with the CV.

No one is going to read this in depth until the interview.

FORMATTING is key.

Make sure that it is incredibly easy to scan your CV and pull out key achievements.
Here‚Äôs a screenshot of the application procedure from the job ad. It asks for a CV, contact details of your referees, and a covering letter.

Not much, right?

I think this makes the application pretty freaking hard! Let me explain why. https://t.co/0ZXZQrFgGT
Let‚Äôs start by saying these are only my opinions. I‚Äôll justify them so I hope they make sense to you. But different selection committees will have different requirements. Don‚Äôt over generalise to different positions :)
Last twitter thread for this job with me, @AutisticaUK &amp; @turinginst! Because the deadline is THURSDAY 17 JAN! Just two days to get your application in üò±ü§óü§©

I‚Äôm going to give you my opinions on how to write a good cover letter. I hope they‚Äôre helpful!

@jtth @AutisticaUK @turinginst Definitely sub-optimal! I‚Äôm not trying to argue against you. There are many MANY problems with how much we get paid in academia and for what types of reward. I personally think that by making the outputs totally #OpenSource we can at least make the next position easier to get!
@jtth @AutisticaUK @turinginst The salary is tough. It‚Äôs good for an academic postdoc but clearly nowhere close to an industry position. The 2 year fixed term is the same! There‚Äôs nothing I can do to improve that at this point. Which is why the #FullStack experience can be developed on the job.
@jtth @AutisticaUK @turinginst It wouldn‚Äôt be impossible, but a lot of the first year of work would involve design work with members of @AutisticaUK‚Äôs Discover cohort and as both the Turing and Autistica‚Äôs offices are in London I suspect that the position will require quite a bit of in person work.

@spacedoutsmiles @Autism_Positive @AutisticaUK @turinginst I don't want to try to convince you to feel differently. But maybe just assure you that I have thought through the relationships in this project and will continue to re-assess as I go along.
@spacedoutsmiles @Autism_Positive @AutisticaUK @turinginst My hope - echoed in our values and outcomes statement - is that we'll build ways of working that can be used to shape better research in the future for many other studies/projects to come.

@spacedoutsmiles @Autism_Positive @AutisticaUK @turinginst This project - the citizen science project - is entirely separate to AIMS_2.

I do understand that some members of the #Autistic community are very unhappy with @AutisticaUK and I'm sad that we might not get their voices in our project.
@spacedoutsmiles @Autism_Positive @AutisticaUK @turinginst I find @AutisticaUK's reasoning in this thread convincing. I think they made a hard decision with a lot of thought behind it: https://t.co/63oeA0LE1e

@chrisXrodgers (I‚Äôm also a big fan of managed access for human data for mostly ethical and partially reporting reasons....but that‚Äôs kinda a different topic)
@chrisXrodgers In sum - CC0 is most correct, but I think CC-BY is a very very good stepping stone if you are feeling more anxious about getting some credit for your hard curated &amp; collected data.

Also, strong endorsement for: ‚ÄúThings are going to be confusing for a while.‚Äù
@chrisXrodgers Having said that, there‚Äôs nothing I disagree with in the blog post. They make a totally logical argument about the legal position and that ‚Äúcheaters gonna cheat‚Äù. I don‚Äôt feel the same confidence that scholarly norms will lead to citations, but I‚Äôd love to be wrong!!
@chrisXrodgers So - most #OpenData advocates recommend CC0 because the data doesn‚Äôt BELONG to the curator and it maximises reuse (as said in the blog).

I personally like CC-BY because I think people don‚Äôt know HOW to credit data and I like the nudge to include some attribution.

I'm so excited about our values for this project. They're all written out in a document attached to the job description, but I've also screen grabbed them for easy twitter reading in this thread üëáüèº¬†https://t.co/SqNrDGCEpc
The deadline for job applications is JANUARY 17.

Please let me know if you have any questions. And please share widely!!

Here's a thread of threads about the post that I've written over the last couple of weeks: https://t.co/8tosB2xtIF
The postholder will have a lot to be working on! And it's all #participatory so the exact work will have to be designed, and developed.

But the core values are fixed. We stand together.

(The exact wording can be adjusted if they're badly phrased - please send any suggestions!!)
The same document has our outcomes: 

‚ú® Online #CitizenScientist platform
‚ú® Curated #FAIR dataset
‚ú® Two (hopefully overlapping) #Communities (#CitizenScientists and #Developers)
‚ú® A few suggested publications to share what we've learned

https://t.co/EbbymgcedD https://t.co/MO9GNmz2a3
A lot of these values are overlapping. They all define ways of working to ensure an #Open and #Participatory community where everyone is welcome.

What I love about these is how - when I re-read them - I can see so clearly the ways they will empower us to build and grow our team.
RESPECTFUL CONDUCT

We will not tolerate #bullying or #harassment. We will ensure that all community members have accessible pathways to report unacceptable conduct. No member of the team is above the requirement to treat each other with #respect and #acceptance. https://t.co/88QLou84bJ
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION 

We are committed to #equity for all. All members of the project will be expected to recognise and identify barriers to inclusion and actively work to remove them. We will build and maintain a community that is supportive of difference. https://t.co/JSIhhJZw0d
OPEN SOURCE 

While the data will be available under managed access, all code and protocols will be build openly and shared with an #OpenSource license to permit the highest levels of adoption, re-use and improvement. https://t.co/GjgQpv3DlH
PROTECTION AND CONSENT

We will maintain the highest ethical standards of #DataManagement and #DataProtection. We will build accessible and transparent consent models - in collaboration with the #Autistic #CitizenScientists to ensure these are clear and meet their needs. https://t.co/3uLSEqYyOL
TRANSPARENCY

We'll explain our aims and motivations at the start and stay in contact with our community regarding future collaborations, who has access to the data, and WHY they're working with it. (And ensure contributors can revoke consent for these extensions as they prefer). https://t.co/erYcm48oeV
PARTICIPATORY SCIENCE

This project will be built in deep collaboration with the #Autistic #CitizenScience contributors.

This value is heavily inspired and informed by the #NothingAboutUsWithoutUs philosophy from #DisabilityRights advocacy https://t.co/1xUMFJOwFV https://t.co/eHcllvrPoS
IMPACT

Now, I hate the term impact because its been ruined by the marketisation of academia via the REF. But in this context impact means we are committed to doing work that positively impacts #Autistic people's lives as quickly as possible. https://t.co/Ee3HDU9qJM
The values are only loosely ordered. Don‚Äôt read too much into which ones come first etc. They‚Äôre ALL important.

When you apply for the job PLEASE address the values in your cover letter. It‚Äôs an essential requirement that you have a commitment to these values. https://t.co/xvzSYetmJS
The values are attached as a pdf to the job description linked above. Here‚Äôs the direct link: https://t.co/EbbymgcedD

I know I'm tweeting up a STORM about this amazing job with @AutisticaUK to be based at @turinginst &amp; working with me!

DEADLINE 17 JANUARY | https://t.co/VsC6sQps1s

Here's a little thread of threads so you can keep catching up on all the information I'm sharing on here üíñ
Super happy to answer any questions, and I do think this is a big chunk of REALLY VALUABLE work. Just think of the impact we can have on #tech if we show that individuals being informed and empowered to manage their own data can be done! https://t.co/6dX2ea4BJf
My personal gut feeling is that this will be a lot of thinking and "stakeholder engagement" work....but I'm quite confident that much of the technical components have already been developed! I just don't think they've all been incorporated into a project like this one before!
2) There are great teams who are already thinking about these sorts of data control models. @OpenHumansOrg in particular have already reached out about working with them to build a first version.
Regarding @pandamakes question about how much work this is. There are two answers:

1) It will take time. The project is #participatory so it will be designed and built with our #Autistic collaborators. We'll iterate with them on what needs to be built.
SO we need a fine-grained consent model!

Every individual contributor needs to be able to have complete control over their data.

They aren't going to be signing up for some generic T&amp;Cs and losing sight of what's happening!
We'll also maintain the database to be #FAIR under managed access. Maybe other researchers would like to better understand #Autism from the data? Some #Autistic contributors will want to take part in that work, others may not.
BUT another goal is to build a database that can be used for research purposes. Maybe we can run the stories through an #NLP (natural language processing) algorithm to cluster them together? Some #CitizenScientist contributors will be ok with that. Others would prefer not.
One of the goals of the project is to build community between #Autistic people. Ideally they'll feel a little less alone in these challenges, share coping strategies &amp; support each other. A #CitizenScientist might be totally fine with sharing their stories for that purpose.
But you could imagine a different example that was outside someone's house where they're happy to upload the story for researchers to use to understand #Autistic people's experiences, but they don't want to it to be public.
You can imagine someone uploading an experience that is general enough that they're happy to make totally public. Similar to a tweet! "I'm on the jubilee line and there are far too many people, its making me feel panicky" (for example).
In this #CitizenScience project we'll be collecting experiences about the challenges that #Autistic people have when navigate the environment.

For example, is it very stressful to take the tube? (Yes!) Are there times that are particularly bad? (Yes!) What are the workarounds?
What do I mean by a "fine-grained consent model"? At the highest level it's pretty simple: it means I want to give all the participants control over their data. 

What does that mean in practise?
Great question from @pandamakes about the @AutisticaUK @turinginst #ResearchAssociate JOB that you should all be applying for (and telling your friends about). https://t.co/VsC6sQps1s

I'm going to answer it in a little thread üëáüèº https://t.co/DB4vSsUwUq

Stay tuned for a thread tomorrow about #OpenSource and the #Community we‚Äôll need in the project.

(That‚Äôs definitely the BIGGEST focus for me. So much more so than the #FullStack skills or previous academic/job experience.)
There‚Äôs NO reason why you can‚Äôt have those skills from outside academia!

Please do not let the PhD requirement stop you from applying.

The post is probably not suitable for someone just out of undergrad....but never say never! Who know‚Äôs what path you‚Äôve taken to get there!!
BUT! You do not have to have a PhD to fulfil these requirements!!

You will need evidence of independent leadership (of a project or of a team), of looking for solutions to problems (sometimes of your own divising) and of communicating what you‚Äôve learned and what you‚Äôve created.
Not all doctoral programmes provide that opportunity, but many do. And so the point of requiring a PhD for this job is that the post holder needs to be able to see or create a path to building that new knowledge.....and that‚Äôs one of the key outcomes of a PhD (in my opinion!)
And I think the outcome of that is that you can generate NEW knowledge by the end.

I don‚Äôt think this means significant results. Nor expanding a theory. Nor a new method.

I think it means contributing to making the world a better place by adding useful information.
I think a PhD should teach you to be an independent thinker. I think you should have time and space to breathe and read and learn and digest the knowledge around you.
Every PhD is different, and I got mine in the US (Go Bears! üêªüêæ) which is very different to the UK so the following opinions are mine only. Everyone else‚Äôs mileage will vary!
(although maybe we SHOULD give academic credit for that work! Let‚Äôs call that another story for now üôÑüòïüòí)
I tweeted yesterday about the #FullStack requirements of this job.

It seems pretty silly to require web development skills AND a PhD! They aren‚Äôt usually taught together.

@t4templates Yep! Definitely. Project is agnostic to language. Main thing to show is that there‚Äôs a big #OpenSource community behind it üåü
@t4templates It‚Äôs totally understandable to talk about closed source work! Pointing to similar projects might work? Or little demos (but only if you have time!!) If there‚Äôs anyone (a boss?) who can support your application to verify the experience that might also be good?
@lnr_blair @AutisticaUK @turinginst Oooooh it would be so fun to work with you @lnr_blair!! I have a thread coming tomorrow about the research requirement. Again, it‚Äôs mostly about confidence in reading, digesting and synthesising the literature. Something required for a PhD but not exclusively!!
Whoops! This really should have had DON‚ÄôT in capitals ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

You DON‚ÄôT need to have all the skills already üôåüèªüôåüèøüôåüèΩüíûüíñüöÄ‚ú® https://t.co/GZt5oZoTA7
There are a lot of other requirements listed on the job application. They‚Äôre ALL important.

Don‚Äôt get worried about not having ALL the experience!!

I believe in you &amp; your ability to pick up specific skills.

You got this (or your kick ass friend who isn‚Äôt on twitter! Pls RT!) https://t.co/wGh5bHwuT0
Have you built a personal website? Show me that!!

Can you manage a database with #python? #SQL? Ping me a link to the code!

(Not on Twitter! In your cover letter üíñüë©üèø‚Äçüíªüë®üèæ‚Äçüíª‚úçüèº)
Being able to ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS (sorry for shouting ü§£) is BY FAR the most important skill.

Some understanding of what goes into a web-based platform (website, or maybe a web-app, or a mobile app?) is needed at the start. But asking the right questions is the key skill.
This is a #Community built and developed project. We can find you support from a whole bunch of different groups. Some of the #ResearchEngineering team (@turinghut23) will be able to help. Or folks in the @mozilla @MozOpenLeaders @MozillaScience  communities!
So - what I tried to write - and what I‚Äôm telling you today - is that you don‚Äôt NEED TO HAVE ALL THESE SKILLS ALREADY.

All you have to do is convince me in your cover letter (and interview) that you COULD build up enough of the skills to build an #OpenSource platform ‚ù§Ô∏è
I was nervous writing this ad. It‚Äôs asking for A LOT to have someone join an academic project for a salary of between ¬£34,000 and ¬£40,000 if they can do ALL the #FullStack development! There are lots of jobs that would pay you a lot more!!
Here are some screen grabs from the job ad that talk about what you need.... the essential requirements. https://t.co/33AcGq4nRO

So THANK YOU @pennyb. And thank you to all the #ActuallyAutistic folks here on twitter who have helped me learn so much. 

I really appreciate the work you do.

I so hope you‚Äôll all be able to help us build a fantastic project together ‚ú®üöÄüíñüí´
The #CitizenScience project with @AutisticaUK and @turinginst was heavily inspired by my desire to educate non-autistic people about the little things they could do to make the anxiety and stress that #autistic people feel when navigating the world just that little bit lighter.
What I love about this is that it costs me - someone with typical hearing acuity and no sensory processing difficulties - absolutely NOTHING to do this. And it potentially helps so many people in the room.

Not just #autistic people! Anyone who struggles w hearing will benefit.
I remember @pennyb saying: just #UseTheMic when you‚Äôre talking. Even if *you* can hear just fine, there might be someone - like them - in the room who finds it much easier to follow your question if you wait 20 seconds for someone to bring the mic to you.
(I haven‚Äôt rewatched the video this morning - I apologise if I‚Äôve forgotten parts!)

What I remember from @pennyb‚Äôs section is them talking about #autistic people having #SensoryProcessing challenges which mean that hearing what‚Äôs going on in a large conference room is tough.
The video/webinar that stuck with me the most was the one on #Diversity, #Equity and #Inclusion in the #Open community.

And in particular the section by @pennyb which starts around 15:30

 https://t.co/KoyUi8aj9v
In 2016 I was selected to attend #OpenCon @open_con - a conference to support #EarlyCareer researchers in #OpenData #OpenAccess and #OpenEducationalResources. 

We were asked to watch a couple of videos before arriving in #DC to make sure we were all on the same page.
A little thread telling you one of my motivations for this #CitizenScience collaboration between @AutisticaUK and @turinginst.

It‚Äôs about how non-autistic folk can adjust our behaviour to make places easier for #autistic people to live and work.

Be careful of whether people at #MozFest want their pictures to be on social media. If they would prefer not to be photographed they'll usually be wearing a different coloured lanyard for their name badge so it's nice and easy....but it doesn't hurt to ask just in case! https://t.co/oSRubBr5Eh
If anyone calls you out on violating the #MozFest #CodeOfConduct please gracefully apologise and listen to what you did wrong.

Find a trusted friend afterwards to help figure out what you need to change. Don't make the person you've harmed do more work!

#MozFest can be incredibly overwhelming - for new folks &amp; veterans a like.

If I can help to promote your #MozFest session please link to it in this thread and I‚Äôll RT it!
