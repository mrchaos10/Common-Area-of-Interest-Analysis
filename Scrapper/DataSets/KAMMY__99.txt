@ChrisIvanVarela @TheHoopCentral Yes pal, he’s been hoopin. Huge addition for philly
@wojespn 6th feb 2019. The day the Sixers ruined the league
@ShamsCharania @TheAthleticNBA @WatchStadium That is ridiculous. He’s been balling all season. I understand it’s s business but it’s so bullshit at times
@Stiin2k @CoreyElliot Yeah so much respect for knocking over his own teammate and not helping him up🤔
@DerekRuiz2004 @TwoSyncOfficial @EA_GZaro I didn’t have early access. It’s just a glitch. They’ve tweeted about it. Yes u rea that right. EA actually communicated with the community👀

@PabloAndres1981 @Alexis_Sanchez @ManUtd Trynna read this gave me a bad headache🤕
@Yankeesboy26 @celtics Spot on. Even though the non haters also haven’t experienced it, we have some logic and can understand the fact that the guy had no ankle a year ago and didn’t play 5 on 5 for near enough 1 whole year. Anyone with 2 eyes should realise that. We can all see how pg is balling now🤷🏾‍♂️

@sam_avfc1 @markgoldbridge @AVFCPureBrexit Avoiding the point. So ur trynna tell me that if oliveira did that same stamp to mings, you’d say it was an “accident”. Yeah bore off with the delusion villa fans

@OfficialTM_3 @AVFCOfficial Course u do u dirty animal. No one ever wants to see u grace a football pitch again. Embarrassment to urself for even having the nerve to make out as if u didn’t mean it. We haven’t forgot the Zlatan one either

@azizk47 @AdamHimmelsbach @MikeSGallagher Nice way of twisting his words. I’m pretty sure he said he plans on re signing. Shit happens in the nba. There’s so much controversy and twists so he’s not gonna come and say he’s definitely re signing is he?
@182andNotOut @ShamsCharania @TheAthleticNBA @WatchStadium Still gotta win the lottery.

@ManIikeJuan @ChrisSmalling @ManUtd So we can keep watching jones unable to move or stay on his feet and get bullied by every striker.

@TommyJo89182489 @SportsCenter Just an elite mentality. Says it how it is which is something brad Stevens is lacking but he’s young so will become more strict and that will help him become a better coach
@NepentheZ Have u tried vds? Worth getting instead of courtois, considering I have most of the untradables?
@BoltonFraser @TwoSyncOfficial Yeah I just played rivals and it is slower than usual and that’s saying something. Every pass took an hour to get to the player

@andros_townsend @FutSpy @EASPORTSFIFA Yes lad🔥
@Itsparks12 @Eovaldi_Goat @celtics Not that I agree he should be a starter but they say trade him for a reason. So inconsistent. In fact, he’s pretty consistent at being awful

@OB787 @ChrisForsberg_ Y?
@nilay_mukherjee @Londonlife01 @Calteck10 Missing the point but nvm
@natedog4133 @ChrisForsberg_ Yeah that is a weakness that I’m sure most teams will exploit
@CurryForPres @SauceEm_ @NBATV What’d he do? Can’t remember
@OverbeckGaming @NepentheZ He is right footed tho so that’s a bit annoying as I have otw cancelo at rb so wouldn’t replace him
@viscatrabzoon @FutSpy @Tillian1243 U reckon 1 goal as a rw is enough? Don’t know whether to sell my otw for profit
@NepentheZ How’s militao at LB? tempted to try him
@Alex82327377 @GISALEGEND Not a real assist. Don’t think it’ll be enough unfortunately. Came on at rw and scored so
@jakemccaffrey25 @Tobiias @__milan227 Yeah, true. But I feel that they need to do everything they can to find them (alive or not), cos their families surely can’t live on, not knowing if he’s alive or not
@jakemccaffrey25 @Tobiias @__milan227 How’d u know where they crashed? Is it confirmed

@natedog4133 @ChrisForsberg_ But with the addition of a healthy boogie, there’s too many options

@carterwhite0 @ESPNStatsInfo @EliasSports 😂😂 I remember during a game earlier this season, the reporter asked somin like how are u gonna get kd going and he literally said he doesn’t even run the plays anymore. What a tough job he must have

@JBob59_ @celtics Not even surprised at this point
@JBob59_ @celtics I missed most of the game. Let me guess, all 5 misses were heavily contested shots while falling back🤔

@josemorgado @SameenMukadam
@celtics Please brad just play the guy more. Start him with horford at the 4. Mook can then bring his consistency and energy from the bench. Surely it’s worth a try
@BrianTRobb He has a habit of putting up bricks. Never makes them
@celtics 2-3-4 for horford. That’s rough
@Madridlovatic @NepentheZ Personal preference I guess

@MLem_BTown @BrianTRobb He’s averaging 10 points so do ur research my friend. The problem is that he just looks off it in terms of the way he’s playing and that he doesn’t look like he believes he’s gonna make the shots. Must be a mental thing

@HugoHD10 @IPapleaca @ImADuckQuackk @EASPORTSFIFA I was thinking a silver injury card but what ever floats ur boat😬
@f_rob788 @iGoldenBear @FUT_Economist Not ridiculous requirements for nearly every decent futmas sbc and actual daily sbc’s which they falsely advertised. Not much to ask for right?
@celtics @spurs @attcenter @NBCSBoston @NBATV @985TheSportsHub Give him a contract please
@premierleague Henderson OG to gift the title to city😛
@davidoddy @NepentheZ @FutSpy Did it genuinely say daily sbc’s?? Cos that’s false advertising so we should all complain imo
@SF230911 @NepentheZ Bit generous
@Shabbaz77 @TwoSyncOfficial 2g 1a is enough, It’s just they’ve barely ever done it before
@Shabbaz77 @TwoSyncOfficial Reckon it’s possible for b2b informs?
@akbaraska @SkySportsPL This has a like, let alone 5🤣😬
@KylolfcNesbitt @markgoldbridge @xlfctom Any Liverpool fan would say gerrard and any United fan would say scholes. Simple
@mikevvood @MrDtAFC @BBCMOTD @IanWright0 @martinkeown5 Watch it again. It’s hard to see but I’m pretty sure his foot got clipped. Also, when do u ever see Kane complain the way he did. If ur not sure, there are the little things like that which help to tell if it was a dive or not
@ericbailly24 @ManUtd @paulpogba Ur a beast but chill and have a bit of discipline mate👍🏾🔴
@tomjohn71706209 @JTarb8 @MrDtAFC Robbo’s rise is incredible
@rudi_fut @MattHDGamer Looks like you’ve never touched Fifa in ur life🤔
@JTarb8 @MrDtAFC Wijnaldum and who else
@bjornis96 @Tillian1243 @FUTWIZ Oh yeah it’s not about games to goal ratio so he doesn’t deserve it but just letting u know mourinho hated him so he didn’t play
@bjornis96 @Tillian1243 @FUTWIZ He literally played 15 minutes out of the other 3 games so do your research Bjorn pal
@_evanrix55_ @hamiltonjamie74 @MrDtAFC @Bernd_Leno That’s irrelevant. My point is, why would anyone randomly face time someone they don’t even know
@hamiltonjamie74 @MrDtAFC @Bernd_Leno Why would he even answer a face time from a fan🤣
@TwoSyncOfficial 4-2 Liverpool
Wolves👀👀
@_mattlangley @LavCFC @ChelseaFC @didierdrogba Enjoy hazard while it lasts🤫😬
@_mattlangley @LavCFC @ChelseaFC @didierdrogba Oh so a bad run of form isn’t allowed. U and the rest of the haters just have a bit of patience🤫🙅🏾‍♂️
@abdouluigi @bateson87 Says who
@sheppellis @WHU_Jamboo A shot every 2 mins😬
@ByJayKing They just fell asleep. 2.7 seconds is clearly enough time to get a decent look
@ByJayKing Well at least that’s a positive in that he’s been awful. But why tf has he been playing then?🤔
@roberthayes706 @SamIam1575 @KingT843 @celtics A slump isn’t a whole season pal
@roberthayes706 @SamIam1575 @KingT843 @celtics Not sure what your watching then. Stick to nfl maybe
@SamIam1575 @roberthayes706 @KingT843 @celtics It’s funny how mook and smart can adjust fine to being a starter and bench player. Because they’re established nba players with much better IQ. Don’t get me wrong, he’s young and got some talent but his iq is down there with the worst
@roberthayes706 @SamIam1575 @KingT843 @celtics Or more like u need to realise that maybe he’s just not good enough, especially with better players around him
@SamIam1575 @roberthayes706 @KingT843 @celtics I mean if someone thinks Jaylen having 1 decent game is acceptable then I think we know who actually watches the games properly
@roberthayes706 @SamIam1575 @KingT843 @celtics Yeah how did u know😒 open your eyes and realise he’s been awful 90% of the season. U probably think he’s been better than mook, u seem that deluded
@SamIam1575 @roberthayes706 @KingT843 @celtics He was decent enough but this is like a 1 in 15 occurrence. There’s a reason why I can assure u that u don’t often have these debates. Cos he doesn’t give u a performance that deserves backing up
@celtics Kyrie with 13 shots and 7 ft and harden with 26 shots and 17 ft. Sometimes brad needs to just forget plays and let ky go iso cos that isn’t enough shots for a superstar. The bench is now officially shit aswell. Time lord and mook needed from the bench🙏🏾🍀
@RBrady__ @celtics Those calls were actually hurting me. I couldn’t even tell if there was contact but cos it was harden, the refs obviously thought so
@roberthayes706 @KingT843 @celtics A good game isn’t just based on points, Einstein. It seems like Jaylen only tries when the game is done like with that fadeaway at the end
@celtics Good quarter boys👍🏾🍀
@ParryisthePapa @RunTheFUTMarket What so if I redeemed on console tomorrow evening, what would it say?
@ParryisthePapa @RunTheFUTMarket Shit yeah I forgot about that, cheers. Gotta get rid of those 83s on unassigned first😬
@celtics 🙅🏾‍♂️😕
@RunTheFUTMarket Bit random but does anyone know if I had to redeem my rewards before fut champs? I’m away atm so can only redeem tomorrow evening

@paulbray2512 @HarveyHutton2 @antonmacan14 @sbc_tips @MattHDGamer He’ll need like 2 goals at least, next game to have a chance so maybe
@DavidSellz @zaim85461343 @sbc_tips @MattHDGamer Yeah maybe for the month but not overall top scorer. Not even EA could be that silly😂
@zaim85461343 @sbc_tips @MattHDGamer It’s potm not top scorer or where their team is in the league🙅🏾‍♂️

@BrianTRobb @BDCCeltics I love jt but when ur playing in the nba, how can u not consistently put the effort in. If there’s a good enough reason then fair enough but it’s inexcusable imo
@DatDreamWeaver Oh
@HeyyitsJayybee @celtics The season is not 1 game long. He’s been woeful the other 25+. Don’t even know how he’s managed to average 12 points tbh. Huge fall from last season
@DatDreamWeaver Legit?🤣 u got a vid
@Darragh_Rojo @FutSpy Yeah let’s enjoy the game when u can score from 270 degrees and when 90% of futmas has been a rip off👍🏾
@GiannisHive @GFXBUCKZ Same here. Me being the other 1% of that 99%. The effort isn’t even bad. Those wankers clearly don’t understand what missing 2 of the most important players + baynes means
@celtics They just showed Jaylens stats from last year and he’s gone from 40% to 27 from 3🤔 that is a crazy drop. I really don’t know if he’s good enough

@kernoknokker @ozilinho_ @markgoldbridge It’s not when u consider how vulnerable that Arsenal defence is
@ozilinho_ @markgoldbridge Unbeaten in 13 league games yet only 8 ahead of a team who can’t possibly play worse. Think before u tweet pal
@UniqueRiggers @CakeiCS Yeah I was gonna say that but it doesn’t get them extra money as ucl live cards are out of packs
@CakeiCS @UniqueRiggers It’s an illogical move from EA. Who’s surprised at this point
@brfootball 🙏🏾❤️
@deadaccount227 @BTCHDNTKMVB1 @EASPORTSFIFA @sterling7 @premierleague Yeah I get that but ur finishing stat should be based on how good of a finisher u are, not how many goals u score. We can all clearly see that he’s not a natural finisher and scores a lot as he gets a lot of chances. But credit to him for still scoring
@BTCHDNTKMVB1 @EASPORTSFIFA @sterling7 @premierleague I guess u haven’t seen some of his finishing. I rate him as a class player but in Uniteds team he’d struggle to get 10 goals a season
@jaypea_JP @thudthief @UnitedStandMUFC I think that was his point my friend

@FlyingxSamurai3 @celtics_stats @celtics I understand he’s young but I guess it’s more so has he got the tools to be a good enough player (I don’t know what good enough is but u get the point). Look at JT. Way more poised, and much more to his game. I would rather keep JB, but if it’s for AD then fuck yeah
@FlyingxSamurai3 @celtics_stats @celtics It’s not about him making a few mistakes, it’s whether he’s a good enough player/consistently playing like in the last few games

@MLetschka @MattHDGamer Baffling how this excites people. This has no relevance to 90% of the community (the ones that aren’t youtubers) cos they are being asked to spend real money which we all know is a con

@SupportAVFC @aresene_owen @_samhills @0XLADE Come on, Stones blatantly meant that🤣 the keeper was just getting up and didn’t see stones and he just thought it’d be banter to jump on him, which it was tbf
@bateson87 I feel u. Needed to win my last 7 for elite 1 and went 6-1😕
@R9Rai @Fuji720pYT Someone care to elaborate wtf actually happened. I might have cried if I got aidsed up like that
@KingBeeJeremy @SavySavy604 @MemoriesOfYeol @Groome13 @YokaiLUFC @TheVokality @Raptors Can u not read? That’s y I said usually🤫🤷🏾‍♂️
@MicahAdams13 @Rachel__Nichols That’s mad
@xKeLtx26 @celtics True
@jj9853 @uniquetvgaming @celtics Would actually take that. A guy that can consistently rebound and even score
@xKeLtx26 @celtics Why would pels want a 32 year old horford and 2 guys who only wanna take tough shots for the best big in the league
@xKeLtx26 @celtics This team needs kyrie but at the same time, guys like T ro and Jaylen play much better when he’s not there. I dunno if it’s to do with not getting many touches or what, but something has to change imo
@jj9853 @uniquetvgaming @celtics But Tatum still usually finds a way to score, whether that’s being aggressive or making j’s. Jaylen was 1-9 and has been like this for a while. I just don’t know if he’s good enough
@celtics Guerschon played 16 less than brown and still gets triple his points😕
@TherealHassanO @celtics I’d take that all day. Prefer to keep Al but if it means for the best big in the league and a good mirotic then happy days. Shame it’s never gonna happen
@ChrisForsberg_ Hopefully brad is sending a message to some of the players, i.e brown and rozier. They’ve both been awful this season
@SavySavy604 @KingBeeJeremy @MemoriesOfYeol @Groome13 @YokaiLUFC @TheVokality @Raptors Still got Lebrontoed tho🤫 Marcus Morris can clearly guard kawhi pretty well. He was only 11-25 so don’t go comparing his performance to lbj
@KingBeeJeremy @MemoriesOfYeol @Groome13 @YokaiLUFC @TheVokality @Raptors Ur owner is lebron. He took over against raptors. He usually had someone like kyrie or k love to help against Boston. There’s a difference
@Groome13 @YokaiLUFC @TheVokality @Raptors You’d know all about a good regular season, being a raptors fan😉. But I suppose with Lebronto out in LA u might have a chance of making the finals
@VictoriaRaptor @Raptors I don’t get how people still don’t seem to realise how tough their job is. They’re always getting moaned at by both coaches, and even fans. They have 3 of them to focus on 5 matchups. And they have to look for stuff like travels elbows and contact at the same time. Stop crying✊🏾

@5OKRATIS @BissettKieran @EdrihD @bateson87 Which is literally the same as 4 cos no one does half of the 5 star moves. Dead weak foot, shooting and physicals

@TimelineofDays @middlemaster121 @KFletchFin @Castro1021 @EASPORTSFIFA “Bad decision”. I payed 0 coins to do that part of the sbc. They don’t know that most of us are only doing that part for the pack so they should give compensation

@dgsmithward @MyWifeIsARunner @BDCCeltics He’s an average rebounder which is why people with a brain unlike u can see baynes needs to play with him, with Theis/Rob will and Mook coming off the bench for them. How stupid are u
@TwoSyncOfficial How are u finding times finesse shots when ur facing away from goal? They were still just as good yesterday but haven’t tried today

@ptyboxing1 @sportsnews1235 @warriors Ur still missing the point. This has happened before. More costly, it’s happened several times when a team is down and that happens. Imagine if that was g7 of the finals. Kd would probably kill him, that’s how much he’s overreacting

@NepentheZ Stop eating. It’s just so unfair to eat these days🤔😒
@MattHDGamer Hopefully an icon sbc that doesn’t require an icon and costs less than what it costs to buy an icon
@graciestone123 @celtics He hasn’t been able to rebound for about his whole career. I love what he brings but he is a straight up 4 and isn’t a good enough rebounder to be a 5. Let’s just say AD would be a decent little pick up
@celtics Mook has to be in instead of jaylen down the stretch. I don’t get why he wouldn’t play him
@celtics I know it’s early in the season but It just looks like they’ve been made to play. No energy, taking low % shots, out rebounded and getting done easily on pick and roll
@CombineArtwork @celtics Maybe brad wants him to learn the game a bit more before giving him more minutes, which is understandable considering he’s a 21 year old rookie
@CombineArtwork @celtics Just don’t get why he doesn’t play more. He’s the rebounder we’ve been missing. Ofc he’s no AD but he’ll help the rebounding issues massively

@DaltonReese24_7 @celtics Exactly. And there’s people trynna tell me that cos one of our rebounding stats are one of the best in the league, we don’t need anyone🤷🏾‍♂️

@smars319 @ChrisForsberg_ Who actually cares about if he took the shot. If u had a chance to go for 50, would u not take it? He might never get 48 again
@JaydonK9 @celtics Have u seen this team without Horford. He is the glue of the team. Anyone that wants him traded is straight up deluded. Boards arent his strong point but he offers so much. That’s why AD would be perfect at the 5 with him, but that’d probably mean giving up picks and JT or JB
@alextbe_ @ayeshaali91 @celtics But when he was making them at a high rate, I doubt you were complaining then. So suddenly when he’s not making them, he shouldn’t take any🤫🤔

The only real problem with smalling is his technical ability and his discipline, in terms of staying in position.

@Kieran_CCFC @_tashdaviesx @MattHDGamer Not sure how u get taught in wales but u both can’t seem to spell clown properly.

@bradwhit12 @Super6 Goals conceded don’t show if a defence has been good. If u actually watch them, they are still a shambles at the back with only a slight improvement. They’ve rode their luck defensively in a lot of the 11 wins. I actually agree with merson
@GMPunk55 @BostonSportsBoi @celtics I don’t mean they rank low in rebounding but the only one close to being considered a rebounder is baynes and AL is decent with rim protection but there’s no specialists at either. Maybe u haven’t watched the last few seasons

@TyrusThomas_ U only say that cos he’s a raptor. My 2 fav PGs have been kyrie and IT for a while now and I’ve always rated kyrie as minimum a top 3 PG in the league. To say Lowry is better is just disrespek. Kyrie is levels above. I think even Lowry would admit it himself. Looks like ur drunk

@call_mee_kenz @M_V_Beard @miigueelb_ @__sportschief @westbrookpg13sz @ldaoming @JohanBackkV2 @BULLETlN Stop it. Kyrie is better. And it’s nothing to do with being a Celtics fan cos he’s been my fav PG for a few years. Put kyrie in that gs team and they’d have probably won the last 4, not 3. Steph is a hof don’t get me wrong but kyrie has more to his game and is more efficient. FOH
@call_mee_kenz @M_V_Beard @miigueelb_ @__sportschief @westbrookpg13sz @ldaoming @JohanBackkV2 @BULLETlN I’m not saying he’s shit u fool. I’m saying he’s not clutch and he hasn’t been, when needed (albeit not often I know).

@M_V_Beard @THE_JABARI_KING @miigueelb_ @__sportschief @westbrookpg13sz @ldaoming @JohanBackkV2 @BULLETlN If that’s how ur gonna compare them then that’s fair but for me, the better player is the one who comes up big in when it matters most and has proven it in in the finals, which CP3 has never been to, despite being 7 years older. He has more to his game yeah, but no F appearance
@M_V_Beard @THE_JABARI_KING @miigueelb_ @__sportschief @westbrookpg13sz @ldaoming @JohanBackkV2 @BULLETlN So u just gonna forget about the history of injuries with CP3 but say he’s better than kyrie. But cos he doesn’t play for rockets, the injuries make kyrie less valuable than CP3 who’s had countless injuries. Also, APG don’t determine a players passing ability. He’s not shooting
@M_V_Beard @THE_JABARI_KING @miigueelb_ @__sportschief @westbrookpg13sz @ldaoming @JohanBackkV2 @BULLETlN What did those triple doubles get his team. WCF. Kyrie was suffering from numerous injuries throughout most the season so u can’t compare their seasons. We’ll see who’s more successful this season if they’re both fully healthy bro
@THE_JABARI_KING @M_V_Beard @miigueelb_ @__sportschief @westbrookpg13sz @ldaoming @JohanBackkV2 @BULLETlN Man’s trynna tell me harden is better than one of the most prolific PG’s in the league who’s in his prime. Out of all those PG’s mentioned, tell me who delivers when it matters most more than uncle drew🤔
@M_V_Beard @miigueelb_ @__sportschief @westbrookpg13sz @ldaoming @JohanBackkV2 @BULLETlN Na but TP used to be elite. He’s 36 so obviously wouldn’t be in the conversation. The thing for me that separates kyrie is that he can literally get any shot at any time in the game. Also an underrated passer imo
@M_V_Beard @miigueelb_ @__sportschief @westbrookpg13sz @ldaoming @JohanBackkV2 @BULLETlN Ur jokes mate. Who has a ring? CP3 is still really good but kyrie is in his prime and CP isn’t as good as he once was. Westbrook is nothing on kyrie as he takes awful shots. And Steph isn’t clutch. There’s an argument to say that none of them are better but it’s an opinion
@DaveyP192 @xSamuelSzx @JuventusBelgium @SkySportsNews @Cristiano Looks like that trim doesn’t serve ur opinions well. There’s no way u can watch messi and think anyone is better. It’s not even close
@miigueelb_ @M_V_Beard @__sportschief @westbrookpg13sz @ldaoming @JohanBackkV2 @BULLETlN Which 2 are better then
@FulhamDan @FulhamFC Yeah but those injuries don’t make him tell his team to just attack and play a high line against an attacking force like Arsenal. He does himself no favours
@CaesarMS7 @coystimothy @OfficialFPL Jorginho captain?🤦🏾‍♂️🤣 u been on that good shit😂🤔

@Alan0Jones @FulhamFC Yeah I understand it’s not his style but wolves have changed to a more defensive style and they look like a top 7 side imo
@ketone599 @rmctiesport @Habib_Starboi @OfficialFPL Na that’s reasonable. Arsenal are still shit at the back

@MrDtAFC @Aubameyang7 @LacazetteAlex Fair play for not dropping ur phone😂
@FulhamFC I’m no Fulham fan and u lot probably know more but I think this is on the manager. He’s constantly changing the defence and sets out to concede. He needs to realise u don’t have players like city and Liverpool so can’t just go all out, especially against Arsenal

@JoMouFC @Vintage_Utd Just cos his team might not have won finals, how does that instantly mean it makes him the bottler. At the end of the day, the players are the ones out there so his team have been bottlers if anything

@Jubhamba @aceseddy What a disastrous tweet
@ryanoconnor05 @celtics I agree. Thankfully he’s not gonna be part of the bench rotation but yeah I don’t think he offers that much as of now
@AvidAnder @FourFourJordan Herrera is fucking shit and inconsistent and offers no protection. Pereira is understandable but matic should always start, unless he’s really been shit which he hasn’t. He’s just been average
@ginormocunt @Douglas17988782 @AddyNas13 No this shit system and average inconsistent players around him is a huge part of why he’s struggling. Who can he link up with in that team? It’s shit. U don’t just lose ur talent after signing for a new team. Fake cunt fans like u don’t help when cheering when he comes off
@RealistYahz @MourinhoMindset Init, I don’t get how people don’t see it. Don’t get me wrong he has been poor with giving the ball away etc but what can he do when he’s in a shit system with players that can’t do link up play. U can see he’s lacking any confidence.

@gordonhayward @PlayersTribune @TheAthletic Let’s get it☘️☘️
@cxmthfc Don’t think I’ve ever agreed with a tweet more. So many things wrong I’m not gonna name half of them. Driven shots = 🗑. Passing and build up play is impossible when it’s so slow paced so the AI just intercept and tackle so easily
@alp27 @JPizzleFIFA I guess u have completely different gameplay to me cos if u had my gameplay and said it was good then I’d send for some serious help for u. Don’t u feel the gameplay is slow and clunky. It’s impossible to create chances when by the time you’ve made a pass, they’ve read it
@OllieBrinkworth @Louisburns7 @ZameerKhAn08 @TwoSyncOfficial Init. Can’t believe people like the gameplay
@Louisburns7 @ZameerKhAn08 @TwoSyncOfficial No the whole point was to improve the game and add new stuff but all it’s done is ruin it and feels more like pes
@Griezmannility @suckyourmumlnit He’s gonna be 23
@TwoSyncOfficial What are people’s thoughts on the gameplay? For me it’s so slow and clunky which makes it impossible to create chances
@Fatherxh @PassTheSaIt What an embarrassing tweet. So much wrong with it that I’m not even gonna explain. On ur 🚲 u fish
@Fatherxh @PassTheSaIt More like u know I’m right so u bring my avi into it. Hard to take someone seriously when they don’t rate a baller like shaw let alone vertonghen. U have a fuckin fish as ur avi so bye bye u twat
@Fatherxh @PassTheSaIt Having 2 top centre backs and hazza can only get them so far u melt. There are 8 other positions and a bench On your 🚲 pal✋🏾✊🏾
@Fatherxh @PassTheSaIt Imagine not rating vertonghen🤣 ur either an arsenal fan or a deluded tosser. Or both
@AllezFutbol Fair do’s but I’m no mind reader pal. I’m sure half the people that liked it think ur being serious
@SkeptaStormzy @zacparkes_ @El_colombiano10 @MattHDGamer Why do u have to let go of RT
@NBATV @KingJames Did look like a travel to be fair. But cos it’s bron they probably think he’s so good that he doesn’t travel
@zacparkes_ @El_colombiano10 @MattHDGamer Shit, yeah that’s so obvious and I didn’t even think of that😂🤣 cheers mate. The gameplay is still slow and clunky imo. I’m guessing Matt and others who like it have different gameplay to me cos mine is horrible
@zacparkes_ @El_colombiano10 @MattHDGamer It didn’t ruin Fifa 18 at all. It just meant there was more emphasis placed on how good u r defensively. I suppose that’s easy to say when I got 39-1. I’ve seen many people complain about driven shots. Ur telling me u don’t accidentally chip it instead of it doing a driven shot?
@El_colombiano10 @MattHDGamer Yeah it’s so slow for me aswell. So hard to split a defence open when they’re passing at 1 mph. They’ve ruined driven shots aswell. Why tf do u have to press lb, rb and b for it. In the heat of the moment it’s impossible to do a driven shot cos it just fucks up by chipping it
@AllezFutbol The fact that he’s robbed someone before makes him a tosser that deserves no respect. Fuck the “respect bro” mate🤦🏾‍♂️

@bulletproofviDz @Emirhanakt @OfficialFPL Benching Robertson is more understandable but I was saying to the other lad that u never bench Alonso u sad tosser. Hard to take u calling me a melt seriously when ur called bulletproofviDz🤔🤷🏾‍♂️
@bulletproofviDz @Emirhanakt @OfficialFPL Yeah it’s all well and good saying it when they get 2 points
@bulletproofviDz @Emirhanakt @OfficialFPL Naa benching a premium defender is a no go pal
@Emirhanakt @OfficialFPL Imagine benching alonso
@NBA @Timberwolves @NBATV Man I can’t explain how much I wanna see him back at his best
@TwoSyncOfficial Totally agree. I went on kick off to practice and half of the “great timing” shots went over. So I’ve just turned it off
@suckyourmumlnit Init. Looks like he wants to end someone but top class
@OfficialFPL Yes trips
@suckyourmumlnit Ur lucky ur at work instead of watching that shit show of a half
@Flex_Mufc @Chaelesy @OsmanRiaz98 @ManUtd @Ibra_official No we don’t play to his strengths. Go and take a look back on his Everton goals and then tell me we play to his strengths. It also doesn’t help when quite a few teams park the bus so he has barely any space
@Flex_Mufc @Chaelesy @OsmanRiaz98 @ManUtd @Ibra_official I agree with all of that but he’d give much more if we actually knew what a cross was. Rashford doesn’t often get into good positions so u can’t judge his finishing really
@Flex_Mufc @Chaelesy @OsmanRiaz98 @ManUtd @Ibra_official But Rom offers so much more, especially when u play to his strengths, which we can’t do cos we aren’t consistently putting crosses in. There’s a reason he’s got 100+ pl goals at only 25
@Chaelesy @OsmanRiaz98 @ManUtd @Ibra_official He said world class mate. Right now rashford is playing like he belongs in the U21’s
@myfootballtrial @UnitedRxn @utdxtra Have u seen the definition of a fanboy u dick head? Backing a world class player isn’t a fanboy🤔
@jerj24 @celtics It’s just the brain dead people that think winning in pre season is more important than things like minutes for each player
@yuriheifen @celtics U just said why’s he taking them out🤦🏾‍♂️ that’s why they’re far off 35 minutes. Are u actually brain dead or what
@KawhiLeonardSZN @celtics Yeah it’s gonna be a tough season for the raptors. Even without Lebronto it’s still gonna be tough for u lot to get past teams like the C’s, philly, wizards and pacers
@yuriheifen @celtics It’s called balancing the minutes u tool. First game of the pre season, he’s not gonna get guys like Hayward or kyrie who haven’t played for ages play 35+.
@UnitedRxn @utdxtra You’re repping Memphis who’s best moment for Man Utd was when Lyon beat city ffs
@UnitedRxn @utdxtra Why don’t u back the geezer? Yes he’s been shit but it’s not his fault rom’s first touch is a long range diag and the rest of the players aren’t on the same page. U don’t just go shit, days after leaving for another team

@MesutAssist97 @jamielewis21 @billy23411 @JackIngarfill @MrDtAFC @UnitedStandMUFC Been to a few games pal. Even if I hadn’t been to any, who gives a fuck when I don’t take it as seriously as u seem to. More important things in life than going to games u nonce
@MesutAssist97 @jamielewis21 @billy23411 @JackIngarfill @MrDtAFC @UnitedStandMUFC “Trying to defend your whole team”🤔 no pal I know we are shit but arsenal in good form are just as bad if not worse. My Sunday league team could cause problems for that defence. Pipe down mesutassist
@WacaLaca9 @MesutAssist97 @JackIngarfill @MrDtAFC @UnitedStandMUFC How jokes. I’ll join in at laughing at United. 😂😂😂 I know we’re shit but deluded fans like u can’t admit that their own team are wank
@jamielewis21 @MesutAssist97 @billy23411 @JackIngarfill @MrDtAFC @UnitedStandMUFC We’re wasting our time pal. I’ve realised that anyone who defends a player as shit as ozil is shouldn’t get a response. I think it’s actually embarrassing trynna defend someone who doesn’t even look like he enjoys the game of football tbh
@MesutAssist97 @WacaLaca9 @JackIngarfill @MrDtAFC @UnitedStandMUFC Oh shit did matic and pogba die. Pogba has been dog shit and has still had a more positive impact than both of those shit houses. Even Fred and fellaini have been better. If u don’t agree then it sums up y u rep a player as washed as ozil
@MesutAssist97 @jamielewis21 @billy23411 @JackIngarfill @MrDtAFC @UnitedStandMUFC Remind me, when was the last time ozil put in a few quality performances in consistently, or turned up in a big game, whether that’s against one of the top 6 or a crucial game. Nope, u can’t cos he is a bottle job
@MesutAssist97 @WacaLaca9 @JackIngarfill @MrDtAFC @UnitedStandMUFC “On the up”🤣🤷🏾‍♂️ have u seen some of Arsenal’s performances? Outplayed by the likes of Everton and West Ham. Top 7 will be an achievement this season for u lot. Wolves will defo finish higher pal. Enjoy Europa nights for the upcoming seasons👍🏾✊🏾

@MesutAssist97 @WacaLaca9 @JackIngarfill @MrDtAFC @UnitedStandMUFC Mate this will probably be arsenal’s best season in 10 years and you’ll probably still finish behind us in what looks like it’s gonna be one of our worst seasons in a while. Ur team starts Granit Xhaka and mesut ozil... not much more to say pal
@MesutAssist97 @JackIngarfill @MrDtAFC @UnitedStandMUFC Believe me it’s not more embarrassing. Ozil is absolutely finished. Doesn’t even look like he wants to be playing football. Zero passion and effort. No reaction when a teammate scores. In it for himself and when it’s going tits up, which is 99% of the time then he’s even shitter
@WacaLaca9 @Bob50348974 @JackIngarfill @MrDtAFC @UnitedStandMUFC Ur laughing like he’s flopped and is shit. He’s had numerous injuries u spanner. Wait till he’s consistently playing. U wouldn’t know tho cos u probably only watch Arsenal, if that

@Greatness_00 @NBA2K_MyTEAM Ur saying it like it requires so much time and effort. I see ur point but if things like the servers were on point then there’d be less complaining
@Greatness_00 @NBA2K_MyTEAM I don’t think half the people would complain if the servers weren’t fucking shit. Went 11-1 on MTU and my only loss was a dc because of the servers. Now it’s even worse where it’s happening every few games. That’s the least they can do

@SkyBetHelp I’ve been refunded. Cheers
@SkyBetHelp I put a £3.50 bet on and all but an offside happened in the first 10 minutes so how long does it take for the money to be given back?
@SkyBetHelp Ok, cheers. Most likely yeah👍🏾
@SkyBetHelp Ah ok so if I chose the second bet on the pictures sent, then it means I’d get my money back if for example, there isn’t an offside in the first 10 minutes but there is a throw in, corner and a foul?
@SkyBetHelp But does that mean it’s a free bet? Could u give me an example please?

Why do u think even most Arsenal fans (with a brain, which u don’t) think he’s shit. Appalling of a response that, guessing that I don’t watch ur team😂✊🏾
@EraOfEmery @MUFCCathal He’d be a shit winger🤣🤣 can’t dribble, weak and scared of going forward. No shooting or crossing accurately in the air ability. Joke of a rep😂
@kamins11 @isaiahthomas When will fools like u learn, don’t believe everything u read. U didn’t know him personally and weren’t around him when this supposedly happened
@JakeSil1 @UniqueRiggers *In 8 years of football
@JakeSil1 @UniqueRiggers That doesn’t make him better ffs. CR7 got in ahead of messi. Think we know who’s better. Also, that was Salah’s first world class season about 8 years of football. Come back when he’s been as consistent as modric, Ronaldo and Isco
@JakeSil1 @UniqueRiggers How stupid do u have to be to think Isco isn’t the better player. Salah is the better goal scorer. Apart from that, Isco is better in every department. If u think otherwise then u have been diagnosed with delusion son. If u were a RM fan, ur telling me u would say Mo is better?🤣
@JakeSil1 @UniqueRiggers Isco is a class above salah. It’s not all about goals. Stop with the bias and delusion pal.
@usopen @delpotrojuan Top role model and absolute class person and player. He will win at least 1 more slam,  I’m sure🙌🏾🤙🏾
@aroman23 @_superrsonic @SilvinhaChicago @maswibilili No matter how many more goals ronaldo gets than messi, he should never be classed as better. For messi to put up the numbers that he does as not even a striker is out of this world. And for how special he is at what he does, no one will ever surpass him. There’s no comparison
@EraOfEmery @MUFCCathal U rep one of the worst and most inept full backs we might ever see🤷🏾‍♂️ can’t believe people even rated him in the first place. He literally offers nothing more often than not. Could see from ages back that he’s all hype. No defensive brain, can’t cross in the air accurately

@djcampas @usopen At the end of the day, u should be blaming Serena’s coach as, if he knew the rules, none of this shit woulda happened. Also, all Serena had to do was accept the CV and carry on. The combination of the umpire, Serena and her coach ruined Osaka’s moment
@gwanlad @anthony420xx @grantrigz @ClassicLukaku @DalotEra @LukeShaw23 Jesus Christ, bailly and rojo is like leaving 2 angry dogs on their own. It’s just asking for trouble. As much stick as smalling gets, he is first choice easily imo. Not great but the most reliable

@mufasa_gooner @MrDtAFC Man said “You can’t be asking him this”🤣😭🤔 Why can’t I ask him u melt. That’s the whole point of a Q&amp;A u spanner. I’m asking him if he thinks he will get many starts with those 2 in the team. I’m not asking him to read the gaffer’s mind pal👍🏾
@MrDtAFC Do you see a regular spot in the starting XI for mkhitaryan when Laca and Auba start together?

@PLFootyandNews @StevieA92 @ben4589 @SkySportsPL https://t.co/MINJSBQoFm
@lufc160392 @UniqueRiggers Yeah, but I doubt his in game stats for short passing is 63. It’s probably stuff like curve that makes it as low as 63
@lufc160392 @UniqueRiggers Means nothing when half of their passes are from side to side to get an attack going. Not saying he’s shit at passing cos he is good with the ball but u don’t base it on pass completion %

@kop44_ @ldabbs89 @Super6 @GNev2 @ManUtd @paulpogba If your brain functioned properly then you wouldn’t call it babysitting. First off I always get pissed at him and I know he’s got a lot to improve.

@kop44_ @ldabbs89 @Super6 @GNev2 @ManUtd @paulpogba He wasn’t bought to do the dirty work, which is why we signed matic. He can’t play in a 2 cos he has no defensive discipline, which leaves matic exposed, mainly in away games. So him and pogba need a 3rd mid so they can both be consistently at their best.
