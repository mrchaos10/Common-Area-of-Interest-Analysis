@GotoGrow_London #meetthementor Absolute pleasure.  Thanks for the invitation...
@GotoGrow_London #meetthementor You'll succeed overseas with an intentional plan, feeding it with realistic budgets, not as an experiment.
@Taylok19 @chelskilad #meetthementor Average PR budgets in US higher than UK.  Belief in the ROI of Marketing which isn't as true in the UK.
@OhThatAndyKing #meetthementor Not at all. The hurdle is their thinking and assumption of failure abroad rather than success.
@GotoGrow_London #meetthementor Definitely since they know the market and what does(n't) resonate. Also US English very different to UK...
@Druien #meetthementor Localisation is critical, &amp; best done BEFORE you start business overseas. You only get 1 chance to prove relevance...
@GotoGrow_London #meetthementor There ARE US regional differences in terms of formality, pace, directness at least.  Time there reveals all.
@socialfaerie #meetthementor Via @GotoGrow_London networks, trade asssociations, industry watchers/analysts...
@Sth_London_Girl #meetthementor definitely shared! Keeps you glued together, talking, exchanging ideas, innovating, on the same path...
@GotoGrow_London #meetthementor Frequent calls/visits, interaction with the UK team.  Also clarity on what that #businessculture should be.
@hyperchris #meetthementor Carefully. Start very focused and go from there.  Many overstretch which is their undoing.  Be laser-like.
@SVC2UK #meetthementor Key you create a US presence (office, tel, incorporation) so they know you're there for a while. Also ROI &amp; payback.
@chelskilad #meetthementor depends on the product/service.  The media mix needs to match the target audience. US uses PR more than UK...
@OhThatAndyKing #meetthementor innovation, leadership talent, ability to scale...
@missfuell #meetthementor Approach it as an experiment, think small, don't allocate enough budget, don't make it part of their biz strategy.
@GotoGrow_London #meetthementor So many to choose from! @Pret, @jennypackham, @Topshop, @SpaceNKusa ... did the research and listened to it!
@Sth_London_Girl #meetthementor Just the opposite. Biz relationships formed by doing deals, then the personal follows.
@L_Pbusiness #meetthementor At first, 70% local/30% expat then migrate in the other direction. Need to transfer the ideas, culture/values...
@d_rosamilia #meetthementor get them to the UK to see how you do it here, get them onboard on your culture/values.  Spend time with them...
@SVC2UK #meetthementor start with the customer problem you solve, then talk numbers.  Keep the backstory for the end if there's interest.
@L_Pbusiness #meetthementor going to those overseas markets to immerse in them, stay a while, observe first-hand.  No short-cuts for that...
@RachelHearne1 #meetthementor US: new &amp; bigger = better, action, participation &gt; observing, customer service = key. UK: sceptical, honest...
@London_CVB #meetthementor creative, humble, a bit risk-averse, global awareness, diplomatic, indirect, innovative, occasionally passive...
@L_Pbusiness #meetthementor absolutely! Makes you stand out, but choose British the characteristics carefully.  "Traditional" AND "Modern."
@Sth_London_Girl #meetthementor communicate regularly, lots of praise/recognition, clarity of goals, make assumptions clear...
@d_rosamilia #meetthementor do both! That way each learns from the other...
@Sth_London_Girl #meetthementor since job security is so low there, keeping people inspired/motivated is key so they don't defect...
@socialfaerie #meetthementor lived in Germany as a child and appreciate European culture, values, being understood, geography knowledge...
