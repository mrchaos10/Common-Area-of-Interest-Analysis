@schofeld @Cybrsalon The difference is not just in level of factual reporting (World Seevice spends more time on a story, that helps) but also the stories' angles often differ from the domestic line - I think they know they can't get away with the stuff they serve up domestically.
@Cybrsalon AFAICS in many areas of dispute a lot of the "consensus" about fact vs. fiction is belief, based on unclear data, for partisan benefit - which is why it all changes every few years. I prefer the scientific method of definining facts, but it seems deeply unfashionable these days.
@schofeld The biggest critique I have of the BBC reporting-wise is the domestic stuff is dumbed down and far too emote-heavy and data-free. Listening to the World Service is like listening to a different broadcaster cc @Cybrsalon
@Cybrsalon Ah, but I have the same criticism of what is a "fact" - IMO far too many areas today are trying to call their supposition "facts" and the other sides' a heresy, whereas often it's differing interpretations of an unclear dataset.

@amywebb @samwmarks In the 1930's, anger swung people away from an Elite that was perceived by the "deplorables" as not helping them/sitting on its hands, and towards "anyone* offering a solution. In many countries there was a battle between Fascists and Communists to be the the new choice.
@amywebb This prioritizing anger over analysis has been going on awhile (forever arguably) but the "emotion trumps reason" problem has been seen as a major problem on social media for a least a decade, so no surprise we now live in a Flame War world

@charlesarthur @RicoS90 I don't know, what interested me booth in the US and the UK at the time it was learly a problem with small kids I could see little interest in the problem and that is pretty much the case now afaics
@charlesarthur @RicoS90 I'd go back to root cause i.e. what is being done differently today, maybe compare with pop'ns where it isn't happening, and try to remove this at source rather than cvaccinate against bad practice, I'd bet what is causing this is also driving other child rearing issues
@charlesarthur I saw it when  lived in US and my kids were small, every 2nd child seemed to have an allergy of some sort, and abt 10 yrs ago in UK the "no nuts at school" panic really kicked in and in both cases no-one seemed to see this as a problem!

@Frances_Coppola Let's revisit in 3 years, I reckon I'm reading the runes correctly.
@swardley It would be taking sides, which would be suicide  (ditto all the pressure by Remainers on Labour for all sorts of intercessions).
@Frances_Coppola Not break up (immediately anyway), but IMO a serious fracture/ factionalisation and internal  conflict is very plausible, there are big forces at play now within various bits of the EU.
@Frances_Coppola They are definitely playing chicken, the difference though is this time the EU can also get badly hurt in the crash. It is (IMO) far more vulnerable to fragmentation on impact than it looks https://t.co/LnsEyHv6OT

@Frances_Coppola Yes, very odd and high risk to rallyers I'd've thought! Any thoughts on how these rallies happen apart from truly irrational exuberance?
@karinjr TBH I think Sweden has done what Germany, Holland, UK, US, Austria, Italy seem to not have - my left of centre twtsteam is grokking that the trend right is here to stay (though its been evident for 5 years at least.). Sobering up from an incapacitated state is a very apt term.
@Frances_Coppola I've also seen the same, I can't satisfactorily explain the rallies though. The Friday thing is intresting.

Brexit has driven a civil war in both parties, while Labour is also having a Blairite/Corbynite civil war. Also, continual vitriolic attacks from the UK media on Labour don't help https://t.co/rh1ScBrocP
As predicted, the result saw record growth of the right and a large drop in centre left vote share, and the "shocked" reactions begin to a trend that has swept the OECD and has been clear for 10 years. I guess it's because the politically naive thought "Sweden was Different".
@Frances_Coppola @toadmeister I wouldn't hold your breath for a response, that's not how it works. Seems to me thought, that there is easily enough empirical evidence that Academia in certain "ologies" increasingly resembles the pre-Renaissance church in its attempts to suppress unwelcome news.
@mediaczar Odds on the next wave of hipsters bringing them back in. Why display your superiority with such invisible things as 3 temperature kettles when there are ties?
@Frances_Coppola @toadmeister IMO you don't have ulterior motives in general, I find your thinking very incisive and you're not scared to call a spade exactly what it is. Thus I was a bit surprised by your approach to this one, it seemed to me you called it but were searching for reasons to absolve.
@r_c I agree, my point was more that their core skill is transport via aircraft, not making money from data manipulation so they are more vulnerable. GDPR could have unforseen consequences if huge fines put non-expert data handlers out of business.
@Frances_Coppola @toadmeister I did, reads to me like "how can I excuse people I like from malfeasance thats been called out by people I don't like". Same withh Breitbart &amp; Cologne, liberals spent 90% of their time shooting the messenger.
@Frances_Coppola @toadmeister None of this changes the main isue, that there is clearly something rotten in the state of Academia (and collusion in other media fonr not reporting it). Reminds me of ppl criticizing Breitbart when it broke the Cologne assault stories

@TomRaftery But you then have to believe that Air Taxis will work out cheaper because another industry *may* get energy costs down to near zero at some point in the future, (never mind having good enough AI). That is a long, long way from the blithe assertions in the Graun article.
@synapticity It's just that one is such obvious "fake news" - and the MSM wonders why no one trusts it anymore?
@TomRaftery Cost of flight vs land travel is not due to manufacturing issues like HDs were, but due to gravity. Whatever the cost of pushing a mass along a road is, flying it will always be very much higher because it will take far more energy. It can only be cheap if energy is near-free.
@TomRaftery Same benefits apply to taxicars, and will come sooner - EAVs on a road will be far more advanced by the time EAVs in the air are safe. Plus, the  laws of physics can't be paid off with SV hype. This is a high energy, high cost option for high value uses or rich ppl
@TomRaftery Short hops have even worse economics, the huge cost is gettig into the air and down again, moving along it is (relatively) low cost. It's why there are no helitaxis today except at very high price. These will be for the rich, there is no way they "could" be cheaper than an Uber
@TomRaftery Lifting and moving a mass *safely* in the air takes a lot more resources than pushing it along a road and so costs a *lot* more. That's why trucks still haul freight long distances, why China is building the Silk Road and why only very rich ppl have private 'planes or helos.

@mediaczar @RadioFreeTom You're right, the Brits esp are famous for distrusting "boffins" - but fwiw when we were tracking Brexit than anger over the Remain "experts" lecturing + Project Fear IMO was what did them the most damage (or a major contributor anyway)

@mediaczar Fwiw I grew up in exactly the same climate in SA, veld fires are an everyday occurrence in the dry summers, and they always were and will be. CA is doing the dry climate equivalent of building housing estates on flood plains

@Frances_Coppola @FlipChartRick @CashQuestions Have you read "Travellers in the Third Reich" yet? Very detailed insights about the causes of populism &amp; /Hitler's rise (and of course the book's arrival itself is a symptom of our times).
@joannejacobs True - such an inefficient implementation, would work far better w/out blockchain overheads
@mediaczar I think the issue is the optics. Big picture is If these Co's had stepped up and paid tax previously, if HMG had made more of an effort to shake them down previously, if rich ppl were not known for tax evasion etc, and ave ppl were not getting poorer it wld all be OK.
@mediaczar If Amazon (and other US Tech Co's) earnings were a little bit more transparent you'd have a point, but they have a certain reknown for playing 3 cup shuffle tricks with taxable revenues.

@vaughandavies @BBCr4today @RachelReevesMP That's not how the maths works though. Stuffing women into the (few) well paid roles has minimal impact if the majority of lower paid workers are female, as the big driver is No. of ppl, not salary. Only solution is far more males at lowest levels (Salesfloor, checkouts etc).
@gavinesler They are hidingbwho funds them - now why would that be....

@CondelynneLynne @GeorgeMonbiot I'd make sure I had the counterfactual before asserting the referendum was stolen, in the current environment.  IMO the argument re the danger of Dark Money is correct, but assuming that only "people I don't like" use it is naive, partisan and diminishes it.

@ValoisDuBins @JulieOwenMoylan @herdmeister I'm assuming nothing abt Brexit one way or the other, I am more interested in their claimed current economics.
@ValoisDuBins @JulieOwenMoylan @herdmeister Of course they are a succesful carmaker, that's that point - which is why I don't believe their margin claim.
@ValoisDuBins @JulieOwenMoylan @herdmeister Honda clearly do know what they are doing, from that article. BTW it's also clear from that article that Honda are not running on the wafer thin margins Nissan claims it is running at.
@ValoisDuBins @JulieOwenMoylan @herdmeister I am making no assumptions about this at all. I am assuming that what they said - 6 minutes stoppage in 23 hours makes them unprofitable - was what they meant. If they really meant far more time then they should say that, would make more sense TBH
@ValoisDuBins @JulieOwenMoylan @herdmeister They said it was 6 minutes stoppage in 23 hours that put them into loss, not 6 minutes + X more hours run up stoppage. If they meant a far longer stoppage time they should have said - it would make far more sense btw - but of course it dilutes their "Doom" spiel

Frustrated with Nigeria, they look dangerous when they attack but are sitting in uncomfortable defence and have paid for it
@ValoisDuBins @JulieOwenMoylan @herdmeister This is wrong - 6 minutes lost in 3 hours is c 97% uptime, 6 minutes in 23 hours (the original article claim)  is 99.7% uptime. That is near miraculous uptime for a complex manufacturing operation.
@ValoisDuBins @JulieOwenMoylan @herdmeister Fwiw I'd bet that margin is based on corporate internal transfer costs to minimise carefully calculated to minimise tax paid in the UK
@ValoisDuBins @JulieOwenMoylan @herdmeister Constantly - I'm a consultant! - But I've been doing JiT/0 Inventory work as well as corporate turnarounds for decades, and a business with 0.4% margins (6 mins/23 hrs) is non viable unless there are undisclosed bungs or bunce
@JulieOwenMoylan @herdmeister @ValoisDuBins Those aren't margins, that is a non viable business unless its being subsidised or it's internal transfer cost or there is some form of upstream margin

@schofeld @ftrain IMO the question is how many types of transaction in the world are valuable enough to pay for its crypto overheads, low volume enough to work, and actually need the functionality vs a cheaper approach. Right now it feels like dotcomland, the dreams are &gt;&gt; delivery ability 2/2
@schofeld @ftrain Yes pretty much - bubbletime. Fwiw I did some analysis on various blockchain methods' algorithms and estimated their economics from that. Right now there cheaper "good enoughs" for many of their proposed uses, and a limited number of uses with value &gt;&gt; transaction costs. 1/2
To clarify, I am a "bounded sceptic" :D - in that I think blockchain has its place but it is totally overhyped in range and level of impact - today it is a slow speed, high cost transaction system and will only work in areas where its benefits outweigh these costs. https://t.co/Nw4vyNtQyW
@ZoeSumra What is interesting is despite the "loner" frontier/wild west popular culture, European (and very prob Amerindian for that matter), settlement of the US was typically only sustained when it was highly communal and collaborative.

@helenium Everybody who moves to another country goes through this phase, and then it's all assimilated , and 3 yrs later when you go "home" it all seems so quaint :).
@ZoeSumra Have you noticed so much US Dystopian SciFi is the "loner hero (with followers maybe)" model whereas UK tends to be a race for/to salvation via some sort of community. IMO it's because one place has a village about every few miles and the other only every few hours driving

@loudmouthman The timetable has been irrelevant on Southern Rail and Thameslink for a few years, I increasingly just find myself adding a 1/2 hour to a journey time of 20 mins and just pitching up at the station then and catch whatever late train rocks up first

We used to have 4 Southern Rail trains an hour, roughly every 15 minutes or so, from London Bridge to our station. We still have 4 - but 2 leave within 3 mins of each other every 1/2 hour.

Clangers!! https://t.co/R01TTcj1iQ
@OrinHite @Frances_Coppola @coindesk @izakaminska @cjenscook @JOMICHELL @dinisguarda We study the blockchain more as an economic/business tool, IMO the evidence implies there are many "good enoughs/much cheapers" it has to contend with in order to replace many existing systems. I have no idea what will happen to Bitcoins but the energy and time drain is bad news
@OrinHite @Frances_Coppola @coindesk @izakaminska @cjenscook @JOMICHELL We ran an event last year on this, @dinisguarda gave a presentation, his hypothesis is that corporates/entities will set up their own "walled" blockchains for closed verticals - far lower distb'n nodes and hash calcs req'd. Less secure if breached, but better performance.
@OrinHite @Frances_Coppola @coindesk @izakaminska @cjenscook @JOMICHELL That's kinda my point - it has to find a new approach that is either or both of less internally secure and less distributed.. Whether Bitcoin forks its way out or is superseded by a 2nd Gen cryptocurrency approach is anyone's guess right now.
@Frances_Coppola @coindesk @izakaminska @cjenscook @JOMICHELL Or run out of global electricity supply first :)
@Frances_Coppola @coindesk @izakaminska @cjenscook @JOMICHELL The Bitcoin blockchain uses a fully meshed network so op costs rise by the square of nodes/transactions. It's also a very high cost/time lag system owing to the complex hashing calcs. There are only 2 ways out - less complex (ie less secure) calcs or a non-fully meshed network

@BenedictEvans What's the reduction in car parts overall though? Moving parts are but a small % of all car parts, a 5-10x reduction in parts in the whole supply chain would entail far more than just moving parts.
