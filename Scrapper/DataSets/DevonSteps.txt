This’s what @NPP_GH National Women organizer has for Ghanaians. https://t.co/YVnyFkmUj8
@myfootballtrial @ManUtdChannel @moutune I can’t talk for the other guys cos I don’t follow them that much But I know sarri got his midfield target Jorginho. His 1st choice midfielder. But what was given Jose?That’s the issue! Get him his 1st choice players then you have the right to criticize him when he doesn’t do it
@myfootballtrial @ManUtdChannel @moutune Jorginho doesn’t play doe utd sir! Sanchez has been playing shit since he came &amp; that’s not the managers fault bro!
@JaySpearingFC @utdxtra @michaelowen He gave him the chance to take &amp; he didn’t take it. Look at it from that angle!
@JaySpearingFC @utdxtra @michaelowen Yh. But he started him! Or it doesn’t count huh?
@myfootballtrial @ManUtdChannel @moutune It’s not about errors here. It’s about the backing. There’s no need keeping Jose if you can’t back him in the transfer market. Dude spent the whole summer complaining about his defensive options but what did the club do about it?? Absolutely nothing!
@myfootballtrial @ManUtdChannel @moutune He gives options of 4 in every position. The clubs gets him what they want! Like Matic, he wanted Dier but he was given Matic. Is that his fault?? C’mon. The club should be getting the manager his A list players. His first choice players! That’s no fault of Jose
@JaySpearingFC @utdxtra @michaelowen Rarely?? He played against Valencia on Wednesday mate. Pls come again! I’m sure his match day starts are even more than that of Fabinho!
@IngKwabz @utdxtra @michaelowen @GNev2 You bab. That’s what the utd fans want
@JaySpearingFC @utdxtra @michaelowen For how long has he been sitting on the bench before the game yesterday?

@IngKwabz @utdxtra @michaelowen @GNev2 I’m tired of The scapegoating. Jose should go &amp; let these guys get in the manager of their choice let’s see if it’ll work out. Abi it’s nice football they want? They should go get the “right” manager for the club!
Haven’t you done enough already?Just stop,stop! You’re disgracing the country with your hatred for Nkrumah! At least let some other nationals make these suggestions or let other nationals do this shameful &amp; needless bidding for you. At least if you wanna do this be smart about it
@ManUtdChannel @moutune Only sense I’ve seen so far
@NAkufoAddo what did Kwame Nkrumah do wrong? Why do you want to wipe away the memories of this man? You’ve moved your shame from the boundaries of your country to the AU. Why Nana? Why?? You’re hell bent on tarnishing the image &amp; discrediting this man. Why’s that so? Why?
@IngKwabz @utdxtra @michaelowen Lol, these ex footballers feel they know everything in football but in actual sense they know shit. So far only @GNev2 speaks some sense &amp; is honest as well. The rest are just a bunch of bs &amp; haters on an agenda against Jose! Club doesn’t support manager &amp; you think the man bad
