@Paul5Robbo he's no Kenny Jackett.
@rioferdy5 Messi not winning the world cup will always be a point brought up when discussing the best player ever.
@accordingtoaldo calling players by their first names just to let everyone know he knows them.
@rioferdy5 he knows his football but he should stick to being a pundit. So boring! #whereisthemutebutton
