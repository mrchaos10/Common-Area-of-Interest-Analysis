@goldenspartan08 @Box_Off_India Congratulations #uri for striking  manikarnika hard upon being in 4th week with lesser screen count n low budget😂😂
@demigod076 @Box_Off_India Its because of the huge budget that she got 3000+ screen count n no actress has ever got this screen before, yet manikarnika flops.
@Box_Off_India Disaster  queen. The string of her flop continues.  She is just lucky Friday release wasn't  that big, she would  have smell pepper more than this. Its flop anyway.

@sangeetakarthik @vishwatosh4 @amaresh2212 @taran_adarsh He thinks talent alone takes one far. Kangana  lack of humility  n arrogant  is what has caused  her down fall. Deepika may not b that great  actress, but her humble nature is what took her this far.

@vishwatosh4 @sangeetakarthik @amaresh2212 @taran_adarsh Yet, she is dying  to have them n fighting  with Hrithik in media just to get the EX tag which is so impossible  to her than her bought National award😂😂
@vishwatosh4 @sangeetakarthik @amaresh2212 @taran_adarsh What she is today? She is only known to be controversial queen  whom everyone  is disassociating themselves from. She has become a jinx

@vishwatosh4 @sangeetakarthik @amaresh2212 @taran_adarsh Yh, Deepika got through Farhan n kangaroo got through Aditya Pancholi. At least, Ranbir was her boyfriend  then n DP   didn't  stalk n send nude pictures to him to b love. That's  the difference .
@vishwatosh4 @sangeetakarthik @amaresh2212 @taran_adarsh But she she took Aditya  help  to get foot in Bollywood n none of the khans nor the kumara r even dying  to b casted opposite her cause she doesn't  have the aura of super star.

@sangeetakarthik @Bitterati_91 @antifragile123 @apurvnagpal They think they can fool us whiles producers  n distributors r  crying inside. Before  the movie released   they were eyeing 200cr+  cause they know the budget was 125cr😂. Now they reduced it to make themselves happy.😁

@sangeetakarthik @vishwatosh4 @amaresh2212 @taran_adarsh N even boast of being married  men mistress. Later she comes with women should support  women. She was with Aditya Pancholi for good 5yrs knowing he is a married  man just to get into Bollywood. Isn't  the same woman she hurt? This lady can kill 2 get what she wants.
@vishwatosh4 @sangeetakarthik @amaresh2212 @taran_adarsh It's rather her lost cause she has caused a lot of loss to producers n distributors. Which they will think  twice before casting her. What is the essence of being a good actress with no footfall at the box office?
@vishwatosh4 @sangeetakarthik @amaresh2212 @taran_adarsh Ide rather watch Raki sawant Interview than wasting my hard earn money on this arrogant n thief actress who has no remorse in stealing people's credit. Yes, I used 2 stan her but not anymore. 4yrs ago, I was among those promotin TWMR thinkin she was a gud human, but not anymore
@vishwatosh4 @amaresh2212 @taran_adarsh Aren't u people tired of using the nepo tactics everywhere. At least, they snatched their butter n bread but didn't  break people's  marriage  n STEAL directors n writers credit.
@AmitSha63610980 @taran_adarsh She deserves  it. When she used to be humble n coexist with everyone  during TWMR days, everything  was smoothly for her. After the success of that movie, she thinks she is above everyone.

Manikarnika is super F.L.O.P. and no amount of reducing its budget will make it EVEN average.
@Bitterati_91 @antifragile123 @apurvnagpal Manikarnika is not 90, its 120cr+. The 3000+ screen  flopnikarnika got should tel u the budget is above 120cr+. Because u people see it flopping, u decide 2 reduce the budget 2 make yourself happy😂. How on earth wil kangana get such huge release if not because of the budget
@Amitpandey20699 @apurvnagpal She is not great actress nor big actress, not even in top 10😂.she just overhyped  herself by taking on big names in Bollywood  to stay in news. Unfortunately  for her, her career  is rather going  downhill. #karma1
@Bitterati_91 @apurvnagpal Desperate for her? She will b the last creature khans will b desperate to sign. If they want to sign her n she refused doesn't  make them desperate? It's her lost cause Sultan collected big n u know the outcome of Rangoon n Simran at the end.😂

@antifragile123 @apurvnagpal The problem is, she is celebrating  the success of a movie  which till date hasn't  recovered its half budget 😂
@Bitterati_91 @apurvnagpal Even Raki would have collected more than this should  she get 3000+ screen, republic holiday with no tight competion. But this is kangana, she had positive  reviews but no footfall. That's  the sign of declining  b grade actress. The collection  is not something  to b proud  of.

@niSHULk_opinion @iFaridoon @Apurvasrani @DirKrish No much social media then, and I remember this issue came in news papers. So yes, they called him out. So does it also give kangana right to steal someone credit? This ain't her first time. That means, she is the problem

@KRKBoxOffice Wooow, it can touch 170cr
@KRKBoxOffice That one is constant
@shahrukhdevdas I know, but the woman representing that respectful warrior is the problem, he should also understand that. A woman who said she has no respect for the industry that feeds her. Its still linger in peoples mind. Such an ungrateful she is

How can one live like that? No respect for her colleagues nor any elderly. n her 2 to 3 fans think she is baddass n fearless.

She must learn to show love n respect to reciprocate it. N who in kangana entire life did she ever respect? Not even her parant. No one wants to associate with controversial creature.
@ASGaur07 @cheerfulperson1 @Rangoli_A Ahahaha, flopnikarnika will wait till thy kingdom comes to recover its cost.
@cheerfulperson1 @ASGaur07 @Rangoli_A Lol, the collection should have been more than that going by the 3000+ screen count with no big competition at the box office.

@AgarwallNikitta @KanganaDaily Lmao, does kangana even has fans? I can count them on twitter
@AgarwallNikitta @aliaa08 @DreaminBigWide Kangana should also give thanks and credit to Aditya Pancholi.
@AgarwallNikitta @aliaa08 And kangana can go for your HUSBAND to get what she wants n even have gut to boast about it on National  TV. What a cheap n two face woman. As she said, she is their mistress.
@AgarwallNikitta @DreaminBigWide Lmao, U won't even get, so die peacefully cause she doesn't earn it to even get.
@AgarwallNikitta @aliaa08 Yh, mine is also how kangana is arrogant, lack humity n overrated. But one thing that took Alia far is her humility which u seems not to get it. Your acting alone can't take u far.
@AgarwallNikitta @aliaa08 What ever, keep suffocating cause know Bollywood fraternity will praise her cause she's not Worth's it.
@AgarwallNikitta @aliaa08 She is not the only outsider. There r lots n lots of outsider but they are humble n coexist with insiders n they also became insiders. You don't have to baddass by abusing people thinking u are fearless. There r tons ways of voicing  ones views by not abusing n harassing.
@AgarwallNikitta @aliaa08 I also replied what I think is right since u pretend u haven't read how she abuse her colleagues in the media n u expect them to praise her.

@cheerfulperson1 @ssngage @SumitkadeI @iHrithik And she is the only actress who more movies than any actress yet she is irrelevant cause of karma
@cheerfulperson1 @ssngage @SumitkadeI @iHrithik He regress with reason, what of an actress who comes with 4to5 release each year n still stuck? Kajol, Aish, Rani kareena being mothers with ONLY one release are still in Omax. That Aline should tell u abt your Z grade actress. Ahahaha
@ssngage @cheerfulperson1 @SumitkadeI @iHrithik Ahahaha, her drama doesn't work on audience anymore
@cheerfulperson1 @ssngage @SumitkadeI @iHrithik Ahahaha, at least HR is In omax list, kangaroo has never n will never b till that kingdom come.
@cheerfulperson1 @SumitkadeI @iHrithik I'm happy u said his ex wife n children. Fair enough. Think abt 145cr+ budget on psycho shoulder n stop your obsession with HR on every post that people think if u are real kangaroo. Lma
@cheerfulperson1 @SumitkadeI @iHrithik Ahahaha, now she can use Aditya pancholi strategy to promote her 155cr budget movie.
@cheerfulperson1 @SumitkadeI @iHrithik Its SRK fans who would have back her during the clash just to piss HR fans but she has no HR now to back her. Cheat India all the way. Ahahaha
@cheerfulperson1 @SumitkadeI @iHrithik HR is still very relevant than your sickler in audience eyes. If star doesn't rule, zero would hav bin out of cinema by now n wouldn't clock 81cr+ n stil countin. So calm down n stop inviting more hatred for kangana cause majority hate her.
@cheerfulperson1 @SumitkadeI @iHrithik If I were u, will humble n won't create more hatred for kangana for now as the budget is too high, she has no HR name to lean upon n its not solo release for her.

@jokebazz @Harshit_Asesnio Ahahaha
@BhaktUnofficial @odshek @Pushkarp Not backing this two cause I wasn't there n I don't know Nana's intention nor Tanushree intention, but with Hrithik, he had solid proof n backed his claim but people were silent against kangana cause she is a woman.

@CuriousWhatever @mrsfunnybones Were u not here when kangana sent 3000+ email to Hrithik n edited picture of him n her to claim there was a relationship till Suzanne his ex exposed her lies? Where were u then? Where is her laptop she claimed fel in wata 4 evidence? Where r the engagement pictures between them?
@raj33191 @mithsgad @FarOutAkhtar @janiceseq85 @iHrithik Lol, where is the spot on? Lmao, this psycho n her 123 fans are damn funny
@mithsgad @FarOutAkhtar @janiceseq85 @iHrithik She is irrelevant to Me that I will be bothered
@mithsgad @FarOutAkhtar @janiceseq85 @iHrithik Lol, prasoon joshi had no choice than to stick to her since his money is already in the production. Anand is no more interested in working with her because of her lies against him. Such a problematic woman
RT @himeshmankad: I think not just female, but a lot of male also face sexual harassment at the work place but most of them don't come out…
RT @himeshmankad: No one in this film industry is clean. This is ONE DIRTY Industry - PERIOD
@odshek @Pushkarp The me2 in America has concrete evidence n dey didn't jump all of a sudden bakin dem because dey were women? HR case alone  made me fil sory for Men of India. Do u tink if it had been America, kangana wil find it easy? People were silent n she got it her way becaus she is a woman
@odshek @Pushkarp But two people at present also gave different story.
@raindropssarii @deepikapadukone Very disappointing
@Pushkarp @odshek People like jumping into conclusion. Because she is a woman, so what she said is true n final. That's always Indians perception

@TonightIsTheOne Lmao
@mithsgad @FarOutAkhtar @janiceseq85 @iHrithik Lol, HR himself ask people not 2 backed him so she wouldn't use dat as sympathy card. She stole script from de writer n karma hitin her n director n de lidin actor left becaus of her diabolic character. Moreova, M n Z grade only sign her. no1 in his rt sense even take her serious
@mithsgad @anike34t @FarOutAkhtar @janiceseq85 @iHrithik Don't even understand what u wrote
@DeepikasWarrior She looks sick
@Rashmi69543714 @FarOutAkhtar @janiceseq85 Where were u when kangana edited picture ofvher n HR till Suzanne exposed her? Till date, she could prove HR is her ex. Women like kangana made it very very difficult to believe other women
@mithsgad @FarOutAkhtar @janiceseq85 @iHrithik We see how kanga lied n morphed party picture to make it real till Hrithik ex Suszane exposed her lies. So I beg, don't bring kanaga here. Women like kangana made it very difficult to believe other women.

@PaurushTyagi06 @neetutyagi0 Am just giving u an example. There are stans who have like 20 account n will vote with all. So yes, this polls are unnecessary. They should rather go n vote for their idols at the box office. That is important. I like Ranveer but never waste my time to vote for him.

@RanbirK09 @Rmnhosai @ranbirisation @SumitkadeI So yes, both sanju took advantages of the directors n the controversies. But the difference is, sanju got wider release with high ticket price n got released in all states without fear. Let's unite n cheer this two n stop petting them against each other. This two can act.
@RanbirK09 @Rmnhosai @ranbirisation @SumitkadeI N sanju took advantage of more screen counts, Sanjays life it self is controversy n Hirani brand. Got released in all states without any fear. Imagine if Padmavat got all is this.
@ranbirisation @Rmnhosai @SumitkadeI No, if u think someones opinion is the gospel truth, then u have long way to go. I don't hate Ranbir, but if u think controversies helped Padmavat, then I also have to indicate to u what helped Sanju at the box office. Its so simple
@ranbirisation @SumitkadeI No, it worked cause of Hirani n sanjay controversial life, period.
@ranbirisation @Rmnhosai @SumitkadeI Why will I agree with someone's opinion whiles the reality is crystal clear. Hirani factor n sanjay life factor is working big time at the box office. 30% is due to Ranbir. Period
@ranbirisation @SumitkadeI sanju benefited cause of Hirani, sanjay controversy life, released in all States n had more screen counts than all previous releases. Had padmavat got all this, imagine the hurricane it would have cause. But alhemdullillah
