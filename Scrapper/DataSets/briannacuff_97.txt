@averymcdaniel_ i didn’t say don’t tip. i said no one should be obligated to tip a certain amount. i ain’t mad lol
@averymcdaniel_ yup, expected someone to say that. like i said, the world owes nobody anything. if waitressing isn’t getting you by, get a new job. other people aren’t responsible for making sure you’re making enough money. harsh but true. for everyone. regardless of what job you chose to have.
unless someone held a gun to ur head &amp; demanded u be a waitress, i do NOT want to hear about how it’s MY responsibility to tip u a certain amount of cash so u can afford rent. u should focus on the fact that ur employer is legally allowed to underpay u. the world owes u nothing!
