Thus far, Trump has been more than willing to try and negotiate with the Democrats to no avail. At some point, talk and rhetoric become cheap and you have to just accomplish something through pragmatism and action.
I understand that religion shouldn‚Äôt necessarily be tainted by worldly political affairs, however I cannot help but compare @realDonaldTrump to Nehemiah in the Old Testament. Like Nehemiah, Trump is determined to build a border wall for the protection of this country.

And finally on climate change: If you are a proponent of enterpenurship then ‚Äúleading boldly on climate change‚Äù should mean market solutions and government intervention to correct for market failures. It does NOT mean wholesale government control of the environmental industry.
In terms of healthcare: I actually do agree that the American healthcare system is deeply flawed and in need of more stringent regulation and oversight. However, we cannot just make it all ‚Äúfree.‚Äù Taxes will have to go up and the 1% are NOT going to be picking up the entire tab.
When you make something ‚Äúfree‚Äù or heavily subsidized (ex. College tuition) EVERYONE wants to get their hands on it so it‚Äôs value drops precipitously. When university is reserved for those who truly have the skills to complete it, it‚Äôs going to be scarce and thus its value high.

I.e. The governemnt would not and should not spend more than it takes in. Like any household or small business (even large business), the moment you being using credits to pay off other credit card debt you have crossed into financial insanity.
So knowing this, why do we constantly have this cycle between opposition parties where the minority pretends to care about the debt. Nobody gives any Sugar Honey Ice Teas about National Debt. If we did, spending relative to revenue would precipitously decrease post haste.
Specifically, I am referencing opportunity costs, trade-offs and the national debt, which compounds annually at an enormous interest rate. Our federal income taxes only service the interest on the debt. The principal will never get touched.
We have had 1 TRILLION dollar deficits annually for every fiscal year for a long time now. The government was shutdown over 5.7 BILLION  dollars for a wall. Take a moment to consider that. Since when have lawmakers cared about economics?
Conservative hawks should cool their jets over this shutdown ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù from Trump. He did what was necessary in order to reach a temporary compromise/truce. Political obstinance, whether you believe it is principled or not, is horrible optics.

@MuneerKurdFeyli @OfficialSPGB @McAllisterDen Government is almost unnecessary in this regard. The proper role of government is to enforce laws to ensure people are not cheating one another. That does not involve artificially setting interest rates based on the fallible intuition of the human mind.

@MuneerKurdFeyli @OfficialSPGB @McAllisterDen It is clear you are going to remain entrenched in your Marxist orthodoxy and this conversation has long since ceased to be productive. Good day sir, hopefully one day you realize the error in your ways.
@MuneerKurdFeyli @OfficialSPGB @McAllisterDen It is always government institutions and short sighted politicians that cause dysfunction in the economy. Without question.
@MuneerKurdFeyli @OfficialSPGB @McAllisterDen The day Nixon took the US off the gold standard was the day that any semblance of economic sanity disappeared. The dollar was no longer tethered to anything tangible in the real world that could not be reproduced such as gold. Hence the endless quantitative easing and inflation.
@MuneerKurdFeyli @OfficialSPGB @McAllisterDen Right, because the Federal Reserve and it‚Äôs fake money created out of thin air are instruments of the free market? ü§£
@MuneerKurdFeyli @OfficialSPGB @McAllisterDen If you were capable of any kind of deep philosophical and intellectual thought you would understand this intuitively. However, clearly that is not the case.
@MuneerKurdFeyli @OfficialSPGB @McAllisterDen Again I return to the I Pencil argument: There is not one single person or small group of people intelligent enough to create a pencil. It requires the know how if millions of different economic actors all acting in their own self interest.
@MuneerKurdFeyli @OfficialSPGB @McAllisterDen You see what happens is that power hungry Socialists gain control of the government and then institute short sighted policies that exacerbate boom and bust cycles. Rather than allowing the market to correct itself, Socialists endeavor to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the problems the perpetually create.

@MuneerKurdFeyli @OfficialSPGB @McAllisterDen The planet will be just fine. I am not invested in the stock market as of yet because I am just beginning to enter the workforce. The sun will continue to rise. These boom and bust cycles are a result of Socialists attempting to force the economy in one direction or the other.
@MuneerKurdFeyli @OfficialSPGB @McAllisterDen Yeah.... I am not disputing that. I said that criticism of Socialism was INCIDENTAL. https://t.co/h1w5TWDQZC
@MuneerKurdFeyli @OfficialSPGB @McAllisterDen Capitalism on its own merits is superior to Socialism. This entire conversation has literally been me defending Capitalism for its propensity to foster voluntary exchange of property rights between consenting parties. Criticizing Socialism is incidental.
Daily reminder that Leftists are economic illiterates. Remember to have a blessed day and to thank the economic system that creates all the wealth we enjoy: Capitalism.

@MuneerKurdFeyli @OfficialSPGB @McAllisterDen That technological innovation however is not going to come from a Socialist Politburo full of central planners and technocrats but from entrepreneurs operating in the free market for profit. Once again, facts do not care about your feelings.
@MuneerKurdFeyli @OfficialSPGB @McAllisterDen As these countries begin to develop they are going to start polluting more. China and India are good examples. At that point, hopefully technology will be such that most of the negative externalities of pollution can be mitigated effectively.
@MuneerKurdFeyli @OfficialSPGB @McAllisterDen Those are chronically undeveloped countries and continents whose citizens live in abject poverty. Pollution is a necessary trade off for affluence and economic well being. If you are so outraged by this, then move to those countries and try living there without internet.
