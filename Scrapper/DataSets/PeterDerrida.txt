@BWSchank @JeffPassage @gosuperaa @PaulsWalls2 @cbmccranie1769 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @Standing_Word @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien It is a religion. You deny it because you've bought into the whole "It's a personal relationship, not a religion" new agey line. Christianity is a religion. We have rituals. We have sacred texts. We gather on a specified day. We have do's and don'ts.
@cbmccranie1769 @BWSchank @gosuperaa @PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @Standing_Word @higham_mark @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien See here's the thing: Jesus was not a hyper literalist. He saw the spiritual meaning in those words. He didn't say "eww gross! that is spiritualizing it and making it symbolic." He wasn't talking about a political figure like you imagine, because you think like zealots.
@cbmccranie1769 @BWSchank @gosuperaa @PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @Standing_Word @higham_mark @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien Look at what Jesus said: "He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives." Did Jesus do that in your hyper literal sense of treating the bible? "To set at liberty those who are oppressed." Did Jesus do that hyper literally?
@cbmccranie1769 @BWSchank @gosuperaa @PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @Standing_Word @higham_mark @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien I have heard almost every dispy claim Luke 4 supports their point of view, but to me I find it mind boggling. If Jesus didn't spell it out for you, how many of you guys would even recognize that as being fulfilled?
@cbmccranie1769 @BWSchank @gosuperaa @PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @Standing_Word @higham_mark @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien Jesus pointed to a fulfilled prophecy. Do dispensationalists even allow for that to be a possibility? You guys just have string after strong after string of unfulfilled prophecy after prophecy that to an outsider makes it look make believe.

It is basically the end of history.

The Pharisees show up and start acting like haters so Jesus tells the Parable of the Lost Sheep, then the Parable of the Lost Coin, and then the Parable of the Prodigal Son.
@HunterWilkes11 @BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Well the point of the parables was to confuse the lost people when Jesus spoke in front of large groups. Jesus begins a set of sermons in which only the first was called a parable, but the others were clearly in that format as well.
@BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word The Parable of the Great Banquet in Luke 14 doesn't call itself a parable, but the parallel in Matthew 22 calls itself a parable.

@HunterWilkes11 @BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word So if the purpose of the parables was to conceal a deeper message from those on the outside, would those on the outside have understood the Prodigal Son?
@HunterWilkes11 @BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word What was the point?
@BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word If this is not allegorical, what is the point?

@BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word How much clearer does he have to be? The Parable of the Great Banquet is a parable. It has all of the elements of a parable. Jesus trusts that you to have the brain cells to realize it with out it being spelled out for you like a child.
@BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word In Luke 15, Jesus did not announce that he was telling a parable when he told the Parable of the Prodigal Son. Was that not a parable?
@BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word In Luke 14, Jesus did not call The Parable of the Great Banquet a parable. Do you think it wasn't a parable?
@BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word He did not say the Good Samaritan was a parable. Do you deny that it was a parable based simply on the fact that Jesus did not spell it out for you?
@christislifted1 @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I don't think he understands death in a non-hyper literal sense.

Isaac was 40 when he took Rebekah. Esau was 40 when he took Judith. 40 days required for embalming the dead. People at manna for 40 years. Moses on the mountain for 40 days. The list goes on.

In the Jewish mindset 40 was not one more than 39 or one less than 41. 40 is 40 because 40 is special.

@Lex_Lutheran Having said that, I suppose the "suck it up buttercup" types might be confined to a particular cultural generation. All of my WWII era working-class relatives were not particularly big on public grieving. It was actually taboo.
@Lex_Lutheran It wouldn't be smart to go up to someone in the anger stage of grief and say "accept that this is God's will or else you're an open theist heretic!" It is a product of wisdom.
@Lex_Lutheran Bad things happen. Even secular psychologists believe that the final stage of the grieving process is acceptance. I don't know what the secularist bases that acceptance on, but as Christians we have God's sovereignty.
@Lex_Lutheran This is seems to be more of a pastoral issue, which might vary from person to person and issue to issue. Some people hear "it wasn't meant to be" and find comfort. Others don't. Some hear "suck it up buttercup" and they find it insensitive. Others hear it and find strength.

@RScottClark @DavidBancz @rachelgmiller97 @eperry2011 Like I said, I am a new Christian (a little over a year) and I am still working through these issues. I cannot express how much I appreciate the dialogue. It has been food for thought.
@RScottClark @DavidBancz @rachelgmiller97 @eperry2011 It is a Stoic concept. Would Moses have spoken about NL? Any of the prophets? Can it be taken as anything other than a rhetorical allusion or appropriation for former pagans to sink their teeth in? What if Paul alluded to Aristotle? Should we take from him uncritically?
@RScottClark @DavidBancz @rachelgmiller97 @eperry2011 I am not familiar with name in that group. It seems to be a code for liberal, almost revolutionary and what little I know about Kuyper is antithetical to that. My concern is that because we have what appears to be a polemical allusion by Paul to NL does that require synthesis?
@RScottClark @DavidBancz @rachelgmiller97 @eperry2011 More as a product of the history of ideas. The fact that people cannot agree about what it actually constitutes outside of Christian assumptions points to it being a product of worldview. The Stoics spoke of it. Paul seems to allude to it but he considered their thinking futile
@RScottClark @DavidBancz @rachelgmiller97 @eperry2011 I suppose it depends on how much the truth is suppressed and how much they have become futile in their thinking.
@RScottClark @DavidBancz @rachelgmiller97 @eperry2011 Natural law seems like a fine concept in a Christian society with similar cultural assumptions which can be taken as natural, but look at historical anthropology: what is considered natural varies more than drastically. Being "given over" is not super rare
@RScottClark @DavidBancz @rachelgmiller97 @eperry2011 Van Til struck me the first time as a bit of a wrecking ball. I am a new convert so I do not mean to sound like an expert, but my takeaway was that natural law was predicated on neutrality which Van Til seemed to have called into serious question
@DavidBancz @RScottClark @rachelgmiller97 @eperry2011 I came to Christianity from a postmod background and the postmods made a convincing case about the inability to know anything based on anything including natural law. Van Til provides an answer for a positive epistemology.
@DavidBancz @RScottClark @rachelgmiller97 @eperry2011 I thought Van Til and the postmods destroyed that concept beyond repair. A Christian has a different understanding of the "natural" compared to the Stoic or the Aztec or the LGBT activist or the racist slave owner.

@elencticae @drantbradley @machenwarrior @michaelkelley Thank you for the book recommendation. I'll give it an open-minded look.
@elencticae @drantbradley @machenwarrior @michaelkelley It wasn't my intention to come across as a know it all. I've only been a Christian for a little over a year, but I've dove into the writings. From what I've gathered the laissez faire amillennial attitude towards things outside the church is not classic reformed thought.
@elencticae @drantbradley @machenwarrior @michaelkelley Wow that was escalated quickly. I was not talking about neo-Kuyperians. I was talking about the diagram. I raised the question: Did Puritan theology have an impact on their attitudes towards labor, commerce, politics, arts, family, etc. or was their faith hermetically sealed?
@elencticae @drantbradley @machenwarrior @michaelkelley If the Puritans were into making diagrams, how different would their diagram be from the above diagram? They weren't apathetic amillennialists focused exclusively on personal piety.

@CoalitionBorg Van Til has a similar diagram https://t.co/cgedVmjGpw
@CoalitionBorg In all fairness, the chart has the Kingdom originating outside of the cosmos.
@adrianturner01 @sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word Jude: I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints.
@adrianturner01 @sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word Because nobody is writing scripture today
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word That's not what I'm saying. The spirit is present in all believers but that doesn't mean that we have Jedi powers.
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word I gave you the scriptural proof of Paul saying they would pass. Accusing the early church of Antisemitism (without any proof I might add) is not sufficient to prove your case that talking gibbish today is a miracle
@chuck_finney @ThomasCoutouzis I suppose if you replaced the concept of righteousness with the concept of equality as defined by secular humanists
RT @jg_machen: The cardinal principle of unbelief is that miracles have never happened.
RT @Bald_Calvinist: https://t.co/VjH6Nxgag7
RT @Kdubtru: facts! https://t.co/v2mSPq5F7N
@chuck_finney @ThomasCoutouzis So that means he basically tossed out God's Law as the standard for justice and substituted his own political ideology in its place. It's quite something to behold.
@chuck_finney @ThomasCoutouzis It's generic leftism dressed up in postmillennial verbiage. In a follow up Tweet he gives a specific example of the "just preach the gospel" Christians: it was an IFB group who wasn't calling for "just preaching the gospel," they were calling for Mosaic Law.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word They had to worship YAHWEH in the way prescribed.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word They had to live by the Old Covenant. They couldn't change their DNA or join a tribe, and if they wanted to reject the Pharisees' incorrect interpretations of the law, then that would be fine as well.
@sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word I believe that people are not being inspired with special revelation in the ways they were when scripture was being written.
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word Did you get a prophecy about that from your imagination?
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word If revelation didn't stop there would be more scripture.
@machenwarrior So in his vision people should focus on fighting inequality without exerting much emphasis on spreading the gospel and certainly not investing any efforts on reducing clearly defined immorality. It sounds like generic liberalism dressed up in postmillennial verbiage.
@machenwarrior So if I understand this correctly, GCC means people who just want to preach the gospel and make no social change as well as people who want to crush social evil on earth in a way described in God's Law. Is the problem their understanding of kingdom doesn't equal his politics?
@machenwarrior He called GCC a truncated view that focuses solely on gospel spreading rather than fighting evil. Well in a subsequent tweet he gave a specific example of GCC: an IFB who wasn't talking about just gospel preaching. IFB guy wanted Mosaic capital offense laws. This is confusing!
@sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark For other people who were not as invested in hating God as I was, this process can happen pretty quickly. It could be something as simple as turning to a Christian radio channel that you normally skip over but because of regeneration you become intrigued and hungry.
@sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark I'll give an example from my case. I openly hated God with a passion, but unbeknown to me I was regenerated and my heart started to soften and become alive. I went from "I hate God" to "maybe I've been wrong but probably not" to "I was very very wrong" to "God is great!" etc
@sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark We define regeneration as the means by which a person goes from a state of hating God to a state of loving God and proclaiming faith. Regeneration is very subtle and subconscious. Most people don't even realize it is happening to them.
@sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark I think I understand where things are getting confusing. Quite often people mistake regeneration with sanctification. They aren't the same thing.
@drantbradley Don't get me wrong. I get a perverse guilty pleasure from messing with IFBs for embarrassing my faith, but it raises questions: by what standard do we as covenant people define evil? Is it a social construct? Is it natural law? Is it from special revelation? Can we truncate?
@drantbradley I'm confused. I thought your critique of GCC was that it neglected our responsibility that "evil needs to be purged" for "a cosmic redemptive eschatological hope for the new earth." Is there adultery on the new earth?

@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word Of course. The era of those gifts has ended.
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word There are prophecies of the destruction of the temple, but nobody in scripture says the temple had been destroyed. Based on the absence of mentioning that colossal event we assume scripture was complete before that event happened. Plus Clement says the canon closed during Nero.
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word Scripture is my final authority. Paul said those gifts would cease. Everyone in the early church said they had ceased. You asked for citation from the early church. I gave just a few to you, then you blasted me for citing them.
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word Everywhere in scripture signs and wonders were for the era of new revelation. When revelation stops there can't be a divine revelation announcing that the divine revelation had stopped because that would be a contradiction of the point it was making. Do you see?
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word Yep, and even he turned on his own based kind based on the clarity of evidence
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word NOBODY THOUGHT THE GIFTS WERE STILL CONTINUING! WHAT AUGUSTINE THOUGHT WAS THE SAME AS EVERYONE ELSE!
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word "In the earliest times, the Holy Spirit fell upon them that believe and they spoke with tongues, which they had not learned, as the Spirit gave them utterance. These were signs adapted to the time... That thing was done for a sign, and it passed away." Augustine
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word "This whole place is very obscure: but the obscurity is produced by our ignorance of the facts referred to and by their cessation, being such as then used to occur but now no longer take place."

@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word We had the ultimate sign and wonder: the full canon of scripture. Scripture along with God's providence in history is all we needed.
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word How could someone write scripture after the closing of the era announcing that the era had closed?
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word I said by 70 AD because that's when I believe that the canon of scripture was closed and the critical era of revelation history had closed. Early churchmen also believed that those signs had ceased.
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word I'm sorry but you need to understand biblical theology. Signs and wonders only happen during critical eras of revelation history. That's how it always happened. Paul knew that as well. He knew the critical era was ending.
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word It ends when nobody is doing it anymore with any legitimacy. I would say by 70 AD
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word In other words, what is going on today with people claiming to speak in tongues and give prophecies is essentially blasphemous. Please stop.
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word "Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away." (1 Corinthians 13:8)
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word Please understand me. It's not the gift of the spirit! The apostles weren't playing make believe. They were talking real languages as a sign of their authority from God. The gentiles received it as a sign of the covenant extending to them too. That's the point of all this.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word I do not deny scripture. Do you know what the scriptural punishment is for going around doing fake miracles and making false prophecies?
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word It's not irrelevant. They thought they had the gift, but it turns out they were deceiving themselves with spiritual pride of being gifted. It's a hoax. The period of those gifts is over.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word It's not irrelevant. Like I said, anyone can do it. You just have to allow yourself to act foolishly.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word I'm not denying scripture. I believe your movement has redefined people talking in other real, understandable, translatable languages into talking crackhead talk.
@higham_mark @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word LOL did you hear about all the Pentecostals who went to Africa and thought their tongues were real so they didn't need to learn the local language and basically humiliated themselves horribly
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word Most of the homeless crackheads in my neighborhood must be super spiritual then. They talk gibberish all the time and I've even heard a few prophecies.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word Gibberish isn't a gift. Anyone can do it. Some of us are not going to deceive ourselves into thinking it has anything to do with God.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word Scripture forbids babble.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word So the key to talking nonsense is to think you've got a gift that you don't have so it can't be nonsense? Okay I am beginning to understand.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word I agree what these people are doing has nothing to do with scripture.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word I'm suggesting that what happened to them was from God. Talking nonsense is to feel spiritual when you're not.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word I've got the whole world wide internet at my disposal and I've never seen anyone not look insane or pathetic when they are talking in tongues.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word I'm not an apostle. I don't have those gifts, and neither do you, because if you did then you are being selfing typing away on twitter instead of healing all the kids in the cancer ward.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word From what I can discern I see fakers at best, people plagued with demons at worst.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word The apostles were under-educated guys from Galilee speaking languages they didn't know so unbelievers would be in marvel. What goes on today has nothing to do with that.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word You see apostles going around healing people super easy to not being able to do anything for sick people but pray for them. The signs were for the season of the new revelation. They would pass away. Joshua wasn't doing the same miracles as Moses.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word Yes, and there's evidence in scriptures of this practice gong from people talking languages they don't know to people babbling and having to be warned about it.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word I showed you video clip after video clip of people talking babble. I've seen countless hours of this garbage. It's all fake. These people don't know what to say to God so they babble to Him to spice up their prayer life. It's a hoax.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word I've never seen someone speak in tongues in this day and age and not look like they are wasting everyone's time. I'm open to be corrected. Show me something.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word Now if some white girl from Arkansas who can't even speak English properly starts talking perfect Mandarin. That's a different story, but that's not what's going on today is it?
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word I'm not twisting it. If you're in your closet talking babble, how is it helpful to an unbeliever? If you're in church talking babble and unbelievers think you're crazy, how is it helpful to an unbeliever? All this rests on the fact that you're not doing something asinine.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word Now we're getting somewhere. Do you think Paul equated pointless babble with speaking in tongues?
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word I restrict meaningless babble from my prayer life and so should you.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word He also says "Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers" ... " If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds?"
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word Jesus said pray "LIKE THIS." Meaning that it is a good model for prayer life. Give honor to His transcendence and power. Express thanks. Ask for protection. These things can be personalized for you, but notice before this he says don't babble.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word Paul wasn't referring to milk as a basic necessity.

Jesus said to pray like this: “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven...." not like "babababbabababa"
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word Moses came with a new revelation and he performed signs. Jesus came with a new revelation and he performed signs. The apostles brought that new revelation and they performed signs. Did you notice the number of signs dropping as the NT proceeded?
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word Scripture doesn't really speak of miracles in the originals. It speaks of signs, wonders, and marvelous works. These signs are actually pretty rare in scripture. They come at times of new revelation to establish authority in the early stage of the revelation.

@thatbrian @clbolt I have noticed PCA varies from local to local. There are 4 in my county. Each one has its own flavor. I figured it isn't unique to here or the PCA, eg, I know PCUSA congregations way more conservative than some PCA congregations.
@clbolt OPC
Reformed Episcopal Church
@southernevange1 "I've been on five continents and several countries"
How does that work?
@XpCoulson @RScottClark Yep. I should also mention that the RPCUSA who is openly theonomic was the first to jump into action about the Fed Vis controversy stating the Westminster standards and calling for repentance. It was swift. It was on point. It wasn't mixed up with a bunch of other baggage.
@XpCoulson It is stuff like this that inspired my original comment that "I suspect that if the people involved in the FV drama were good ole apathetic amills there would have been a calm, charitable discussion rather than a freak out."
@XpCoulson As one 2k amil critic in PCA explained: "Federal Vision is the natural progression of the principles of theonomy. That is why many the 1st generation federal visionists are theonomists" and postmil "theonomy and the Federal Vision are not identical but they are twins."
@XpCoulson As I understand it, things went nuts in the PCA. The Billy Graham type evangelicals freaked out over a higher view of the sacraments and "elitism". The 2K amils freaked out because they equated FV as the new face of their true enemy: (not the secular humanists) postmil theonomy
@XpCoulson No Baptist here. I attend an OP church. The OPC did not spin out of control over FV. It was determined that the FVists and New Perspective on Paul had some very valid points to make although "aberrant views on justification have been promulgated from within these circles"
@XpCoulson That probably points to my ignorance of what happened. It might explain the hesitance to engage in another, probably bigger fight. For my part I probably cut some of the FV crowd extra slack because I really like some of their thought provoking work on typology.
@XpCoulson Like I said, I'm a new convert so that has certain downsides (ignorance) and certain insights (fresh eyes), and I can't help but notice what gets people institutionally riled up and what doesn't. What would you find if you really looked at the woke view of justification?
@XpCoulson I read the OPC report. If I recall correctly it got much more heated in the PCA so I might check that out, but my suspicion has not been that it was overtly about postmil, which has been deemed a legit view. Thus people don't go after each other explicitly on those grounds.
@thatbrian @XpCoulson @PresbyPolemics One more clarification: Let's imagine that Van Til was postmill. I'm not saying that people would have gone after Van Til for being postmill. I'm saying that if Van Til was postmill they would have gone after him for his idiosyncratic articulation of the Trinity.
@thatbrian @XpCoulson @PresbyPolemics I'm a recent convert and I could totally be misreading the situation, but I can't help but notice that the slow moving institutions don't ever get into gear unless a theologically conservative postmill says something incorrect, real or imagined. Lesbian woke warriors are cool tho
@thatbrian @XpCoulson @PresbyPolemics I'm going to suggest something a lil controversial, but I suspect that if the people involved in the FV drama were good ole apathetic amills there would have been a calm, charitable discussion rather than a freak out. Amills get up in arms when postmills target their apathy.

@EvenWokerPresby Bruce Waltke, a reformed OT scholar who also taught at Machen's seminary, was also strongly in favor of abortion. He said the unborn child didn't have a soul and abortion has nothing to do with the 5th commandment and it was primarily an economic decision.
@EvenWokerPresby Not just silent though. Paul Woolley, who was there at Westminster Seminary's founding as the leading church historian, who was there with Machen for the OPC's founding, was adamantly pro-abortion and called an unborn child an "entity" and "abstraction"
@EvenWokerPresby This is something uncomfortable to talk about, but all the amill institutions were silent too. As far as I know nobody in the reformed world even attempted to address the issue until the postmill resurgence.
@EvenWokerPresby This type of Christian pessimism and denial of responsibility led to the silence. It also led to the vacuum that Social Justice progressives are attempting to fill.
@EvenWokerPresby They felt it was wrong to get involved in issues of justice because we are just passing through this life with our eyes fixed on heavenly spiritual things. The world was going to inevitably keep getting worse so why polish the brass on a sinking ship?

It seems like a driving factor.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @Standing_Word Okay so if you do it does that merit anything? No, you're back to square one, and if you do it with an improper heart you're worse off then before. So since it is an act of grace (even though it requires getting off your butt) it is not a works based system.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @Standing_Word Let me clarify. A reprobate is unelect, not simply a bad boy sinner. No human knows who is a reprobate and it is sinful to presume that you have that power.

@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @Standing_Word You're misunderstanding this. To sacrifice an animal for sin might seem like work to you, but it was actually a means of Grace.

@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I want to also add that Augustine did not invent this approach. It was a very common method of interpreting scripture. Philo of Alexandria used it. All of the NT writers used it as well.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I'm not so sure about that.

@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word So you don't reject God's law, you just reject the idea that you have any obligation to acknowledge it as applicable for you?
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Nothing you've said up this point has indicated that you see any of those things as applicable to Christians.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word You need to put on your thinking cap and interpret it based on what it is trying to convey. Scripture doesn't baby us by spelling out every use of figures or symbols or double meanings. It expects us to see it.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Or they were reading scriptures and singing psalms and learning those things because they were deepening in their faith
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I didn't say that everything was allegorical.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word So if I look in the writings of Paul I won't find page after page after page after page of quotes from Judaism?
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word That's the nature of a dichotomy. The two parts are warring against each other.

@RegReformedGuys If I understand the PB position correctly, it is that the decision is the result of regeneration and the "general" baptist sees it in reverse. 

Now certainly the atheist has no category for regeneration, only social conditioning and existential insecurity.

@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Or that's how you patch the holes in your busted theology :(
@RegReformedGuys That's why I threw in the "not a good look" part to draw attention to the surface of it. Jokes and polemics aside, a particular baptist and an atheist have different reasons behind their objections. They just happen to semantically overlap.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word You follow your own delusions. Are you not a man?
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Paul makes vague statements that you are stretching way beyond their reasonableness and to the point of actually contradicting things Paul said. You're confusing yourself
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word They spoke of it. Have you not read about the knowledge of YAHWEH going out to ends of the earth?
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?!
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word What mysteries? Be specific? Are you talking about something like nobody knew that some guy named Saul would be told by the spirit not to go to some particular town? What are you actually saying?
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Uhh that's now how prophecy works. The details unfold and get more specific over time. The emphasis is on continuity not discontinuity. That's a dispensationalist problem.
@RegReformedGuys Let them make their own decision when they are old enough to make it for themselves is the credo position, is it not?
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Not theologically :(
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word So you're saying that because someone didn't keep the Sabbath holy they are free to go around committing mass murder? What are you actually saying?
@RegReformedGuys I'll paraphrase what I recall reading from the thread: 

LET THEM MAKE THEIR OWN DECISION IF THEY WANT TO JOIN YOUR STUPID CULT LET THEM DO IT THEMSELVES!
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word “All that the prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?” And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I don't see that in my Bible. Do you have the expanded KJV?
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word The audience was the church in the first century. You're thinking like a liberal.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word So you listed one thing which can be debated. Do you have any more?
@Lex_Lutheran @PresbyPolemics Not a good look. They had some of the same arguments too
@sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Not I. I think churches and Christians that refuse to participate in it open themselves up to serious danger.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word What commandments are Christians allowed to disobey? Prohibitions against murder? Honoring parents? Not stealing? Not worshiping idols? Please tell me which are cool for Christians to not follow.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word You misunderstand James and set him against Paul. Not smart!
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Was he a specter or hologram?
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word If none of it was revealed until Paul, the talk on the road to Emmaus must have been very quiet.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word SOOO why mention it being found in the writings of the prophets?
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word You're confusing yourself. Christ explicitly says that we are under the newer covenant. You just don't like what he has to say.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Is that what you call an answer to the question?
@ReadMoreBible @higham_mark @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word You might find this book in pdf format interesting: 
https://t.co/qWAAWC3Bbx
@sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Yes. I'm sure that's part of what Christ explained on the road to Emmaus!
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word The New Covenant was given by Christ and affirmed by Paul. You are confusing yourself.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word If Paul was announcing some radically unforeseen, totally different message that had 0% connection to anything else in scripture, why does he point to this info being in "the scriptures of the prophets" in the very next verse?
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word You're the one confusing the message of the Apostles with the message of the Judaizers.
@adrianturner01 @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word It happened to Saul during ancient times, but I do not claim it happens today. What I was referring to is a measure of what is often called God's "Common Grace" to unbelievers.
@sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I'm just wondering about the accusation. It's an odd accusation.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word He was differentiating his message from the HERETICS, the other apostles were not heretics BTW
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word "We all know you aspire to be a Jew Peter" what are you talking about?
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Did you notice that I said "additional assurance"? Good works are also a measure before the Church. Every church worthy of the name would not allow membership to someone who simply claimed faith but lived like an unrepentant heathen 99.9999% of the time.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word So now you're turning Paul against Paul to support your warped interpretation of Paul? Bravo
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Paul told the Church to judge the Church. Jesus told the Church to judge the Church. James told the Church to judge the Church. We are commanded to do this on the basis of behavior.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Good works is for additional assurance. It shows the spirit has sealed you and you're not just engaging in wishful thinking/self-deception. It shows God is actually conforming you to the image of His Son. If that's not happening and you reject the whole idea, you've got problems
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word So if God takes away protection from an individual or group and allows Satan do what he wants, what's going to happen?
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Do you mean you will accept stuff I find from history books and not say something "oh that's just a man made history book"?
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word Well Satan is evil so he does evil
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word "For we are his WORKmanship, created in Christ Jesus FOR GOOD WORKS, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them." Show me your proclaimed faith without works!
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Satan can only do what God allows him to do.
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word God struck down Corinthians for abusing the supper. God struck down Ananias and Sapphira for betraying their baptism. With much blessings come with potential curses.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @PresbyPolemics @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Can you be more specific?
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Sanctification is progressive. I know some people in the hyper grace/dispensationalist camp who reject say sanctification is optional and progressive sanctification is pointless "sin management"

@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word The feeling is mutual :)
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word These were the same people who started developing the idea of free will.

@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Pagan chance filled the vacuum of pagan gods. These thinkers thought the gods were too distant to care
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word They believed in a non personal force called fate. As pagans started questioning their gods as superstition the y embraced chance. These were the philosophers
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word It means the same thing
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I did not call Solomon a story teller. I was referring to Jesus' parable
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Chaos is a pagan concept, especially, I cannot emphasize this enough, in their creation myths. The biblical account lacks this element of chaos
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Proverbs 16:33

@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Or chance is something that exists in the realm of the storyteller
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Chance is a pagan concept that pagan scientists cannot even prove. Chance is just stuff we are ignorant about
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word God says the casting of lots is not random because nothing is. Now if something appears random, chance, coincidental to us that is just because we are ignorant
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Chance is not a biblical concept, nor coincidence
@BWSchank @ReadMoreBible @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word That word appears twice and points to an occurrence

@BWSchank @ReadMoreBible @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word It appears once. You argument is with Strong's
@jasonhatch20 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word Is it a crime to talk about his demons and instability that he wears on his sleeves in his personal life and writing style?
@jasonhatch20 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word The guy doing yoga to quiet the demons was not the son. It is confusing because they have the same mental health issues
@jasonhatch20 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word What? I asked a question. I mixed up Peter S Ruckman who heard demons with Peter S Ruckman Jr who murdered his family. I am not a Ruckman biographer
@BWSchank @ReadMoreBible @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word You mean the word that appears only once in scripture?
@jasonhatch20 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word "It was at this point, on the verge of suicide, that Ruckman began to hear a series of voices. He himself interprets the voices as being the voice of God, for the most part. He thinks that he learned to distinguish the voice of God from the voice of demons through yoga."
@jasonhatch20 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word I think this is his son

@BWSchank @ReadMoreBible @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word A parable is your argument for chance? Scripture says chance does not exist
@BWSchank @ReadMoreBible @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word So the Apostle John was a bad writer for saying he was?
@BWSchank @ReadMoreBible @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Why do you bring up the hypothetical? What happened was always going to happen.

@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Is he the guy who murdered his two kids and killed himself?

@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I've read dispensationalist authors to know what you guys believe. There wasn't a moment where I felt like I was contracted a disease by looking at it. Are you afraid?
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word We're talking about literacy, not uncritically accepting everything someone says. Do you see the difference?
@higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word There is a tendency in independent fundamentalist circles to be afraid of being polluted by books and pride in saying you've never heard of an author.
@rachelgmiller97 There is a belief that the Quran is a fringe Christian lectionary  in Arabic that was heavily edited so when you look at the Quran there's two layers of text. Higher criticism of the Quran is a touchy subject as you can imagine.
@BWSchank @PresbyPolemics @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Listen, I don't pretend to know their situations, but come come on. I just listed the main dispensationalists and they have the same problems. They don't believe in covenants because they are antinomians. Ideas have consequences.
@BWSchank @PresbyPolemics @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I wouldn't say unpardonable, but by the fourth marriage do they even have a category of sin for this that applies to them? Who are they? Are they unbelievers in the entertainment industry or are they supposed men of God?
@PresbyPolemics @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word LOL dispensationalists generally are kinda wild, especially when it comes to rightly dividing their marriages. Ruckman with three wives. Hal Lindsey four wives. C. I. Scofield abandoned his first family and remarried. John Hagee ditched his first wife. COVENANTS ARE FOR THE JEWS!
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Josh, although I strongly disagree with him, is relatively level-headed guy by dispensationalist standards. Ruckman is a madman.
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word How would you know if you are completely ignorant of their works as you say?
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Same here. He acts like he's only ever read one book and he just happens to parrot what all these other well-selling dispensationalists say word for word by total coincidence
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word THANK YOU!
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I know the dispensationalist position fairly well.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word A simple look at history shows that it was only not everlasting the sense that we tend to think of the term everlasting. How is being booted from the land for 1900 years everlasting?
@BWSchank @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word The Church is not literal Israel in every conceivable sense of the word, but nobody actually claims that anyhow. Nobody is entitled to the older covenants. They are outdated. I don't know what promises you're talking about. Being the womb of the Messiah? We're not waiting.
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @TylerMarkJ @adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Yep. That's why you guys call it a secret rapture. Don't act confused when we speak of it in those terms.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word The tree is God's covenant community unto salvation.

@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Dispensationalists call it a secret rapture, like a thief in the night they say

@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Imagine being a NT writer and you want to communicate the idea of covenant to your audience. What would you do? Go to the Septuagint and see how it talks about covenant. You'd see diatheke so you use it. Then imagine people twisting your words to not mean covenant. :(
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I'm not trying to be rude, but antinomianism is rampant among dispensationalists, who tend to view sanctification as being an optional part of salvation that might only touch super-disciples, who many accuse of just showing off.
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.

This already happened
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word SAme word
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word diatheke is how the LXX translates the Hebrew word berith (covenant)
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word diatheke is covenant
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Reformed people do not see themselves as Israel in every sense of the word. We speak symbolically in covenantal terms set by the New Covenant. God has one people not based on DNA but by covenant. We are spiritual heirs of Abraham, not by blood, but by covenant
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word So are you one of those people who thinks covenants are just for THE JEWS and  non-Jews can just be antinomian and live like heathens because they just need a personal relationship with sweet baby Jesus?
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word There is a spot in Hebrews were there is some word play by the author where there is double meaning being expressed but our God is essentially covenantal. Jesus did not change that
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Yes but it should always have a footnote
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word My confession is not KJV onlyist! Are you for real?
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word What so Hebrew 8 is about a covenant and the Lord's supper is about testament even though they are the same word? That seems odd!
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word If you mean a testimony (collection of writings) of the covenant then fine, but dispensationalists do not mean that.
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word The word means covenant. It is a major thematic concept of the entire arc of scripture. To play with the language so to confuse this is to do violence to God's word. Jeremiah was not plaing. Daniel was not playing. Jesus was not playing. Our God is covenantal
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Are you talking about the KJV?
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word What? We are covenantal because scripture is covenantal. Jesus brought the new covenant that replaced the older one. God has one people
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word If that is so they were not being faithful to the Greek
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I believe that it is misleadingly translated by the Catholics and Anglicans as Testament but the word is covenant
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Bad translations :( why you afraid of the covenant
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word It is a grotesque perversion
@sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Amen
@BWSchank @ReadMoreBible @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word You equate the body of Christ with gentiles for no good reason
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word It is a translation issue for the vulgate
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word He is a Paul-Onlyist. He rejects everyone else as too Jewish for his tastes
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word According to the vulgate, yes. According to the Greek, nope.
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Why do you reject the new covenant?
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word The 613 was a middle ages thing
@sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word He will not listen
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @TylerMarkJ @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word The covenant of grace began after the fall
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word There are those dispys who only accept Paul's prison letters
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @ReadMoreBible @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word He will not answer this because he is basically an anarchist in regards to authority. He does not want a king
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I have been trying to get him to answer those questions since I first started talking to him. Good luck!
@BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word You have wacky interpretation of those verses too
@BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word You are adding stuff to what John wrote
@ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word They are Paul-Onlyists so they just try to find something that says the same thing in Paul even though the continuity undermines their claims of radical discontinuity.
@DerBettler @Lex_Lutheran @brandon_adams @bkben3 I'm not trying to be rude, but if unity was the goal what's the point of getting so close?
@DerBettler @Lex_Lutheran @brandon_adams @bkben3 Is it too much to ask to baptize your kids into the covenant and have some authority above the congregation?
@BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word It's not "first to the Jews and then something completely radically different and distinct and discontinuous to everyone else"

@BWSchank @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs The Holy Spirit is there guiding you and keeping you from permanently falling away, but that means you're no longer autonomous.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Is God making saved people puppets by keeping them from falling away? Isn't that some violation of human rights or something?
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs I agree 100%! So where's the autonomous free will in all that?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Because scripture assumed that people would understand that Saul was under God's judgment.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs For me, I believe that God providentially ensures that His people persevere. This is not a problem for me because I do not have a free will fetish. The Arminians are at least consistent on this issue.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Saul was not sealed. He was an enemy of God. We sing psalms about God graciously crushing Saul, the chief enemy of David.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Saul was a type of antichrist! How many of David's psalms are likely about how God is going to crush Saul for eternity?
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Can they lose their faith and keep their salvation?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Saul was under God's wrath. You're making a big deal about a tiny phrase that clearly indicates that Saul was about to meet his maker.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Samuel said, “Why do you consult me, now that the Lord has departed from you and become your enemy?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Saul was a demonically cursed individual who engaged in a capital offense without any repentance and committed suicide.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Why do you assume that Samuel was saying anything more than soon you're going to die?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs What does it say? What does it not say?
@JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs I'm talking about a man who became a Satanist. He gave his soul to the devil. He engaged in Satanic rituals. God struck him down in the middle of one. This is all shades of grey to you?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Does it really make a difference if he made a profession of faith? Does it mean that he can renounce it and put himself under the headship of Satan with no consequences?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Yeah, in the realm of the dead.
@JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs The inner man wanted to go to a Satanic orgy and God struck him down in the middle of it. What else do you need to know?
@JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Another question: once the Holy Spirit indwells a believer, does the believer lose his free will to become a Satanist until the day he dies?
@JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs OR did he just lose some of his rewards?
@JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Would I be a "fruit inspector" for saying that the guy who had a heart attack in the middle of a Satanic orgy probably wasn't saved to begin with?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs But but but but but OSAS?
@JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs I wish I could find the quote and the source of the quote, but I have heard people from your camp saying something along the lines of there are people who could have died in the middle of performing a Satanic ritual who go to heaven because they once had faith.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs What about through their own free will? Did they lose that when they became a believer?
@JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs I'm not saying that it does include you. Your camp is the camp saying that perseverance is not necessary, meaning that apostasy is okay.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs People don't have the free will to exit?
@JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Falling away from the faith.
@JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Perseverance looks like not dying as an apostate.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 2. 70 years was a symbolic number in the prophetic idiom and the difference between the prophets and the historical records are irrelevant. 

Now these are the two orthodox possibilities. I am open to either one, but option one has some work to do.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 There are two possible orthodox answers. 

1. The hyper-literalists are correct in this one instance: the Babylonian captivity lasted precisely 70 years and every single Babylonian record is incredibly wrong, not by a couple of years but by decades.
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs If you do not persevere , endure, finish the race and you die outside the faith then you get nothing
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Are they going to build a temple with a river that makes the oceans freshwater?

RT @RevLouisBerkhof: God’s providences, both favorable and adverse, are often powerful means of sanctification.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @dispensational @higham_mark The Apostle Paul commended his readers for testing what he said in comparison with other scripture. He was not a Paul-Onlyist. He saw continuity between what he was saying and the whole council of God.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @dispensational @higham_mark Paul who?
@JeffPassage @dispensational @higham_mark I have not purchased this book and I have read many of the early writings and there is no way to honestly present them as dispensationalists. It's actually laughable.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs It's not too hard. Just admit it. You don't have the answers. Say you'll give it some more thought. It's okay
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Like I said: you're being evasive. If you can't answer the question directly, then just say so.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Like I already said: he went off on to some other side road that I wasn't asking about. I'm asking are you persevering in the faith? Do you reject the faith? Do you renounce it? Do you have the power to do that?
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs You are playing games right now. You don't like these questions because you want two contradictory things to be true at the same time. This cannot be the case so you're being slippery.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs He did not answer my question at all. He went off on a totally different side road. Let me ask again: are you persevering in the faith? Do you have the free will to not persevere in the faith?
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Okay this is a joke. Let me know when you are going to stop playing games.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs This is what I was just talking about a minute ago. You're trying to be evasive.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs I'm guessing that you know my answer, but I'm also guessing that you guys will do what you always do when this question comes up: you will try to run away and not being direct. I'm asking you to be direct. Is that asking too much?
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs I asked first
@BWSchank @adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Can you please answer my questions in a direct way? Are you persevering? Do you have the free will to not persevere?
@BWSchank @adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs So what you're saying is that you are persevering and you can't even use your precious free will to separate yourself from God. Is this correct?
@BWSchank @adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs I'm not asking you if you are focusing your mind on persevering. I'm asking you if you are in fact persevering. To not persevere is to walk away from Christ. Does that describe you?
@BWSchank @adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Are you not persevering?

@Riaannels @BWSchank @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @ejioforkel @PTerrone1986 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @NahumOBrien I do not know if you understand the position. When they speak of the evil against the church, they aren't talking about snow on a Sunday. They are talking about people.
@pseudoABoethius @seansgame If it were the typical Christian Entertainment Industry film it would have been all about How Ethan Got His Groove Back, but instead it was about how Ethan found a substitute religion (politics), embraced justification by (political) works, and self destructed.
@pseudoABoethius @seansgame The falling away happened before the film even began. The main character admitted to being incapable of praying. A minister incapable of praying can't perform his office.
@pseudoABoethius @seansgame Well art is subjective. But the theme was apostasy. The HC was the furthest thing from his mind. It was recited as a lackluster reenactment
@pseudoABoethius @seansgame It was. The filmmaker grew up reformed. Went to Calvin College. Became an apostate. It is a look at him in a way as well
@pseudoABoethius @seansgame He completely gave up on reformed thought if he ever believed it in the first place. He had to justify himself. The director went to Calvin College so he knew what he was bringing up and not bringing up
@pseudoABoethius @seansgame They called the church a museum because it was and the main character was like a historical actor like at colonial Williamsburg. He didn't believe it. It was boring to him so when a trendy political issue came up he dove in 100%
@pseudoABoethius @seansgame I agree. I took it as historic reformed theology in the northeast dying like the main character. It was just going through the motions like a Civil War reenactment
@pseudoABoethius @seansgame I think it was great. I liked how it did not try to do what most Christian films do: everyone gets saved!!! It was vacuous because most of Christianity is vacuous. Ethan lost faith and became obsessed with politics. Sound familiar?

Do your hyper literalist thing with this: "And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars."
@higham_mark @ejioforkel @PaulsWalls2 @PTerrone1986 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien This is 100% correct. If he wanted us to know he would have mentioned it. Everyone, no matter how confident, is just speculating. The point is that the two witnesses are part of the covenantal lawsuit against apostate Israel.
@ejioforkel @BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien Elijah is not a spirit that possessed Elisha like a good kind of demon and his spirit didn't jump into John.
@ejioforkel @BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien You have presented texts that you fail to see the deepness of. You interpret it at the most superficial level which you (not just you, but all dispensationalists) fancy as the most God honoring, literal sense
@ejioforkel @BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien That's because Jesus like every single person in scripture was not a wooden literalist! Please, please, please understand this point. You are dishonoring the text by reading it as hyper literal. John was a TYPE of Elijah.
@ejioforkel @BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien If you think Elijah's spirit was literally in John the Baptist then you believe in reincarnation.
@ejioforkel @BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien John the Baptist was not Elijah. He symbolically represented Elijah on a typological level. We do not believe in reincarnation.
@ejioforkel @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien People from all over the Roman Empire came to feast their eyes on the temple. It was one of the major wonders of the world.
@ejioforkel @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien Ezekiel was in exile and God said the exile would end and they would return to the land and build the second temple. He was given a symbolic vision as a sign of God's faithfulness to His promises. It was the second temple.
@ejioforkel @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien Jesus confirmed a new covenant and was cut off making the sacrifice and the oblation obsolete, and before his death he cursed that wicked, abominable, demonically possessed generation and vengeance was poured out on to them.

If you're an apostate it doesn't matter what your DNA is. You're out. My "replacement theology" is the new covenant. The other one was smashed.

@ejioforkel @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien The two witnesses are the required number of testimonies for a conviction in God's covenant lawsuit against Israel. We do not know their names nor do we need to know their names. I would suppose they represent the law and the prophets.
@machenwarrior The atonement and the mustard seed are distinct ideas, right?
@MascotUr @lisasharper I'm sorry you feel that way. Peace.
@MascotUr @lisasharper I don't know anything about this tradition and I don't want to make a snap judgement on a 9 second video. It's not good optics though. It probably should be done away with just like native mascots IMO
@MascotUr @lisasharper Cool. It's a cool song. I'm not knocking it, but like everything it belongs in a proper context. Singing patriotic American songs at American sporting events is one thing. Going up in a foreigners face and singing the National Anthem is something entirely different.
@MascotUr @lisasharper I'm not some dude making stuff up. I learned this in grad school. It's a variation on a custom that goes back centuries. What means to imply is we (i.e., all native people) are united as one against you (the boy in MAGA hat and by extension his entire group).
@MascotUr @lisasharper LOL the song is supposed to be sung together to foster unity among the various native nations. Banging it in a non-native face is provocative. If this is news to you go ask your elders.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ejioforkel @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien Scripture puts forward a demand for balance. We are not to be so spiritually minded that we are no earthly good. We are also advised not to become so focused on earthly things that we lose sight in the other extreme.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ejioforkel @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien There's an earthly kingdom for everyone. We're in it right now. Christ is putting his enemies under his feet. He has dominion. We have a commission. It is spiritual/heavenly and on earth.
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @ejioforkel @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien Now if you want to know what God wrote through the Apostle John, and if you have ears to hear it, pay close attention: John wrote during "THE TRIBULATION"
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @ejioforkel @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien John writes "tē [the] thlipsei [tribulation]"
I'm sorry you have a bad translation :(
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ejioforkel @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien I don't know what position you think you're arguing against. I'm at a loss for words.
@MascotUr @lisasharper Now if you are native, and not some white person with guilt to atone for, you would know what song it is and you would know perfectly well that banging a drum in the face of a white boy while singing the American Indian Movement song is not a friendly gesture.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ejioforkel @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien Two points. First, you don't understand the Kingdom of God, because if you did you wouldn't describe it like a zealot. Secondly, Paul was talking about it to the pagans as well, which destroys your whole methodology, because if you were right then Paul would not bring it up.
@MascotUr @lisasharper English is the only language that distinguishes between the two. In most languages a song is a chant and a chant is a song, but if you want to be superficial I can't stop you :)
@higham_mark @ejioforkel @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @pbcmike98 @BWSchank @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien Same to you!
@higham_mark @ejioforkel @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @pbcmike98 @BWSchank @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien All the Paul-Onlyists/Mid-Acts Dispensationalists never want to address Acts 28: He lived there two whole years at his own expense, and welcomed all who came to him, proclaiming the KINGDOM OF GOD and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 It proved Jesus wasn't a false prophet and the Old Covenant was over.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Nobody took him literally or they would have built the temple according to his specifications. Also, wasn't there something about a river  flowing out of the temple? How are they going to create a river? It's symbolic.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 What year did it start? What year did it end? Does the number equal 70? You're assuming that Daniel has the same modern western understanding of numbers as you do.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I asked for the math where two years are provided and the difference between the two is exactly 70.
@kanyabwile Do you understand the cultural significance of beating a drum in the face of someone while singing the AIM (American Indian Movement) chant? Under no conceivable circumstance could it not be considered incredibly provocative. That boy was ritualistically dunked on.
@HectorCannabis @lisasharper Deflection? I have no idea what your point is or even if you're trying to make sense or if I should even care.
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Are you referring to Acts 16?
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I'll see if I can my hands on it
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 No
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled as they followed the beast.
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The Roman Empire broke out into Civil War after the death of Nero. People thought that it was the end of the empire until Vespasian took over started the Flavian dynasty.
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It was the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 There is no escape. There is no refuge. The wicked have no where to hide from the face of Him who sits on the Throne and from the wrath of the lamb
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The Roman empire collapsed during this time.
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The New Covenant was an earthquake stronger than any other since man was on the earth
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Well if that's the case stop calling yourself a Christian. Christ = Messiah.
@RedeemedRutland You can get the kids out but now you've got the old man with a breathing machine ruining his performance
@ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Now do you understand the difference between a prophetic vision described in the prophetic idiom and the historical accounts of Titus destroying the second temple?
@ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Ezekiel described the second temple in the prophetic idiom. In other words, Ezekiel described a temple so vast and huge that it could never be constructed, nor was it intended to be constructed according to his description. It was a vision. People understood that.
@ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Absolutely. It is a description of the second temple using the prophetic idiom, which is almost always absolutely never ever ever ever ever... ever to be taken like a wooden literalist.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 But did WWII happen before the second temple was destroyed?
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 That goes without saying, but scripture has a multitude of genres. You need to recognize the genre when reading scripture
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 * "there" = Dali Museum
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I know it well. I'm from there. One of my old roommates still works there I think.
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Well here's a warning: what you're going to see there might look as realistic in form as a Rembrandt, but it's in a different genre that uses symbolism and you shouldn't look at a Dali the same way you look at a Rembrandt
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The bible says Jesus is the door. Chew on that with your wooden literalism.
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Wow, I'd like to show you some Salvador Dali paintings and see if your head explodes
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The Messiah, the Prince, came and cut a new covenant with many and with his own sacrifice put an end to the old sacrificial system and his body was an atonement for sin. Then the second temple was destroyed. How is this not clear?
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The Messiah is the Prince. Why are you waiting for the second temple to be destroyed?
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 No you do not take the bible literally because if you took the bible literally then you would not read the prophetic idiom like the encyclopedia.
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Internal evidence point to the second temple still standing. External evidence point to the time of Nero
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Do you really think the moon is going to turn into blood?
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 "We have no king but Caesar!"
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Yes they did.
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Yes there was.
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I agree.
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Irenaeus is wrong.
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Daniel 9:27 is about Jesus, not the antichrist
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The prince is the messiah
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Agreed. He spoke of the second temple being destroyed. The apostles asked when. Jesus said a number of things would happen, including the abomination of desolation, and that wicked generation would see the second temple destroyed.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Seriously, I could be wrong. If you're confident it is precisely 70 years, then I'm open to see how you get there.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Do the math. I don't know how you get the exact number 70.
@HectorCannabis @lisasharper "Nice Cherry Pick"? Is that the name of your new strain? I quit smoking. Thanks for the offer though.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 TBH I trusted a teacher who presented this bad math too when I first became a Christian. When I realized the math didn't add up, it turned me against that teacher and made me distrust everything he ever said, and it turns out it was one of his lesser bits of misinformation.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Listen, I know there is a lot of bad "experts" out there telling you that Daniel's prophecy adds up like a mathematical formula and this makes a great apologetic tool, but I suggest not lying to people about math. Teach them doctrine, then the prophetic genre.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If Daniel was making a wooden literalist point he would have said 490 years, but he didn't. Instead he put it in a strange way made up exclusively in terms of highly symbolic numbers. I suggest doing a word study of 70 and 7
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If you want to understand how this symbolism is interpreted in ancient Hebrew culture, then I suggest looking at a non-canonical work called the Book of Jubilee. It clearly shows that people of that time would see the weeks in terms of eras marked by creation and rest.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 No. I think prophecy is primarily symbolic and points to a spiritual reality more than a wooden literal reality. In prophetic terms 70 is not 69+1 or 71-1. It's 70. 70 weeks of years is not 70 * 7 = 490. It's symbolic multiplied by symbolic.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Yes, 445 was to rebuild the walls. The walls rebuilt with the help of strangers as the prophecy said would happen.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The city was already built
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 445 is just to rebuild the walls
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 ... which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of the Lord, the God of Israel—he is the God who is in Jerusalem.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 “Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever is among you of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem...
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing:
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 See here's the thing: numbers in ancient cultures, especially in Hebrew culture, are not seen as modern western man sees numbers, in which the number 7 is simply one more than 6 and one less than 8. They have symbolic power.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 And if you want to take Jeremiah's prophecy about seventy years captivity, then you could take the beginning of captivity at 597 BC and subtract 70 and get 527 BC. Well the captivity ended in 539 BC.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 That's not what Ezra 1 says
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Well if you want to take Daniel's prophecy as a wooden literalist does, then you would take 539 BC (the date of Cyrus' decree) and subtract 490 and get 49 BC.
@lisasharper With all due respect, the song was not an improvised song. It was the AIM (American Indian Movement) Chant. There's no conceivable scenario where beating that particular song in the face of anyone could be confused as a sign of peace. It's 100% provocative.
RT @Kdubtru: 😂😂😂 https://t.co/9gDfGEtyRr
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Have you wondered that Daniel may not have been making a mathematical equation  but rather a theological point?
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I think is was about 539 BC. Now 539 BC - 490 (7 * 70) is not 32 AD, April or otherwise. How does your math work?
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 What year was the decree?
@pattonoswalt Can we start a thing called #NathanPhillipsing? It is super easy: Go up to children at bus stops and bang drums in their faces until people start calling you a hero

@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I am not gonna argue with that :)
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I know the stuff you're saying is a very popular way of looking at prophecy today, but I sincerely believe these ideas are spread by false teachers who come up with sensationalist ideas to sell books. Our eschatology should not be determined by newspaper clippings.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You must also understand that the prophetic idiom is not the same way we talk with our friends in 2019. It's a specific genre with a specific way of going beyond the mere physical, not to exaggerate like a fisherman describing a big fish, but to show the spiritual importance
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Am I wasting my time talking to a parody account or are you for real?
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Are you kidding me?
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Please give up on the methodology. God gives a promise and fulfills it. He doesn't say he's going to do something within a generation and do it thousands or millions of years later.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 God determines it to show His power. All this talk of huge strings of unfulfilled prophecies would be of no use to anyone. It is not His fault people aren't aware of history.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Antiochus Epiphanes led an army made up of many nations. These things happened during the intertestimental period.
@ThaRealJgibbs @ejioforkel @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Did you read the comment I made just below the one you just commented on?
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Who is teaching you to read prophecy? Are you learning this stuff from rabbis?
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The exception are Messianic prophecies, and those have been fulfilled.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Here's the gist: God doesn't generally give prophecies that are an insanely long period in the future without saying something like "seal up this prophecy" or something similar to make it clear that it is a long time away.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Yes, read Nehemiah. The King of Susa helps build the walls.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Again, 539 BC
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Again. 539 BC
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Ezekiel 34-37 is about restoration and peace; 38-39 is about a period of tribulation ushered by Antiochus Epiphanes
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 That's a messianic prophecy fulfilled in Christ.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Please, please, please do not say that Isaiah 60 is about airplanes.
Yes! A stranger built the walls!
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Hosea has the same structure. The people were wicked and shall be punished but God will show mercy on them.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Isaiah 60 is about the restoration of Israel. Again 539 BC.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Isaiah 49 is about the restoration of Israel. Again 539 BC
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The bible doesn't give that specific information. You're making a historical argument. I'm telling you what we know about from historical records.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Joseph lived in the north because he was a skilled craftsman working on a building project. His ancestral home was in the south. However, most of Jesus' neighbors would have been from the 10 tribes. They owned the lands.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The ones that remained were intermarried with the pagans. The ones who left returned with the rest. Who do you think Jesus' neighbors were?
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 From a quick scan these all already happened. What's your issue?
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Many individuals became known as the Samaritans by intermarrying.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I asked for one. Please give me one. Now don't point me to something written during the Babylonian exile that prophecies the return in 539 and say it is not fulfilled.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Have you read Ezra? It's about the return.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It was written during the Neronic persecutions in the 60s
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I'm trying to be open minded, but I am not sure where you are coming from. Could you please name one of the supposedly hundreds of unfulfilled prophecies?
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Most of Jesus' disciples were from the 10 northern tribes.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 They did.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 John wrote that in the 60s. The temple was still standing then.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 That's a dishonorable use of the text. The text was about what was happening then.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I'm talking about the nation. It was gone. Certainly not every individual of the nation was killed. The early church in Jerusalem fled to the mountains just like Jesus warned them to do when they saw the armies surround the city.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Are you asking if every single individual returned, then no. Did they return? Yes.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Those were horrible events, but what happened in 70 AD was the end of the old world order. It was massive.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I don't know what you mean about the application. This is a prophecy that played out in history. God punished the northern kingdom who were captured and dragged off. Same with the southern kingdom.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Israel was annihilated. The city was destroyed. The temple was destroyed. The people were dragged off into slavery. Corpses were left with burial for the birds to eat. The country no longer existed.
@higham_mark @ejioforkel @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Yep. Jeremiah is all about offering negative sanctions of exile with one hand and future hope of restoration with the other hand. Ezekiel too.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It was annihilated. Did you know some big event happened in 70 AD?
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Jeremiah is talking about the return to the land in 539 BC. To make it about anything else is to not honor the text.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Israel return? What are you talking about? Matthew 24 is about the annihilation of Israel.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Did you notice that when discussing the Fig Tree Christ says: "Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place." That generation already passed away. Those things took place. If you don't see that maybe you are misinterpreting it.
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Simple. Jeremiah wrote about the return of the people from Babylonian exile and that occurred in 539 BC.
@ThaRealJgibbs @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 My point is you're now sounding like a preterist.
@Swtladee @Lex_Lutheran "Native Twitter has gone ablaze as a Native American elder singing the  AIM Song in Washington DC during the Indigenous Peoples March was  ridiculed, taunted and mocked by a group of non-Native youth." https://t.co/bfLjNBP0WN
@Swtladee @Lex_Lutheran LOL it's actually a pretty cool chant that is pretty popular. Indian Country Today also confirmed that it's the AIM chant.
@Lex_Lutheran @Swtladee ... The elder was likely part of that movement, and I am not just  speculating. The song he's chanting is the AIM chant. AIM was the group  dedicated to provocation for media coverage. Perhaps they've changed their approach in more recent times, but I'm guessing not.
@Lex_Lutheran @Swtladee I got an MA in colonial history with a focus on Native studies, but we learned about more contemporary issues, and I hate to say it but a lot of the 70s era activism was 100% aimed at taking real issues and provoking potentially violent confrontations for media coverage...
@higham_mark @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 God question! And was the Apocrypha "given by inspiration of God" when it was being translated for the KJV?
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Listen, I thought you wanted a non-RCC translation, but the KJV translators kept a lot of the Vulgate's mistakes because they were popular misconceptions. Not my problem.
@MonasticMystic @Lex_Lutheran @Swtladee The first reports I heard made it out like they were a roving pack of street tuffs looking to start stuff, but then I saw a video of what looks like kids at the bus stop waiting for their school bus to pick them up to leave the March for Life event.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Are you that attached to the Latin Vulgate?
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Although it cleaned up some of the more obvious issues, e.g., the Jeremiah vs. Epistle of the Hebrews covenant vs testament distinction, the translators did not go far enough. I'm guessing it would have ruffled of the feathers of some of the Anglican liturgical ceremonies.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The KJV translation team was apparently more interested in maintaining the continuity of this bad translation than have coherent continuity within scripture. It was a bad call.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 "Testamentum Novum" is where the phrase New Testament that we use in everyday discussion today for speaking of Christian books of our Bible. It is based on a bad translation of the New Covenant that became so widely accepted that it can't possibly be done away with.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Another example, when the Vulgate translated Jeremiah 31 it uses the word pactum for the covenant, but when the Jeremiah passage is quoted in the 8th chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews it uses the testamenti or more specifically "testamentum novum"
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 ... When translating the Greek, the translators preferred testamenti even when referring to things in the OT it previously translated as pactum. For instance, circumcision was a sign of the testamenti in the NT and pactum in the OT. It thus created a false discontinuity.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The KJV error likely stems from an over reliance on the Vulgate, who were the first to introduce this covenant (pactum)/testament (testamenti) distinction in translating the Hebrew and Greek...
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The "the end" was the end of the old covenant order: symbolic atonement, sacrificial system, temple worship, pilgrimages to Jerusalem, the old covenant, the waiting for the messiah, etc., etc.. Daniel is writing about the end of all that.
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Was the sacrificial system ended? What else are you waiting for?
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Check your math
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Did the messiah form a new covenant with many? Was the messiah seemingly left with nothing after being cut off? Did the messiah atone for sins? Was Jerusalem destroyed?
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Are you still waiting for the messiah to be cut off and the temple to be destroyed?

@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The whole week way of describing it makes the "pause" theory not credible. When do you believe the pause started?
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 That's a problem if you want to understand scripture.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 There is no consistency. The KJV was made up of translation teams. Some apparently preferred one word over the other, but the end result of their team effort is a product of confusion.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 To be completely honest, I don't know how this is even up for debate unless you mistake "the end" for the end of the universe, which is a big, big, big interpretive mistake.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 During the Babylonian exile, we had specific prophecy about the return and when it would occur. Not so with 1948.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If I didn't understand how covenants work I might confused by it, but then we'd have to change the meaning of everlasting.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 There is no gap. The temple was destroyed.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If it is a testament, it changes nothing other than to confuse people by introducing a weird translation. What is a testament? A covenant. What is a feature of a covenant? Continuity. What does a testament provide? Continuity of inheritance to an elected people.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So God promised them to multiply and enter the land of Canaan. Then there's this part about possessing it, which historically did not happen. I understand why that didn't happen. It relates to understanding the nature of covenant.
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 By all means, advance your case, but I suggest not working backwards from a 1611 English translation to the Greek where you might get tripped up by a word that is similar in the English translation, but not related in the Greek.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I am the one talking about Daniel. I don't think Mark said anything about it.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 All these texts work together. Christ is the one who brought the new covenant. He established the Lord's Supper as a sign of the covenant that Daniel said would be cut just prior to being cut off himself.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Christ refers to this explicitly in Matthew 24. He claimed to be that Messiah, who would cut a new covenant with the many and be cut off to seemingly have nothing and then the temple would be destroyed.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Now compare this Mat 26:28 to Daniel 9 about the Messiah cutting a new covenant with many for the forgiveness of sin prior to being cut off and the temple being destroyed.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 "And he gave him the covenant (diathēkēn) of circumcision" (Acts 7:8)

"for this is my blood of the covenant (diathēkēs), which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." (Matthew 26:28)
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Do you have any evidence that the Greek word for "testimony" was used during the last supper or is it always the Greek word for covenant?
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If that's not what you're saying, then why bring up Revelation 19? It's a different word. Perhaps I am missing your point.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Could you do me a favor and tell where the unconditional covenant with Jacob is mentioned?
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You've been saying that the word for a person's account means the same thing as the word for covenant when you feel like that's how you want to interpret it.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 When the NT refers to it though?
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So would you say when male kids were circumcised it was a sign of a testimony?
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 When Christ refers to the Lord's supper he uses the word diathéké for covenant. It is the same word for what was delivered to Abraham and Moses
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Josh showed me that a testimony is not the same as a covenant but nobody thought they were since the NT writers used two different words for each
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Future?
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So we live in the new testament, not the new covenant even though they are exactly the same word? Very clever :)
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Rev 19 is not referring to covenant (diathéké). It refers to a testimony (martyrian). It is where we get the word martyr
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Why didn't the writers of the NT distinguish? Paul was known for inventing a new word when the occasion called for it. Why not here?
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So there is no new covenant if the KJV only translates the word for covenant as testament?
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The IF is all the believing ones
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Same word. It is not the best translation but it is fine as long as you speak of an Abrahamic testament and a Mosaic testament and a Davidic testament etc
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It is not an either or. A will is a covenant. Look to Daniel who said the messiah would cut a new covenant with many and be cut off. Testament is a double word play because it had to do with Christ's death but it is still a covenant
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It is the same word in the Greek :)

@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Why? The author to the Hebrews said all that was passing away. And why did Paul preach the kingdom in Acts 28? I keep asking you this but you never answer.
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It is kind of odd. Jesus preached the temple would be destroyed
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 In other words the truth changes for different ethnic groups?
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So 2+2=4 depending on the ethnicity of the person you are talking to?
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Acts goes up about 62 or 63 I believe. Paul was beheaded a few years later. That is not a big window
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You said Peter, John, and James led the churches in Asia astray, right?
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Both were written around the same time, 60s
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So Peter and James and John are in hell for spreading a false gospel?
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You call us cold because we hold to election, but your narrow warped definition of the gospel is held by so few people that you end up sending more people to hell then the most cage stage Calvinist
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You are being evasive. You have made it clear that virtually all churches do not have the "true" gospel so they aren't saved. Heaven must be roomy
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Who had the true gospel in the 4th century?
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Not joking. Virtually all Christians are repulsed by your theology and your understanding of the gospel. You would consider them all to be mixing law and gospel and worthy of hellfire
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Since people have not arrived any where close to you until very recently and there might be a thousand people who agree with you then most Christians since the beginning have not believed what you consider to be the true gospel. They are in hell, correct?
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Your definition of the gospel has been held by less then a thousand people
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 99.999999999999999% of Christians reject your view of Paul's theology including Paul himself. If you are right Paul is in hell
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Nobody thought anything remotely close to dispensationalism until very recently and if dispensationalism is the gospel then 99.9999% of Christians are in hell

@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Well you do not think anyone in the early church did. You do not anyone in the Roman church did, nor eastern church, nor reformation. So when did people start going to heaven?
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You act like everyone went to hell until mid Acts dispensationalism came around. Not true
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 God will judge his heart. If it turns out that he never converted then he did great things for the church by legalizing our faith. It was an answer to many prayers

@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 We also know he professed Christ and was baptized and you question his faith. I do not know where you get that right

@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Look at the passion they had for Christ compared to you who won't even get into a vehicle and drive to church.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You're deflecting again. So unbelieving gentiles knocked down unbelieving gentile temples to build churches for other unbelieving gentiles? In what world does that make sense?
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Now who was in control of Jerusalem?
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 333: The Eleona Basilica is built on the Mount of Olives, marking the site of the Ascension of Jesus.
335: First Church of the Holy Sepulchre built on Calvary.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 326: Constantine's mother Helena visits Jerusalem and orders the destruction of Hadrian's temple to Venus which had been built on Calvary. Accompanied by Macarius of Jerusalem, the excavation reportedly discovers the True Cross, the Holy Tunic and the Holy Nails.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 c. 325: The ban on Jews entering the city remains in force, but they are allowed to enter once a year to pray at the Western Wall on Tisha B'Av.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 A significant wave of Christian immigration to the city begins. This is the date on which the city is generally taken to have been renamed Jerusalem.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 324–25: Emperor Constantine wins the Civil Wars of the Tetrarchy (306–324) and reunites the empire. Within a few months, the First Council of Nicaea (first worldwide Christian council) confirms status of Aelia Capitolina as a patriarchate...
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Who controlled it then?
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Given their own idolatry, it is no wonder they did not succeed.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Let me help you out while you go off into a totally different tangent: the Crusades were about RETAKING Jerusalem. They had it. They lost it. It was under their control.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Rome let the Muslims take it because they had a beef with the Byzantines.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Byzantine Empire
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 What do you think the Crusades were about?
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It was Christian land. They planted churches. They went on pilgrimages to it. It was theirs.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Your endless string of unfulfilled prophecies is ridiculous. You're one degree of separation of still waiting for the Messiah to be born.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You can't even seem to resolve the issue without creating more issues. I'm not going to let you forget this. You have solved nothing. In fact, it is a very clear illustration about how bankrupt your system is when it is forced to take in all the words instead of skip over them.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 There are earthly repercussions for sin. Now don't change the subject. The Church controlled that land for quite some time. That's why there are super old churches there.
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If you're not part of God's people, then you're damned.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The apostle John wrote during the tribulation
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Or why Paul spoke about the Kingdom to gentiles. Or why Paul taught baptism to gentiles. Or why the Church is called terms normally applied to Israel. Or why the Church brought YAHWEH's name to the world and not Israel.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You haven't explained why church discipline hearings (two or three witness) is the same exact formula as Israel's legal proceedings. Or why Paul told Christian children to obey the fifth commandment. Or why the Church had the same responsibility to care for widows as Israel
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 And do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father,’ for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 But you have a false sense of clarity based on ignoring continuity. We've illustrated this time and time again. Just from the other day, you still haven't explained why Paul taught former pagans to partake in the Lord's Supper when it is supposed to be for the Jewish Jetsons.
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Who here is a gentile?
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 What promises?
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The Church already did take over that land. Idolatry became widespread and God sent the Muslims to punish them. Sound familiar? Yeah, that's what God did to Israel with Babylon. That's what God does to the Church.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If the Church is not chosen then it is damned.
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Hmm perhaps. My knee jerk reaction is to worry that it blurs the creator-creature distinction, but I suppose there could be a case for that view under a headship approach. What benefit/implications does it have?
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Are you asking about the traditional Talmudic interpretation of the Godhead?
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It matters a great deal to your boy Knox. It's the basis of everything he's saying.
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 * was = has
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I'm not denying what you're accusing me of denying. God elects His people. He was one people.
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The administration can change forms. The manner of fulfillment can change forms, but there's one people of God. Israel was a continuation of a continuation of a continuation. Some people get cut off along the way.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Okay, so why interpret every reference to the Godhead as being a reference to the Father alone?
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I'm talking about Christ.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I am led to guess that's what you believe because your boy Knox apparently just sees any reference to God and assumes that it is about the Father.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I'm sorry, but your system has you going into grotesque places. I'm not talking about the bride metaphor. I'm talking about what you do to the Trinity. Do you guys even believe the second person of the Trinity existed prior to the incarnation?
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Christ is true Israel. In order to understand this point you need to stop thinking like a modern westerner trying to do a crude mathematical equation.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Paraphrase: "You can't have Israel married to the father and the church married to Christ and have the church be Israel because you can't have one bride married to a father and His son, that's gross!"
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Not at all. What I hear when you say Israel and the Church is not an apparently obvious statement. I hear the implications that you draw from it. You are putting the Trinity into Civil War.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Why is it so unbelievable that someone can understand the argument and not agree with it? The man believes in weird living on different planet stuff. It is not even close to credible.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I haven't made myself suffer through listening to your boy Knox much, but he is definitely dechristening scripture. His view of the Trinity is warped (to put it nicely). Listen closely to what he says: he has Christ's mission and the Father's mission to be totally distinct.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Christ says that scripture is about him, not Israel. Your dechristening of scripture is incredibly concerning.
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So the point of scripture is not really about Christ, it's about Israel? Got it.

@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It is a simple question. Do you own it?
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So you do not disagree with the assessment?
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It was not a compliment
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 This is why people say you have an Israelcentric method
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Thank you! Someone needed to ask it!
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 But won't they be discouraged when they realize he makes stuff up with a straight face?
RT @bkben3: https://t.co/80FGqQhzpz
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 He's going for strawmen in the title alone before he even says a word. Then he immediately goes into rapture fever. Please, why? Why? Why?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 He thinks that people who do not hold to a Israelphile view of scripture believe that the church is the physical seed of Abraham? Why is he saying these things? Who takes him seriously?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I'm not being contrarian. I sincerely with all my heart believe that you are completely wrong on this subject. Your video has a strong start if the goal is to make stuff up. Please find another teacher.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I don't get why a supposed Christian has the same hermeneutic as a Jewish Nationalist who can't understand the difference between bloodline and covenant
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So when you think about the Lord's Supper your mind goes straight to Israel? This is why you are accused of being Israelcentric rather the Christocentric
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Do you feel yourself unworthy of the promise because of your bloodline? Well let me share the gospel with you! You too can partake in the covenant of promise regardless of your bloodline! The message of the Jewish messiah is going out to the whole world! All to the glory of God!
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Before the great commission, non-Jews were "strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world" and now you know about YAHWEH but you wish to remain a stranger to the covenant of promise. Does that seem odd?
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If you guys are going to make some big distinction between the same Greek word (diathéké) whether it should be translated as testament or covenant, then you guys should figure out which applies to this "dispensation" and which is just for the Jewish Jettsons.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Paul: "our sufficiency is from God, who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit." 2 Cor. 3
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You're on the outside
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The lamb that takes away sin. What's that about?
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 What about Adam? Was a he a Jew as well? You've got some bad sources.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Was Noah a Jew? A son of Abraham?
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Then go back to Daniel. The Messiah would form a New Covenant with many and be cut off.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You sacrifice an animal for a covenant. You spill its blood and you eat its flesh. Where have I heard that before? Oh yeah, the Lord's Supper
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 What do you think a covenant involved? The death of an animal.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It's the same word in Greek!
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Same word dude.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Surely, you feel the weight of this issue on your entire system. I suggest giving it some serious thought and prayer.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Why? Is this the New Covenant?
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Hmm that is interesting isn't it?
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Is that your argument for not obeying a specific command from our LORD and from your favorite Apostle?
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So did Christ return and that justifies not practicing the Lord's Supper? Did Paul forget that it was just supposed to be a Jewish thing like you said? Paul apparently isn't as good at "rightly dividing" as you are!
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Nope, but there's 100% continuity between what Christ said to the 12 and what Paul told the former pagans in Corinth.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So even if Paul's letters are flawed (i.e., not infallible) by the misconception of when Christ would return, it would not explain why he was spreading the practice among non-Jews. You've got a problem any way you look at it.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You said that gentiles should not be participating in the Lord's Supper because they are not part of the New Covenant, because the NC is only for Jews. Why is Paul spreading it to the gentiles?
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 We are told perform the sign of the New Covenant in the form of the Lord's Supper from the time of the Last Supper until he returns.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If gentiles were doing things they should not have been doing Paul would have freaked out and said something like I wish they drank themselves to death.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So Paul was telling Jewish women to act modest like Jews but he forgot to make that known in his letter that it was just for the Jewish women? Your method makes not sense.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You said the New Covenant is for Jews only and the Lord's Supper is a sign of the New Covenant and Paul taught the former pagans to observe it. How does that make sense?
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So Paul was a Judaizer because you think some Jews were in Corinth?
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 LOL where was Paul to call Paul out for being a hypocrite like Paul did to Peter. You're not making sense.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 According to you Paul would be judiazing the former pagans by telling them to observe the Lord's Supper.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So why did Paul teach the former pagans in Corinth to observe it? Why?
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The New Covenant is the post-resurrection administration of God's covenant that was announced first to the Jews and then to the gentiles
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 That's what Christ told the 12. That's what Christ told Paul to tell the church. You can't process this information because your dispy slogan won't let it compute.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Paul taught them to observe it! Paul taught them it is a sign of the New Covenant! He said we should celebrate it for the same reasons Jesus told the 12 to celebrate it. Address this issue.
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 And you still haven't explained why Paul was teaching the former pagans to observe the Lord's Supper.
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Yes, yes, I know they were all Jewish, but Christ said the supper should be practiced as a sign of the New Covenant until he returns, not after.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You guys need to have meeting and figure out what is going on with the Lord's Supper (a sign of the New Covenant) is being practiced in a dispensation that it shouldn't be practiced in, and why Paul was practicing it in Corinth among former pagans. It's all very strange.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 But that's for the New Covenant after all the Christians get beamed out and the world goes full Nicolas Cage and the Jews start New Covenant. What's going on?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Do you celebrate the Lord's Supper?
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Don't go full Nicolas Cage https://t.co/1nGYXFa2iq
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I'm sorry, but I'm not going to let this go. You have to deal with it.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Well obviously you want to deflect with jokes, but when you get some time give it some thought.
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 What are you talking about? If Jesus told the 12 to do it, and Paul told the non-Hebrews to do it, and it is a sign of the New Covenant, then what on earth are you talking about the New Covenant being a futuristic, Jewish only thing?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 And none of that got through to you? It's just bouncing off you like nothing. Paul said to put on the full armor of God, not the full armor of dispensationalism.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Thanks for supporting my point :)
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I'm still lost. Did I lead you to believe that some country called Israel did not exist as a geopolitical entity? I never said that.
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 This single illustration alone should put an end to your weird futuristic divisions and prove conclusively once and for all that mid-Acts dispensationalism does not "rightly divide"
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Paul was writing to the church about performing the sign of the New Covenant. The former pagan non-Hebrews living in Corinth participated in it. The Hebrew Christians participated in it. It is a sign of what binds us all together in the New Covenant.
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This  cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it,  in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink  the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Paul writes: For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”...
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 This makes it crystal clear the continuity between Jesus' message to the 12 and Paul's message to the church and that the New Covenant is now. You have to be invested into a serious error not to see it.
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Paul told the Corinthians to partake in the signs of the new Covenant telling the church to perform this sign "until he comes."
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Who is denying that? We have access to news media.
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The Last Supper is proof of the New Covenant being instituted
@higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I have no idea what his point is.
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 That's not what I'm saying. I have never said anything that could lead you to insinuate that. Our mission has not changed: bring the gospel to the whole world.
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 God sure is sending a lot of His favorite people in the world to hell for hating His son. Kind of odd, don't you think?
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 There's no such thing as a suspended covenant. That's is analogous to a divorce. A divorced couple are not in a covenant union. Romans 11 speaks of a prophetic restoration.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I know your position is that Jesus is going to sit on a thrown in Jerusalem and sort out all the injustice in the world by hearing complaints 24/7, which he being in the flesh can't possibly do so he'll have to set up some giant bureaucracy to run things for him. Not buying it.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It's a prophecy about covenant restoration into the covenant community.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Scripture has nothing specific to say about 1948 just as scripture has nothing to specific say about the Crimean War. It's just God's decree moving forward in time. Our mission has not changed one bit.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Yes, and then they will enter the New Covenant community, which is the only thing that matters.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 What are you talking about? It's a country of unbelievers, who are more or less incredibly hostile to Christianity, who are surrounded by other countries incredibly hostile to Christianity. What is your obsession?
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 How?
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I didn't say you were in Israel. Israel is over. It is covenantally dead. There's God and His covenantal people. It's that simple. People are grafted into communion with God, not people. Please try to understand this point.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 There is no Israel
@BWSchank @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 "Believing Israel" means nothing. Are you covenantally alive or are you covenantally dead? That's the question. Christ brought the New Covenant. If you don't get on board, you're covenantally dead.
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Apostates were snapped off. The point is theocentric, not Israel centric.
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 To the people of God. The covenant people. The sons of Israel were grafted into that body of believers. Gentiles were grafted in as well.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 I agree 100%. God has a decree.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 Nobody says anything about arm twisting. A heart undergoing regeneration naturally gravitates towards God.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 LOL I wouldn't put it that way. Evidence only becomes convincing if you have a softened heart. God does the softening. I heard all the evidence before. It is super easy to dismiss if you want to dismiss it. There's a reason it's called faith.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 Could you give a specific example?
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 I can relate to his experience.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 Well that's good for the congregation. I've heard that tension is a common though. Those were anecdotes, but I've heard enough of them to make a mental note.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 Very true. It is both a string and percussion. I think more people on the street would think of it in terms of beat vs melody though.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 By God's providence, I got this very strange notion in my head that I hadn't had in a while: I wanted to know more. Atheists have this weird delusion that they understand scripture more than believers, and I wanted to freshen up on my critique. That's about when God flipped me.
@AddieMiller0330 @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 Can you give one specific example?
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 I had heard the gospel hundreds of times before then. I thought it was absurd and the people offering it were absurd. It repulsed me. At the time of my conversion I hadn't been witnessed to in years.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 I was a militant atheist, who hated Christianity and Christians. I would describe it as God's work that manifested itself both gradual and sudden. Sort of like the straw that broke the camel's back, but in my case it was the gradual softening of the heart
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 I've shared it on this tread already.
@bkben3 I thought this was a generally accepted fact. Amill wasn't even a term until about 1915. Prior to that all amills were considered postmills. I think it has 100% to do with the Zeitgeist of post-WWI era pessimism.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 The idea of making worship "cool" or treat it as an evangelistic tool is very suspicious to me. Worship is for believers. It isn't to cater to unbelievers.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 I personally don't see it as a big deal or something to be legalistic about. It's more about sincerely trying to honor God and worship in a way that would not be a New Covenant version of "strange fire" innovations.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 The piano is a string instrument. God likes string instruments in worship whether it is on earth or in heaven. The NT did not abolish string instruments.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 No. That's a primitive baptist thing.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 Also worth mentioning: you're knowledge of church history needs some work. You are conflating Roman Catholic with catholic in the same breath that you almost acknowledge the distinction.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 We are catholic. The universal church. Not the individualistic anarchist reflection of a decadent American culture church.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 My pastor lives on church grounds. It is pretty humble. You guys seem to associate organized churches with these charlatans that seem to have taken over the "evangelical" world.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 I don't see the office of "worship leader" in scripture. It's a superfluous position. Many pastors I know outside of old school Presbyterianism have constant issues with the "worship team" either starting drama or getting off message into what people want to hear vs need to hear.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 We treat the youth like they are adults. Unless a baby can't stop crying or needs a diaper change they are with us. We sing songs from the Trinity Psalter Hymnal that usually reflects the passages we are studying. No fog machines. No drummer. No choir. Just us and a piano.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 I don't go to one of these non-denomination denomination mega churches. I think they are awful. We don't have a big screen or multi big screens. We don't have a sound system, although the mic does go to little speakers in a nursery for crying kids. We have a piano. No light show.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 We have no youth pastor. We have no worship leader.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 My pastor makes circa 30k.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 The pastor should be an elder. He's not Moses. He should have other elders who keep him in check. A presbytery made up of elders from numerous congregations should have oversight in case one congregation goes off the tracks.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 1. Nobody is forcing offerings. If your knee jerk reaction is to get defensive when the offering comes up, then you've got a problem. 2. I'm in favor of expository preaching, not topical preaching.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 Rome would most certainly not have approved of 1st century church structure. That's why there was a reformation. You seem to imply that because power was abused we should abandon the system God set up for our benefit.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 Galatians 6:  One who is taught the word must share all good things with the one who teaches.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 "Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor,  especially those who labor in preaching and teaching. For the Scripture  says, “You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain,” and,  “The laborer deserves his wages.”    1 Tim 5
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 That's your right just as it is Paul's right to deny wages. However, look at the Pastoral Epistles.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 First off, that's rubbish. Secondly, Jesus' references to two or three witnesses is from the Torah. Paul said the exact same thing. They set up the church as true Israel. This big sharp cut in the fabric of time isn't as clear cut as you seem to think.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 Okay, so you're opposed to the system of church organization that God set up and was spelled out via your only apostle Paul, especially in the pastoral epistles, and now you walk around like individualist Popes. How American!
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 God invented hierarchy. He's not an egalitarian. He has representatives on earth. The state is one. The family is one. The church is one. Our relationship with nature is one.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 I'm a traditional Presbyterian who subscribes to the regulative principle of worship. I don't believe in that stuff. I think they are dangerous.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 You are an antinomian anarchist playing cosplay Christian. Christ set up the church. Told it to the apostles. They set up the churches after Pentecost. Paul says the exact same things in the pastoral letters. You are on the outside.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 The organized body of believers under a plurality of leadership with rules for dealing with things.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 Agreed!
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 The little guy can appeal to the elders or take it to the presbytery to reign in an over zealous, unbiblical local leader, but wait, you don't believe in that so you've got no recourse. That stinks.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 ... For where two  or three  are gathered in my name, there am I among them.”

Look at the context. It's not about 2 guys calling themselves the church. It's about organized church authority and hierarchy. Now this is the point where you say that's a Jewish thing, right?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 ...

If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established...

@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 Bible studies are great, but they aren't worship. People gathered in houses under a form of church leadership. God is not an anarchist. Nor does he promote people getting egos and forming splinter house groups over adiaphora
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 Podcasts are nice, but they are not worship.
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 If you deny membership, then you deny church authority and hierarchy, which God introduced in the representational form of elders + deacons, who are to administer church discipline as God ordained representatives of Christ.
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 It's almost the same thing depending on the context. One is a member of the body of Christ, not a fellow, but members of the body have fellowship. Church hierarchy and authority is biblical. Collecting offerings is biblical.

@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 With some exceptions, church membership is generally a product of salvation. If your knee jerk reaction is to get turned off and defensive about church membership, you should ask yourself if it is God's way of shining a light on some sort of deficiency in your walk. Pray on it.

@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 I know this is tough for someone with a hard heart, but please listen. Salvation is Trinitarian. God transforms a person, meaning God transforms your appetites. A transformed person feels the NEED to go to Church like he feels the need to eat and drink. It's not work.
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 Dispensationalism is a confession

That doesn't sound right.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 You obviously don't have an appreciation of Church history. Augustine was writing during a transitional period in which he had aspects of catholicity as well as incipient Romanist concepts. Augustine needed reformation.
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 If you don't like fellowship with believers on earth, then you won't like it in the afterlife. You might hear "I never knew you"
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 The Romanist aspect should be called on to be reformed just as the eastern orthodox should be called on to be reformed, but the universal catholic church is nothing to be ashamed of.
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 We have a connection to the ancient universal (catholic) church along with its ecumenical doctrinal creeds. We are not afraid of history, nor do we deny history.
@NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 This dude goes on and on about this being "the church age," but he seems to be saying that he's not a real member of a real church under the authority of a real minister of a real church. He's his own fake Pope of his own fake church.
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @Valerie__Writes @PaulsWalls2 You are describing merit while at the same time insisting that it is not merit. I asked you not to play word games, but apparently that was asking too much.
RT @RevLouisBerkhof: The archetype of all covenant life is found in the Trinitarian being of God.
RT @RRuiz1689: https://t.co/4MHPSD9TZA
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @Valerie__Writes @PaulsWalls2 From our conversations you've made it abundantly clear that you heard the preaching of the gospel and you made the wise decision to have faith and because of this wise decision you merit salvation and the guy without faith doesn't merit salvation. Don't play with words.
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @Valerie__Writes @PaulsWalls2 Because we hold to the biblical view of monergism, in which regeneration procedes directly into saving faith, we are the only ones who can claim faith as a non-meritorious act of God's grace alone. What you have to do is play games with the definition of merit.
@PaulsWalls2 @Valerie__Writes @ReeFormedFaith @NahumOBrien Okay be evasive. You want the king to pardon you but you do not acknowledge him as king. That is just having knowledge. It is not being known though
@PaulsWalls2 @Valerie__Writes @ReeFormedFaith @NahumOBrien Savior and?
@PaulsWalls2 @Valerie__Writes @ReeFormedFaith @NahumOBrien Being in the body is being in the Covenant, which you reject. That means you know about the body. That's all.
@PaulsWalls2 @Valerie__Writes @ReeFormedFaith @NahumOBrien Christ shed blood for his sheep and you deny being one of those sheep. That makes you unknown
@PaulsWalls2 @Valerie__Writes @ReeFormedFaith @NahumOBrien I think anyone who rebels against entering into Covenant with the Triune God will not reap any benefits. In fact, you have enough knowledge that you heap up judgement by merely giving intellectual assent
@Valerie__Writes @ReeFormedFaith @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien They claim to be outside of the Covenant. They think the signs of the Covenant aren't for them, but there is no salvation outside the Covenant. What they have is knowledge. Knowledge outside of Covenant just means more judgement.
@Valerie__Writes @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 I like it when they interpret “God is no respecter of persons” at face value instead of looking up what the phrase "respecter of persons" actually means: Someone who treats people according to their social rank, status or importance.
@Valerie__Writes @ReeFormedFaith @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien I've never seen the militancy of KJV Onlyist fundamentalism and liberal antinomian easy-believism cohabit a single space like this before. It something to behold.

@b_dub9 @bkben3 @Lex_Lutheran @machenwarrior @Caleb_E_Keith I have no reason to assume, but I just kind of assumed that they were built by other denominations that closed down and were bought up. Some came with housing. Others didn't.
@b_dub9 @bkben3 @Lex_Lutheran @machenwarrior @Caleb_E_Keith That makes sense. There's a lot of diversity in architecture.
@machenwarrior @Lex_Lutheran @Caleb_E_Keith I'm not trying to be a hater, but I think that for most people not having to worry about spending circa half their income on housing would change the meaning of one's paycheck.

From "First Reformed," Rev Ernst Toller from a Dutch Reformed Church in upstate NY is descending into doubt about the sufficiency of the cross while his own personal political issue fills the vacuum to become his real hope for redemption.

@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You too. This has been fun, but I'm going to mute this convo now. Addressing all the errors would be a full time job. You guys are in too deep anyhow.

@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You're already playing dangerous games with scripture. Why not make make it worth it? Osteen is worth about $60M preaching his cheap grace, watered-down Christianity.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 What don't you get about people wanting your version of watered down Christianity?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Move to the big city. People would really eat up your message. It worked for Osteen.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Where did I lose you?
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Dude, you basically said telling people not to become Satanists is legalism in your view.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 What are you talking about? What you call "free grace" is the most worldly, fleshly, watered down thing calling itself Christianity today. If only you guys could get some light shows and smile more you could have mega churches like Joel Osteen or Joseph Prince.

@BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Everyone who rejects antinomianism is a legalist to you. Your compass is way off.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I didn't say he was a legalist. I'm saying all these antinomian IFB types turn into Lordshippers when one of their members brings his gay boyfriend. Then all a sudden they don't sound so antinomian anymore. All a sudden they start talking about people not inheriting the kingdom.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I see what you're doing. Cut the games.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 This whole IFB discussion was in response to the mention of Ruckman.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I can read whatever I want. Nobody cares. We aren't treated like little kids like IFBs treat their congregants.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I don't know how they can complain. The entire queer Christian movement is essentially consistent dispensationalism. The law of God doesn't matter anymore. Everyone is under grace. You just need faith. Why are dispys fruit checking because they go to gay bars?
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 The antinomian ones are the worst. They preach antinomianism and cheap grace all day long until one guy in their congregation brings his boyfriend and then they turn into HUGE Lordshippers talking about obedience to God's law. Funny how that happens.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I'm saying IFBs gross me out. I feel sorry for the people who are spiritually abused by these charlatans, who tell people not to read any books and to listen only to them. It's very cult-like.
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I'm sorry but IFBs gross me out. It's like an involuntary reflex.
@higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I saw that and cringed. Yuck! Paul, if you're just going to steal his argument, why not just scan it and put it here.
@higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 After telling Ezekiel that virtually nobody is going to listen to him, God commands him to "speak to them and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God,’ whether they hear or refuse to hear.” As such, Ezekiel is leveling blessings and curses. Jesus said shake the dust off your feet.
@higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 This is essential teaching. Hard hearts do not hear. God says "the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me: because all the house of Israel have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart." The heart needs transformation first.
@higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Paul is dipping into Ezekiel 3: "Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears." Isn't that an odd way of phrasing the process? It's almost like something happens in the heart first before real hearing can take place.
Wow, I just saw the film "First Reformed" (with Prime), and it is one of the most interesting films I've seen in a while. It is an illustration of how self-destructive people become when they try to fill what they perceive as God's silence with politics. https://t.co/WLmD2P08vy
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Yes. Yes.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I've already moved on. Unless anyone has any serious questions for me, I think all that can be said has already been said.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 We've been over this. I'm becoming bored of repeating myself so you can reply with a bunch of nonsense and mid-Acts slogans that doesn't address what I'm actually saying.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You seem to conflate reading "another man's opinion" with being forced to accept it. It's okay to read books that challenge your thinking. You don't have to be afraid. They aren't going to kill you.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 The issue is not that you cite scripture verses. It's that you manhandle them to the point where they can't be harmonized with other parts of scripture, which is why you have to come up with the Jewish George Jetson technique which doesn't even solve all your problems.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You and Schank are cookie-cutter mid-Acts dispensationalists. Paul might be as well. I'm not sure he's thought it through. Josh is a traditionalist dispensationalist of sorts without all the mid-Acts insanity.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It's not that you don't need to read them. It's that you don't want to read them. It's because you're from a culture that is hostile/afraid of reading other people.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You give too much credit to White. He didn't invent the "flattening out" phrase. It is actually a common phrase found in theology books, but you take pride in not reading theologians so you wouldn't know it.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It is because I consider your school of theology to be heretical. Why wouldn't I reject it?
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Compromised is a word that captures all those other words you listed plus more. My "obsession" is taking the whole council of God to avoid misrepresenting Him as a cartoon.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You are squishing everything down into a flattened out question of gettin' to heaven so when I say God disciplines people in this life you think I'm talking about something I am not talking about.
@ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Not even close. Go take a look at atheist twitter.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Simply getting the results of what they've done in the flesh is not going under the blessings heading. God disciplines people. He disciplines nations. He gives compromised Christians over to their enemies just as He gave compromised Israel over to their enemies.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 My evidence? Talking to you guys, talking to other fundies, hearing their sermons, seeing surveys of fundy attitudes towards learning, knowing the history.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You are avoiding the real thesis: if you make perseverance in faith an unnecessary work, then faith is optional five minutes after getting faith.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Fundies embrace a culture of anti-intellectualism which stems from their wider fear that the world is crumbling around them.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Result of the fall of the 1st Adam:

"I will put enmity between you and the woman,
    and between your offspring and her offspring;"

Messianic prophecy of future hope in the last Adam:

"he shall bruise your head,
    and you shall bruise his heel.”
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Christians get the curses and blessings. Look at the once faithful churches who God divorced. Look at the material blessings taken away from those who turn away. Look at the enemies getting the upper hand. God is still in control.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Are you referring to God announcing the decree of putting enmity between the people of the serpent and the people of God using the future sense, which is followed immediately in the very next chapter by the birth of Cain and Abel and the narrative about the enmity between them?
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Boasting of the power of God offends people at the fleshly level. They nitpick it. They change the subject. They disrupt the flow of scripture all in an effort to get out from under that fact. Then they blast those who proclaim it. It's not surprising in the least.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I boast of the power of God
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 If you consider persevering to be a work, then you are saying that you also consider faith five minutes after accepting an alter call to be completely optional.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Which is why all I get is "#SMH" from your camp when I bring up apostasy or even someone who appeared to everyone as OSAS who later became a Satanist. You simply shutdown and act like it is impossible or hypothetical.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Like I said: fundies do not like complexity. There is no born again new birth certificate you can frame and put on your wall. There is no official acceptance paperwork from God with your name on it with the "genuine" box checked rather than the "self deceived" box checked.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Jude is bringing attention to the fact that God does not send down a born again certificate. Some people hear a five star preacher man and get all frenzied and are bored of Christ a week later. Or throw in the towel under adversity. Fundies do not like complexity
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It is understandable to people who have the whole council of God
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I understand it. I just find it goofy and unacceptable
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I do not accept the idea that Jude wrote his letter to the Jewish George Jetson
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I reject your interpretation. It's too outlandish and idiosyncratic and novel. It is also completely unnecessary.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PauleyMo67 @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It's a historical narrative. There is no necessity to have some weird interpretation about hybrid DNA when a perfectly non-weird interpretation exists. I'm not sure how I can apply Genesis 6 to my life to be honest.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PauleyMo67 @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I understand that dispensationalists tend to take a DNA approach Genesis 6. I really, really, really don't want to go down that rabbit hole. Either way you look at it, it's still about covenant.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PauleyMo67 @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 There is no literal/physical seed of Satan. Some Rabbis had weird theories about that, but they are wrong. It's about who is your master: God or the serpent with the freewill gospel?
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Speaking of Jude. Did you notice how he prayed to God who has the power to keep the people from stumbling? It's almost like stumbling is under the sovereign decree of God too! Such an odd absence of modernist humanist thinking in Jude.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It is the same with fallen man. He needs to be regenerated to see the sweetness in the offer. Otherwise, it is just as repulsive to him as it is to his fallen angel counterpart.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You are not addressing the actual point. We are fallen now. You say we are affected by it, but not really. I doubt you'd say that a demon could hear a five star sermon and say "wow I have been super wrong, let me say a prayer and get faith." Not gonna happen. It repulses them.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PauleyMo67 @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 This is about covenant, not DNA.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Are we not talking about a fallen world?
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Read Romans 8 again. It says God foreknows people.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Then they fell and now they are demonic. Man did not sin at first and then man fell and now man is essentially demonic without the special grace of God.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I'm going to assume that you intended to have the form rather than the content be the focus here, i.e., you wanted to post a gif and not address what I actually said. So be it.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PauleyMo67 @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Are you trying to accurately represent what I've said? If so, you are way off base.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PauleyMo67 @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I am worried that this question is coming from a place of modernist humanism. Are those called and adopted as "sons of God" fully human?

@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Just as scripture describes the fallen angels as totally depraved, they are also described as being on a leash, which keeps them from acting as depraved as they inherently are. Fallen man is the same. God keeps fallen man on a leash to prevent us from destroying everything.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You say you acknowledge the fall with your mouth because it's impossible to miss it, but you want to soften it to the point where our minds aren't as naturally messed up and mentally enslaved as the demons. What separates us from them is God's transforming grace.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You seem to understand the nature of fallen angels. They are totally depraved, totally wicked. They reject God. They are never going to stop rejecting God. It's in their nature. Then when you start talking about fallen man you put on your rose colored glasses.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 This idea that you guys have that we are not affected by the fall in any serious way leads to your belief that we are neutral that natural man does not respond like a demon to the gospel prior to regeneration.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 We need to back it up a moment and get into the anthropology. We are fallen creatures not that different from fallen angels. We are born embodied demons instead of disembodied demons. We like demonic stuff. Then God redeems us with His grace and we become more angelic.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 And yet he was incurably wicked in the face of the awesome God of the universe, and all his descendants were even more wicked, and God destroyed everyone but one family who was not related to him.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Wow it sounds like Jesus saw the murder of Abel as something more significant than a local crime news report.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Please learn that real events can have symbolic meaning. The murder of Abel is not simply a local news report.
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 The children of God and the children of the serpent will be in conflict. Christ is the awaited savior
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It was a Messianic prophecy. The entire OT is filled with foreshadow and typology of that prophecy.
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Cain was never going to master sin. He had no inclination to master sin. Do you realize we are talking about a reprobate?
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Do you understand that something can be a foreshadow and be a real event at the same time?
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It is a foreshadow! How can you not see that?
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 If freewill is everywhere, then congrats! You found your true god. 

Cain had options. His hands crafted what his heart desired, which was dedicated to his father the serpent.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Did Cain actually master it? No. And the reason why is he was a son of the serpent. Mastering sin was not in his nature. Thus, there was inherent antithesis between him and Abel, which is why he murdered him.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 John writes: "We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one." Can you think of anyone else called the evil one? I'm sure you can. Well, Cain was his son, not literally, although some Rabbis entertained that idea.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 What bible am I reading? The same bible that presents Cain as the quintessential son of the serpent.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 "I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring." The offspring is not biological. It's like when Christ called his mockers the sons of Satan. Cain was the son of Satan. Therefore, for him to honor God would be against his nature.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Do you see the difference between the modern western humanist idea you're talking about and a non-mandatory offering?

@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 So you love your sins less then say Stephen Hawking? You chose God because you are better then him?
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 And if that is what you are saying then explain the difference between those who react positively vs negatively
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It sounds like you are saying that man's consciousness is not affected by sin and all he needs to hear is a five star sermon to rationally accept what Christians accept

@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Ezekiel prophecies about the construction of Temple II and you don't see it. Daniel prophecies about the destruction of Temple II and you don't see it. Jesus prophecies the destruction of Temple II and you don't see it. You are waiting for some big event that already happened.

@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Here's one of my critiques of dispensationalism: I never hear you guys ever talk about the role of the the second temple in prophecy either it's construction or destruction. Everything about the second temple is pushed into some futuristic era as temple 3.
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Thank you for the challenge, but like I said before, I don't have the technology to Skype. I have a Nook and a desktop. Also I'm not sure if it is my thing.
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I'll repeat. Some people are Calvinistic in their view of soteriology. Believe it or not, unlike today's contemporary Christian culture, Calvin was concerned about more than getting your ticket punched to heaven. I don't consider Piper to be reformed. Don't know about Mohler.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Read the work in its entirety. Notice the genre. Notice the literary devices. Notice the symbolism. Notice the representations. Notice the analogies. It's about the destruction of Temple I, exile, making of Temple II
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 So you can't even entertain the possibility that Ezekiel's vision was not a photograph?
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 That prophecy either already happened in a manner in which you haven't considered or it never will happen.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 When the zealots rose up they destroyed the records office with proof of tribal affiliation. There are no more 12 tribes. Nobody can prove they are this or that, and there's no way to reconstruct them either.
@higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I'm under the impression that that dispensationalist theology has essentially been an answer to Pharisaical objections to Jesus as the messiah. They essentially take their misconceptions and incorrect expectations and shove them into the future rather than correct them.

@Lex_Lutheran @brandon_adams @bkben3 The Americans took out a part about the civil magistrate's role in ecclesiastical matters in 1788 after splitting from England. I believe it was something along the lines of the head of state could call a church council to address an issue of concern.

@BWSchank @bajaturbo @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 This is yet another illustration of why you are accused of being a secular humanist ally
@BWSchank @bajaturbo @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 So blasphemy is just an issue of hurt feelings?
@BWSchank @bajaturbo @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Well somebody has got to rule. If you want to surrender that responsibility to God's enemies, then don't pretend it's a prophetic sign of the end times when it's judgement as a consequence of Christian escapism.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @bajaturbo @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 https://t.co/E84UsPP9KA
@BWSchank @bajaturbo @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Scripture defines the difference between a dead martyr and dead blasphemer.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Dispensationalists say that Satan is the king of kings and the rulers are subservient to him. Paul says that rulers are subservient to Christ, the King of kings, even if they do not acknowledge it.
@bajaturbo @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 A civic government not governed by Christians wouldn't care about blasphemy laws, which is why our society is becoming increasingly more and more blasphemous. Geneva, however, was governed by Christians.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Then what Paul says about civic leaders makes no sense. It is yet another example of how dispensationalsim confuses people.
@bajaturbo @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 While the church-state distinction shouldn't be interpreted as the secularists insist, there is a biblical distinction in administrative purposes. The Inquisition as an arm of the "church" had no right to administer that sort of justice. Their power extended to excommunication.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I've been asked more questions then I can keep track of by this point. You'll have to be more specific.
@bajaturbo @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You'd have to be more specific. I don't know the whole of Geneva legal code from year x to year y.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 What logical fallacies?
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 But Paul does not say anything about mercy and grace. He speaks of being a terror to the wrongdoers, which Paul most certainly meant in a biblical sense. Now that does not exclude mercy nor does it make mercy the main objective. It takes wisdom to know the difference.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I agree that Paul did not distinguish between saved or lost rulers, because Christ is King of kings and Lord of lords. His Kingdom extends beyond heaven and the hearts of believers.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 God's law
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 That's what I'm saying. If you have some illegitimate court that violates biblical codes of legal conduct, then that is just a refined form of murder.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I believe it was Paul who wrote that their job was to be a terror to the lawless.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 If that's a sin then the person who picked that mode of execution is responsible. Civic leaders are not in the primary business of dispensing mercy and grace. They dispense law and justice.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You're frustrated because logic insists that there is a real distinction between a civic court dispensing judgement based on the rule of law and some guy shooting a store clerk.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 So when a murderer gets lawfully convicted of being a murderer and is executed is the guy who administers the lethal injection a hit man?
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Wallaaah there's a fact behind your ear!
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Here's the thing: we know the Jewish mob did not have the right to carry out the death penalty. It had to go to Romans. Where was the Roman judge?
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Was it a legal proceeding? Did the executioners have a fair trial? Did they present witnesses? Did they even have the right to carry out the execution according to the law?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You see the difference don't you?
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Who put the anti-blasphemy laws on the books? The church or the state? Who carried out the court proceedings? The church or the state? Who determined guilt? Church or State? Who picked the method of execution? Church or state?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 If I am the star witness in a murder trial and my testimony sentences a man to death am I a murderer?
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Arminius was a Calvinist until he wasn't.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Is "responsible for many deaths" the same as murder?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Would a witness for the prosecution in a capital crime case be guilty of murder?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Now this is your evidence of him being a murderer?
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You don't need to be Arminian to be an open theist.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 If they saw that as some legalistic commandment, then Jesus corrected them.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I know there's a lot of disinformation out there from dishonest people, who are terrified of their congregants embracing these ideas, so they spread lies.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 We've been over this before. Geneva was not a theocratic regime ruled by the clergy. John Calvin did not murder anyone. The state executed the law of the land.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Bingo? Who asked the question?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 If the question is whether scripture teaches open theism or predestination, the answer is predestination.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I'm not too familiar with the Lutheran position(s). It is my understanding that although Luther made predestination a point of contention with the Papists, his later followers widely downplayed this aspect of Luther's theology.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 They sold everything in the city (which Jesus said would be destroyed in that generation) and moved outside the city and pooled their money among themselves. They did not give it to random poor people.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Now don't get me wrong. I like think it a good thing that people are embracing the five points, but the five points emerge out of a deeper theology. The five points are not the theology itself.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 There are Calvinistic Methodists, Calvinistic charismatics, Calvinistic IFBs, Calvinistic Southern Baptists, Calvinistic dispensationalists, etc., etc.. Embracing the five points is not enough to be in the Reformed camp.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 First off, let me clear something up. The five points are not Calvinism. They are the five points of anti-Arminianism. Secondly, being Calvinistic is not being Reformed. The five points only make up a sliver of Reformed theology.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 A large crowd on a mount
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It's basic reading comprehension, not dispensationalism. If giving up all possessions was a universal commandment applied to everyone and not simply his entourage of disciples during his earthly ministry, then Jesus would have said it to every person he met.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 MacArthur is a dispensationalist. He's not reformed
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 For the same reason I don't try to walk on water because Jesus told Peter to walk on water.

@PaulsWalls2 @AddieMiller0330 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 He told Servetus not to come to Geneva or face prosecution. Servetus thought he was untouchable. Servetus thought wrong.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 If I was alive during Jesus' earthly ministry and in order to follow him around and be his disciple, then I would certainly give up all my stuff to the poor.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction

    even the wicked for the day of trouble.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Is Twitter your church?
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It's not about turning away. It's about not honoring God as God or giving thanks to Him. This is a major problem in dispensationalist circles.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It doesn't appeal to some people's hearts, because in their hearts they are in love with their own will and they want their will to be done on earth and in heaven. Dispensationalism is an embodiment of this type of heart.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Christ: "And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward."
@SolaScriptura99 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Your goal was destroy total depravity by parroting back a key tenet of Reformed covenantal theology: the OT Saints were save by grace through faith?
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Scripture is inerrant. Calvin is not. I shouldn't have to say that self evident statement, but apparently people have an ax to grind so they want to slander.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 So you just went out into the public sphere and made your prayer for everyone to look at you and a few moments later you write this slander. You just can't help yourself.
@ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 He ends the section by saying:

Woe to you, O Jerusalem!
    How long will it be before you are made clean?”

First off, WOE is a bad thing to hear from prophet. It means you're going to get it. Secondly, it doesn't say "clean yourself up"
@ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Jeremiah is not trying to reassure them of their free will ability to get back on track. He's saying they are thoroughly wicked and that's why God is about to bring massive judgement on them. Destroy their city. Destroy their temple. Put them into slavery to their enemies.
@PaulsWalls2 @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 God says He micromanages things that people call luck or random or chance. You wanna laugh and laugh and post your images as if it is funny. You might think you're mocking me. I am quoting from scripture
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I wasn't speaking to you.
@ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 He says this within the context of the inevitable judgement on a rotten generation.
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 That's what I had in mind. I have no clue what it is. Nobody does. God's intention was only that we know His Decree exists. In the Reformed tradition we speak of the secret Decree as something that must be acknowledged but treated very carefully.
@PaulsWalls2 @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD NOT TO TALK BACK TO GOD. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. YET YOU KEEP ASKING "WHY CAN HE FIND FAULT IF HE'S SOVEREIGN"? PAUL GAVE YOU THE ANSWER. LISTEN TO HIM. THIS IS NOT FUNNY. IT'S NOT SOMETHING TO MOCK. YOU NEED TO REPENT OF THIS NONSENSE
@PaulsWalls2 @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE WORD OF GOD WHICH SAYS GOD IS "HUNG UP ON SOVEREIGN GRACE" AND YOU MOCK HIM. DO YOU THINK THAT IS WISE? IS IT FUNNY? DO YOU THINK YOU'LL GET THE LAST LAUGH?
@ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Jeremiah is mocking them!
@ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 What? What? A leopard can change his spots? Is that what you think Jeremiah is saying?
@higham_mark @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 The problem is God said that the secret decrees belong to Him and we should concern ourselves only with following His commandments, not trying to contrast the commands with the secret decrees. It is a recipe for disaster.
@JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil.
@higham_mark @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 This is how God talks about Himself. Everyone let this sink in. God talks of Himself as micromanaging the casting of lots. Do not mock His Sovereignty or His Decrees. To mock His Decrees is to mock Him. I am here to warn you that this is not good for you. He will harden you.

@presbycast @bkben3 I bet, especially among people knee deep in blasphemy, but there might be a psychological aspect that mitigates against it. I know of ministers who are nuts on Twitter, but their garbed sermons are 100% blandness.
@bkben3 @presbycast Thank you for the insight. I am under the impression that "academic" and "religious" were more or less synonymous back then, but I am not coming from a place of expertise.
@bkben3 @presbycast I'd really be interested to see any evidence of a minister (regardless of denomination or theology) really cutting up or trying way too hard to be relatable/"cool" or making silly pop culture references while wearing special religious garbs during a service.
@bkben3 @presbycast I suspect putting on the garments of an office holder has gravity. I doubt a King putting on his crown feels like he's just putting on his "normal work clothes." I've heard from police officers that putting on their uniform has symbolic weight.
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PresbyPolemics It's the biblical explanation of why the unsaved are "convicted" in a futile sense of their sin without any supernatural imposition of the Third Person of the Trinity

@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @PresbyPolemics The work of the law is written on the hearts of humanity as a whole. Even the sociopath knows what he's doing is wrong. In fact, the knowledge of the sinfulness of his deeds is the source of his pleasure.

@JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @rlongman1 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies You have a very impersonal God to make room for your autonomous fiction
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @rlongman1 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Nice story. Was your existence decreed? You already admitted that you dismiss the notion that your conversion was a part of God's decree/plan/purpose. Your conversion was a purposeless accident. A fluke. But what about your birth?
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @rlongman1 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Was your existence decreed? Does God even care about you coming into existence?
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @rlongman1 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies You exist. Did God decree your existence?
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @rlongman1 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Did God decree your existence? Did God decree your conversion?
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @rlongman1 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Were you predestined to be "born again"?

@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @rlongman1 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies That would explain a lot of why the words aren't getting through to you.
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @rlongman1 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies So you deem yourself as unelect?
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @rlongman1 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Do you know the point of esoteric knowledge is not share it with people freely, especially those who disagree with you?
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I've answered this numerous times in numerous ways. I've even shared my testimony and had it questioned and mocked. If you are serious, go back and look for it.
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I'll ask again politely: please recognize the creature-creator distinction.
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Our God is a dictator. Nobody elected Him. Nobody can vote Him out of office. He has no balance of power with anyone. One of the names of the God we worship is Despotēs. You better recognize where you are in the order of things.
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Deny yourself
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Is up more down than down? I'm sick of this 1984 speak about weakness being strength. It's absurd. You are jealous of your perceived free will when there's only one will you should be concerned about.
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I have complete faith that God is faithful to His promises
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I have His word and I'm preaching it to you. I'm not telling you anything different than what Paul said to the Romans circa 2000 years ago. Stop talking back to God about how He dispenses mercy.
@higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies "Limited sovereignty" is a very accurate description of their doctrine
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies The TRUTH is God shows mercy on who He wills. He hardens who He wills. I am here to warn you that all this talking back to God is dangerous. You are not immune to being hardened yourself.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Do you know what faith means?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies There's that liberal humanist great defense of the reprobate against the authority of God. Scratch the surface just a little and it's always there. You've got baggage to drop.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Are you asking where I got the idea that there are negative sanctions for rejecting the Gospel as foolishness or repulsive, etc., etc.?
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies It's God's will. The Gospel is a sign of blessing for some and negative sanction for others. God intends to judge the world.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies MacArthur isn't reformed. He's a Calvinistic dispensationalist, which is an entirely convoluted and confused theology.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Yeah, that's the worldwide Great Commission
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies That's not what the text says. That's you position, which seems more accurately to be that Jesus died because that's how things happened to work out, and the good news is people are able to preach the gospel of free will about Jesus being able to save people who enjoy preaching
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Yes, but do you see the difference between (1) the spirit pouring out to the further reaches of the world and (2) every single individual getting saved?
RT @ThePrisoner006: Because liberal theology is merely a reflection of modern psychology, it is not really Christianity at all.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies John is speaking about the outpouring of the spirit on to the whole map spreading worship of Yahweh to the furthest reaches
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Propitiation is the act of appeasing God thru Christ. That doesn't apply to the "whole world" if you define it as every individual, because people who are propitiated for don't go to hell. Yet, people do go to hell. Therefore, whole world doesn't mean every single person
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I have faith. I have had prayers answered. I ascribe that to God in praise and glory.
@higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Yes please!
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I said the world is bigger than a little plot of land the size of NJ. It is not every single person and plant and animal and germ and virus etc
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies That's not what I said. For someone who obsessively makes distinctions between Jews and gentiles you're missing a big one here.
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies If you're right then propitiation doesn't mean propitiation, and if propitiation doesn't mean propitiation then your sins being absolved doesn't mean your sins are absolved. OR "whole world" refers to the whole map, (i.e., larger than Israel) not every individual.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Classic = orthodox
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies You act like that's not part of the decree. You act like the lack of real autonomous free will negates the existence of a nature. Let go of the baggage and see God everywhere.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies All Glory all the time. He has a plan. I'm grateful to be able to have the ear of the King of the universe.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I can pray whenever. Having some discipline in this area is a great blessing, but there's no need to be OCD or legalist about it.
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies You can't imagine because you don't understand and you respond with hostility to those who are trying to help you understand.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I'll take any real questions if you've got them
@higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Exactly! Why pray if God isn't in control? Why pray for the conversion of others if God can't overcome their autonomous free will?
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies A person's prayer is part of the decree so that when God fulfills a prayer He receives the Glory and His name is praised and His power demonstrated as a witness and comfort.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies We are told to pray. We are given the desire to pray. We are told to make requests from a position of humility.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Intense communion
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies It's a common feature in prayer life.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies You should start walking that talk and ditch the worldly baggage you're dragging along with you.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies That's the mindset of the poor reprobate that you keep shedding tears over. Pick a side.
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies God has a purpose for everything. We do not need to understand what the purpose is, but we do not ever question how He decides to run the universe to work out His will. Such questioning is a lack of real faith. You seem to have an issue in that arena.
@First_Cabbage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @BWSchank @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies @PresbyPolemics If find the challenge helpful for myself and for people who are on the fence about to go down the wrong path.

@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies See there you go again being the Braveheart to the wicked. This is why I find your whole system completely liberal and humanist. They thought they could just go raping their way through Asia and God would sit back and do nothing?
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Our society is being judged for hating God. Meanwhile, many Christians think playing Braveheart for the reprobates is like the most loving thing ever. Others reject their responsibilities to be light via escapism into unbiblical rapture mania.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I'm a compatablist with regards to Satan. Scripture is crystal clear about it.

@jasonschomburg @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Apologies. I meant to imply "you" in a generic sense, not you specifically. I wasn't trying to preach at you lol
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I have a problem with it. It's a divine judgement on our society as a whole. We are being called to step up and drop this escapism that dispensationalism typifies.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies If it happened, t was part of God's plan. This is why being resentful and unforgiving and jealous and envious are such a destructive sins. It's basically saying: "I don't like you God for how you are running the universe. I could do better."
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @jasonschomburg @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies You think your worthless rags that you take credit for are going to impress God?
@jasonschomburg @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Put another way, if you receive the seal of the spirit and numerous spiritual blessings start to flow from that and as you become a better person, don't start taking credit for it. Give the glory to God for transforming you form the wretch you once were.
@jasonschomburg @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Yes. It's part of sanctification. The spirit molds you throughout your life to be in conformance with the image of Christ. You will never get there totally in this life, but it is a taste of things to come: the complete transformation of your nature as an adopted son of God.
@jasonschomburg @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Yes, you do it, but at the same time you are not alone. The HS is not some external force. You are united.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I am not saying the aborted babies are atoning for the sins of the elect.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies The atomic bomb was not up for public discussion. It was top secret. Your whole scenario is make believe.
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @jasonschomburg @JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I am not a mid acts dispy who gets triggered like a demon anytime someone quotes Jesus. By the Grace of God, I do forgive people, and He makes it easy. Without eating I will die. That's what happens. Thank God for your meals.
@JeffPassage @jasonschomburg @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies So you take credit for something the divine power does? You don't see a problem with that?
@ThaRealJgibbs @jasonschomburg @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies The Lord's Prayer and 1 Cor 10:13 are not in opposition.

@jasonschomburg @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies You aren't able to resist the devil on your own. That's why we ask God in prayer to "lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one."
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Who has ever said this? You're playing make believe
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies That's completely unsubstantiated
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies This fits under the umbrella of He hardens who He wills.
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Jesus loses none of the elect. That is true, but you don't really believe in God's election so appealing to 1 John 5:12 makes no sense.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies He ordained the murder of His own son yet condemned it at the same time.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies God is sovereign over all affairs, including matters of the state. The NT makes this crystal clear.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies God has given us a peek behind the curtain about this: He shows mercy on who He wills and He hardens who He wills.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Well since your camp has an escapist view I don't have to worry about you guys getting power and being able to legally do something about what I say.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I deny nothing. I love the whole council of God. Dispys can't say the same.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Not personal vengeance. Civic leaders have a responsibility and authority that non office holders do not have. If they hate blasphemy against God as poison for society, they can do something about it legally
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies What does the law say about blasphemers? Now you can say the law doesn't apply today, but that still doesn't change the content of God's character. He loathes them as poisonous.
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies If you really think about it, this free will obsession won't even guarantee your place in heaven if you happen to get there. You can still use your free will to rebel and get sent to hell for the rest of eternity.
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies OSAS is incompatible with a high view of free will. If you can become saved by your own decree then you can become unsaved by your own decree. Nobody is stopping you from unsaving yourself. The Arminians are at least consistent on this point.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies God isn't big on blasphemy. He is quite clear that neither shall we.
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies He's mad about the Reformers punishing blasphemers who refused to stop publically blaspheming.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Not a member of that club, but apparently you haven't dropped the whole Spartacus for the reprobate gimmick. I wonder what God thinks about that.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I get it. I get it. You're super pro-blasphemy.
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I'm giving you a challenge. You can test your OSAS idea while you're at it. (BTW I don't know how you manage to reconcile those two views, but okay)
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Prove it. If your pride means that much to you, then renounce Christ and become a Satanist just so you can brag that you have the free will to do it. Meanwhile, everyone else will say they went out from us because they were never of us.

They took credit for what they did rather then give credit to God. Jesus called them hypocrites

Nevertheless, there has always been a godly remnant, and just as not all Israel is Israel, not all the church is the church.

@PresbyPolemics I've heard many say something like this: 

"I was all about God in youth group, but then I went to college and my politics changed and I didn't like the politics of the people in my local church so I rejected God."

I'm sorry, but that's how people talk about a social club.

@ThaRealJgibbs @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @Pjg19792017 @mikem2u @j_kordusky @lampandlightmin @NahumOBrien @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage If you feel the history of the ideas I just laid out is not true, but you just left it like that, I have to assume that you just mean that you don't like what historians of ideas have had to say.

Freewillism entails autonomy, not being contingent or limited by anything. The best example of it is the transsexual movement, in which people define themselves against their own nature.

@ThomasCoutouzis I've been fascinated by this letter. The other day I had an odd thought: is it in the realm of possibility that Jude's remark about wanting to write a more comprehensive letter (verse 3) refers to a work he would later complete; i.e., the Epistle to the Hebrews?

@mikem2u @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @j_kordusky @lampandlightmin @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Some are literal + symbolic.

@mikem2u @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @j_kordusky @lampandlightmin @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage The literal, existential status of the pot that Jeremiah saw in any dimension is an interesting question but completely beyond the point of the text. What does the showing of the pot mean?
@mikem2u @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @j_kordusky @lampandlightmin @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Was he looking into another universe where the pot literally was but in a way completely foreign to us, but visible to other persons who were in that other universe? Or was the pot something God put in his head. We don't know.
@mikem2u @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @j_kordusky @lampandlightmin @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Yes. They have real meaning with power. Think of Jeremiah when he became a prophet. He heard a voice that was not "literally" there. Then he was told to announce what he saw. An almond branch. A pot. They were not "literal", physical things. We don't know what they were.
@jabuc @XyZyddious @JenHatmaker I'm actually pretty ecumenical in my understanding of who I consider a "real Christians." There are a lot of sects and denominations in Christianity. I disagree with some, but they're still Christians. The liberal attempt at Christianity is another religion though.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @mikem2u @JeffPassage @j_kordusky @lampandlightmin @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage So when you read the story of Sarah and Hagar, you don't see any level of allegory?
@jabuc @XyZyddious @JenHatmaker How post mod!
@XyZyddious @jabuc @JenHatmaker It's more like finding out what the "cool" heathens are talking about in regards to crushing Christianity. Read that memo. Come up with some weird interpretation to justify agreeing with them. Attack the real Christians as twisted Christians for not trying to impress heathens.
@jabuc @XyZyddious @JenHatmaker And the name of your NYT religion is what?
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @mikem2u @JeffPassage @j_kordusky @lampandlightmin @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Scripture assumes that readers understand genre without having to spell itself out. A simple example would be the anthropomorphic passages about the Father, e.g., He has wings. This is clearly not literal. Does scripture tell us it's not literal? No.
@jabuc @XyZyddious @JenHatmaker The foundation is sola scriptura with the aid of the Confessions &amp; Catechisms. It's not what the NYT editorial staff considers anathema or righteous. They are on some other religious kick.
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @mikem2u @JeffPassage @j_kordusky @lampandlightmin @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage I've asked it before and I'll ask it again: how do you take a vision or a prophetic oracle literally?
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @mikem2u @BWSchank @JeffPassage @j_kordusky @lampandlightmin @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage After explaining the destruction of Temple I and the cause of the Babylonian exile, God told Ezekiel that there would be restitution. In the 25th year of the exile, God sent Ezekiel a vision of Temple II (Ez 40-48). The construction of Temple II began c. 45 years later.
@nocoradio You'd make a good editor if you're not one already. The condition of "only" was pretty heavy-handed on my part. I am not sure if even the most antinomian dispensationalist hyper grace teacher could be accused of only talking about forensic justification.
@ExilePolitics @AngelaBocage @traveller_terry But still... that fits comfortably under the umbrella of the self-congratulatory, fashionable, (post) modernist ethos, but I get your quibble.

@ExilePolitics @AngelaBocage @traveller_terry Witty, but like or not, they are asking the question and generally going to special revelation in a serious and sincere fashion. It's not some self-referential projection https://t.co/GXHw5IPl7w
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @mikem2u @JeffPassage @j_kordusky @lampandlightmin @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage The literalism that you're talking about would be foreign to the early Church. The dispy version of literalism has an element that borders on Asperger’s syndrome. I sincerely wish I had the vocabulary to find a more polite way to say that, but words fail. I'm open to suggestions.
@AngelaBocage @traveller_terry @ExilePolitics In a sense I agree with you. The liberal expression of Christianity is an entirely different religion with an entirely different concept of God. It's just not the God of special revelation.

@nocoradio I get where he went off the rail, but honestly who is allowed to say something like "maybe we've become imbalanced in talking only about forensic justification to the neglect of the whole package which includes sanctification" and not be called a neolegalist with another gospel?

@RegReformedGuys @BarleyAndBeans Fortunately, Rome is completely incompetent and is moving towards more and more worldly, "relevant" modernism post-VatII. Oh and they keep molesting boys.
@RegReformedGuys @BarleyAndBeans The same lack of seriousness in sermons that contributed to the YRR phenomenon a while back could have a liturgical counterpart: people going to Rome for the smells and bells led by men not trying to look down-to-earth in a leather jacket.
@RegReformedGuys @BarleyAndBeans It's something we need to keep in mind. I keep an eye on the Roman apologists and the most effective go after our weak spots; e.g., there's a lot of vapidness and frankly silliness going on in Prot churches: a 20 min adult contemporary rock show followed by a stand up routine.
@RegReformedGuys @BarleyAndBeans LOL same here
@RegReformedGuys @BarleyAndBeans Ice cold! https://t.co/334y96ilt6
@BarleyAndBeans @RegReformedGuys Don't get me wrong: Rome sucks. They had their lamp stand taken a long time ago, but their problems stem from serious theological errors too many to list here.
@BarleyAndBeans @RegReformedGuys LOL or maybe I'm just projecting. I recall the first time I experienced a real, self-consciously liturgical liturgy there was a split second of inarticulate discomfort as if something Roman was about to go down, but a second later I realized liturgy is beautiful thing.
@BarleyAndBeans @RegReformedGuys Although Baptists suffer the hardest with Romaphobia by far, it is a widespread Prot condition stemming from our history as defining ourselves not by who we are, but too much by our nay-saying and battle scars to the point where accusations of Roman-ness are seen as a check mate.

@First_Cabbage John seemed to view instruments as similar to divorce, an accommodation https://t.co/FBc07R0cfz
@First_Cabbage Still taking it in. Clement of Alexandria (see ch 4) https://t.co/LeycqYETGr
John Chrysostom said something similar
@PauleyMo67 None of the non-Lutheran reformers endorsed instruments apparently
@First_Cabbage It isn't like blood signs (circumcision and animal sacrifice) fulfilled in the cross or the temple which Jesus cursed as destined to destruction. I don't get the argument yet
@First_Cabbage The better argument seems to be based on church history: church fathers and lack of instruments until over a thousand years of church history (according to the sources I have been looking at)
@PauleyMo67 I admit that I don't fully get it or if I am getting the best of the best argument for the position. Part of me wonders if it is actually an attempt to rationalize the historically understandable but still irrational phenomenon of Romaphobia
Learning about the position that musical instruments in worship were shadows that passed away in the New Covenant. Trying to be open minded but my gut says "dunno about that"
@gosuperaa @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 @First_Cabbage Something new to learn today: reformed/covenant theology is not a denomination
@gosuperaa @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 @First_Cabbage Reformed is in relation to Rome. The real theology is called covenant theology
@gosuperaa @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 @First_Cabbage One word in one translation. But the -ist and - ism isn't there in any translation
@gosuperaa @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 @First_Cabbage Then take dispensationalist out of your vocabulary
@gosuperaa @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 @First_Cabbage I am reformed. You are a dispy. Labels: we all do it!
@gosuperaa @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 @First_Cabbage Reformed people are trinitarians. It would be blasphemous to call the third person of the trinity a bot. Nobody would say that. Now if you don't want to know about it I suggest simply not talking about it
@gosuperaa @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 @First_Cabbage Am I talking to a random bible verse generating bot? I don't feel like this is a real conversation :\
@gosuperaa @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 @First_Cabbage So you can make ignorant accusations about other people's positions and when you are called out, then you can claim a made up biblical imperative to be ignorant? What about the imperative to not talk foolishly or slander?
@gosuperaa @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 @First_Cabbage Do you really think that reformed people deny that Jesus was predestined?
@gosuperaa @First_Cabbage @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 It is more of a problem for dispys who lack a fully formed conception of sanctification especially the progressive aspect of it.
@gosuperaa @First_Cabbage @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 It is not a problem for the non strawman reformed position
@gosuperaa @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 @First_Cabbage Jesus came into the world for the world. This is amazing for some and heaped coals for others. Preaching the gospel to to the unelect is a form of judgement
@gosuperaa @First_Cabbage @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 You do what you are. The elect will sin because they are not fully sanctified in this life

@West221B @PauleyMo67 With regards to Christian music, I think it has more to do with Christianity being seen as a viable market if approached in a formulaic, lowest common denominator, flattened out subculture.
@PauleyMo67 Nice!
@PauleyMo67 Do you have a link to any of your recordings?
@PauleyMo67 World Lite is a good way to say it. It seems like Christians (I'm painting with a large brush) are taking the world forms and making them worse aesthetically.
@PauleyMo67 And I don't want to come across like saying "if you're doing music you should do what Handel did." That's looking backwards too much. With today's technology you can make a BIG sound aiming towards TRANSCENDENCE like Handel did with an orchestra but by yourself in your bedroom.
@PauleyMo67 TBH, I am a pretty new Christian (~ 1 year) so I don't know the depth of contemporary Christian culture, but I don't think someone like Handel was treating his music primarily as secular outreach or a religious alternative that tries to emulate the world with Jesus thrown in.
Before Christian culture started making pop songs that basically signified "Jesus Is My Boyfriend, He's Got a Sweet Ride, and He Never Lets Me Down", there was a desire to capture and evoke God's TRANSCENDENCE

Once again: the elect are the believing ones. They were regenerated so they answered the call so they were justified so they were sanctified. On their own autonomous power? No. God ordained it to be.
@GenevanGeneral I am not too familiar with IFB subculture. I was under the impression that they were hyper-literal and hostile to any whiff of symbolism or allegory. I guess there's more diversity than I thought.
@GenevanGeneral Yikes! Wonder how they'd treat the part about Lot and his daughters.
@GenevanGeneral Is it just me or do they take the most obviously symbolic things and turn them literal and the most obviously literal things and turn them symbolic?

Erasmus lacked a finished copy of the Book of Revelation and translated the final six verses (including 22:19) back into Greek from the Latin Vulgate.

Think about it from your perspective. People can lose their salvation according to the KJV. It wasn't like they thought they had it but didn't. They had it written in ink, but they changed a word and lost their salvation.

Rev 3:5: "I will never blot his name out of the book of life"

Common grace is often the other side of the special curse of reprobation. It's postponing the destruction of Noah's generation or the Canaanites or giving Israel 40 years after the crucifixion.

2. I believe in two types of grace: common and special. The elect have special grace, which is salvific. The rain falling on the field of the wicked is an example of (non-salvific) common grace.

If you can't get enough SJW in today's church, check out the USA TV series called "Damnation" for some retro church social justice. It's about a socialist pretending to be a preacher in rural America in the 1930s.

Let me translate for you: don't follow the heretics, follow me. 

What it does NOT say: don't follow Jesus, Peter, John, James, or Jude, follow me because this is the cult of Paul, nobody gets to the Father except through me.

I am just trying to avoid mixing up concepts. I would probably talk about "love" rather than "grace" in the Edenic world.

I don't think that's even how dispensationalists talk about grace. Grace is mercy. Mercy is needed because of sin.

Having good food to eat in Eden was not a form of grace. I don't think that even the reformed thinkers who write about Common Grace (i.e., non-Salvific Grace) would call the good fruit in Eden a form of grace.

2. The Edenic world was a world without grace. Grace only comes into the picture as a consequence of sin.

@childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Generally speaking, I suppose that's right, but there is an element in RT of God invisibly prearranging the whole thing even though we might have the impression that we are the ones taking the lead.
@childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Reformed theology makes a distinction between the general calling and the special calling. The general calling is hearing some street preacher, but having the message roll off you. The special calling is the effectual call where everything comes together and you respond.
@childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien In reformed thought, the church is visible and invisible. Generally speaking, we are confined to dealing with the visible church, which contains a mix of elect and unelect people, and we don't know who is who. The falling away passages are directed to the visible church.
@childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien That is a real problem for those who are mere 5 pointers (as distinguished from reformed). Contrary to popular opinion, the real point of reformed thought isn't free will or predestination. It's covenant, which fully explains the falling away passages.

@BWSchank @PauleyMo67 @PaulsWalls2 @childofpromise3 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien And that mystery is computer chips with the number 666? Give me a break. You've taken that verse and run way to far with it.

@BWSchank @PauleyMo67 @PaulsWalls2 @childofpromise3 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien LOL the funny thing is none of that is in scripture. You guys didn't discover something real that everyone else in the world missed. You are just wildly imaginative readers imposing your fantasy on the text.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @PauleyMo67 @childofpromise3 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Solid eschatology there, but before any of that can happen we have to discover a land composed entire of milk and honey in order for that prophecy to be fulfilled, and since we haven't found it on earth, we have to look to other solar systems to find it.

MIND EXPLOSION
@BWSchank @PauleyMo67 @PaulsWalls2 @childofpromise3 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien HOLD UP! Quick question: does the phrase "the Church of the Jews in Sinai with Moses" cause a dispy brain bleed?
@PaulsWalls2 @PauleyMo67 @BWSchank @childofpromise3 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Lemme give it a dispy try: Jesus and Paul had different messages and if Paul said the same thing as Jesus, then it must be for the Jews, maybe just the trib era Jews, because gentiles can do whatever they want so the verse couldn't be for them. Do I have dispy method down yet?
@PauleyMo67 @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @childofpromise3 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien There must have been some Jews in Ephesus. Maybe we have to "rightly divide" that verse for them. Am I getting this whole dispy thing yet?

@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @PauleyMo67 @childofpromise3 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien I have not done either. They are both great ministries.

What are they going to do? Preach the 10Cs at them? They've already rejected them! They've got nothing outside of Caesar, who becomes their ultimate standard because they reject God's standards.
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @PauleyMo67 @childofpromise3 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien And what was that about? The liberty to steal cars? The liberty to cheat on your spouse? The liberty to curse God? 

You are abusing that verse.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @PauleyMo67 @childofpromise3 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Those are your Guru's ideas. Ask him.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @PauleyMo67 @childofpromise3 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien And when you are not the same. You won't lash out at the ideas I listed above. You won't call baptism a burden. You won't reject repentance. You won't reject good works too burdensome. This is how an unbeliever untouched by the Triune God thinks.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @PauleyMo67 @childofpromise3 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien We do not worship works. We do not say that works save you. However, our conception of Christianity is deeply Trinitarian. That means that it isn't some philosophy you embrace and get a ticket punched. It leads to radical transformation from the inside out. You won't be the same.
@BWSchank @PauleyMo67 @childofpromise3 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Of course not. 

When you read the scriptures in the spirit it leads you to reject the teachings of Jesus, the covenant, the kingdom, baptism, the Lord's Supper, good works, charity, God's standards of justice, 10 commandments, going to church, etc.,. Wonder what spirit that is?
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @childofpromise3 @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Of course your system depends on keeping those two groups separate ALWAYS. I get it. I get it. I get it. It's what you say in every single tweet.

@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @childofpromise3 @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Putting them in the ghetto = "rightly dividing" according to MADs

@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @childofpromise3 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien I've already proved that the unbelievers divide the word almost exactly like you MADs do. Congrats! Give yourself a round of applause! That's quite a feet!
@BWSchank @childofpromise3 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Paul has a deeply, deeply, deeply Trinitarian conception of this. The law is written on our hearts so in that regard we are not "under" the law. We walk it in the spirit. We don't trample it. We live it in love. We sing Psalm 1 of our love for it.
@BWSchank @childofpromise3 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien I'm not playing around. You're lying to yourself if you don't realize this whole "rightly dividing" catchphrase means nothing other than consistently sniffing out the Jewish stuff and saying it doesn't apply to you.
@BWSchank @childofpromise3 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien No you haven't. All you've proven is your bias towards all things gentile and a knee jerk reaction to dissociate yourself from Jesus, Peter, James, Jude, John, and all Hebrews.
@BWSchank @childofpromise3 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien I understand. Peter was not an honorary gentile. Paul was an honorary gentile. You only care about stuff written to gentiles. Everything else is not for you. Peter says the same as Paul you poo poo it. Paul says the same as Peter and you talk of "crisscross", not another gospel
@childofpromise3 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien They will disagree with my phrasing, but I'm tired of pussyfooting around what is going on here. When they say "rightly dividing," they mean separating the Jews from the gentiles regardless of whether they are professing Christians. Look everything they say and how they say it.
@childofpromise3 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Let me help: MADs essentially believe that the key to "rightly dividing" is found in the realization that Paul is an honorary gentile. Peter never became an honorary gentile so they nitpick and dismiss everything he says as insufficient and inferior compared to Paul.

Ernest Renan (1823-1892) did the same with Jesus. He claimed Jesus purged himself of all Jewish traits and become an gentile ("Aryan"). Dispys say Renan got the wrong guy.

@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @childofpromise3 @BWSchank @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @ThaRealJgibbs @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Dispys are confused about these things. They can't decide if Kingdom of God and Kingdom of Heaven point to the same idea. They can't decide if the promises of that Kingdom were transferred in Matt 21 and what that means for the church and Israel. It's a mess of thoughts
@PaulsWalls2 @mikem2u @BWSchank @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage I have listened but I'm saying that it doesn't make sense. The most I can determine is that Paul can say good works are the result of the spirit but that's just because dispys have made him an honorary gentile or "one  of the good ones" and dispys reject all other Jewish writers.
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @childofpromise3 @BWSchank @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @ThaRealJgibbs @mikem2u @NahumOBrien You dispys need to make up your mind whether the Kingdom of God is physical or spiritual.

@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @ThaRealJgibbs @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Because if we talk about how faith shouldn't be a coping mechanism to not feel guilt about living like a heathen then we would start sounding like Jesus' brother James, and that's not for the church, or so I'm told.
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @ThaRealJgibbs @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Maybe all that stuff in Paul about doing good and not sinning wasn't for the church? Maybe there are different dispensations within Paul's letters that we need to "rightly divide", i.e., not think about. Maybe all we should focus on is the parts we like?
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @ThaRealJgibbs @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Hold up.

The dispy version of Paul doesn't talk about fruit. Fruit is works and law, which doesn't mix with grace, or so I'm told.

@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @ThaRealJgibbs @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage I saw that, but what's this do good work stuff?

How would you even know what the unbelievers are saying? What I said was factual. One of the goals of unbelieving scholars is to point out the "tension" between the texts to show disharmony among NT writers.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @PaulsWalls2 @jasonhatch20 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage "according to (1) my gospel &amp; (2) THE PREACHING OF JESUS CHRIST"

According Mid Acts Dispys (as well as all the anti-Christrian scholars), Paul and Jesus are in opposition to each other and cannot be harmonized. 

Normal Christians say they do harmonize. That's the issue.

Allegory is not always wrong. Paul used it. I tend to avoid it. I do not interpret Revelation as allegory. It is a different type of literature that requires a different approach than say the book of Ruth.

@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Agreed, but the head of the household can be held accountable for being a delinquent spiritual head.
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Baptism isn't salvation.
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage If you're not talking about Baptism or the Lord's Supper what are you calling the "sacramental system"?
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Yep, circumcision doesn't save either.
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Unfortunately I am not in a good place to get my massive edition of Institutes and give it a good looking over, but if I wanted to understand what Calvin thought about Baptism I would go to his section about Baptism, not the Lord's Supper.
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Yes. Disciples were not just kicking in households and baptizing everyone. The head of the house converts and says my whole house is going to be Christian now. Let's get baptized.
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Maybe you're right and God performed a miracle by making sure that there were no babies in any of the innumerable households where everyone in the household was baptized on a single day ;)
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage What I just posted was from the Institutes. Infant Baptism is as old as Christianity itself so it has that going for it. Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper so your attempt to make it Roman is absurd.
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage You have some bad info. Calvin did not believe in baptismal regeneration. He was quite clear about it: "that assurance of salvation does not depend on participation in the sacraments, as if justification existed in it."
@teach_tao @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage He went to his death screaming that Jesus was not Lord and Savior and anyone who thought that was idiotic.

@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank I don't Skype. I don't even possess the tech to do it. I appreciate the offer though.
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Or course he thought it was coming soon. He was in that generation, but it wasn't people getting beamed out into outer space and the sun dying and the stars from outside our solar system crashing into earth. It was the end of the order as they knew it.
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage They sold everything in the city because the Messiah cut a New Covenant with many, got cut off, and God was going to destroy everything there. They weren't wishing upon a star. That's what happened.
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage You don't think Peter ever read Daniel since Pentecost? The Messiah cuts a New Covenant with many. The rest get the Messiah cut off. Israel gets destroyed. Peter was there when Christ called the Kingdom a mustard seed, not a special effect event.
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Why are you acting like this was some big question mark, as if events could have gone any other way? Every informed believer knew the city and temple was going to be destroyed. It was just a question of when in that generation it would occur.
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Make up your mind: either they are a different species or they are not. I've made my position clear, but you're all over the place.
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage I agree that they aren't a different species, but I'd like you to start reading the New Testament like you actually believe that. This whole mentality of Peter wrote to Jews so I can dismiss it because they are a different species than me is a broken, disturbing approach.
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage And if Peter was teaching a message at odds with Paul's then Peter would not have mentioned Paul being another resource for what Peter was explaining. They are on the same page, but your system has blinded you.
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Peter did not write a systematic theology. All the pieces are there but your system has blinded you to them because you want to treat Jews as some other species. It's weird at best.
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage How does this happen? Peter: "knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot."
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Peter: "why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.”
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Peter stood up and said to them, "...we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus"
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Peter: "obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.

@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage So you do not plan to inform them about your theory that they are basically Judaizers?
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage No duh. Baptism is a sign of the New Covenant.

@BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Abraham had a revelation of future fulfillment. Paul had a revelation of fulfillment. We aren't talking about apples and oranges.
@BWSchank @mikem2u @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage So you reject the resurrection?

@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @teach_tao @JeffPassage @mikem2u @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Absolutely not. Could a perfected being do anything other than be perfect?

Jesus gave the prophecy circa 30 A.D..
He said it would happen in a generation, which scripture sees as 40 years. 

30 + 40 = 70. 

The temple was destroyed in 70 A.D.
Jesus wasn't a false prophet.

On his way to be crucified Jesus told the crowd not to weep for him. They should weep for themselves and their children. 

Later the crowd shouted let his blood be on us and our children. 

Their generation.
@BWSchank @mikem2u @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I treat parables as parables. For instance, I do not believe that the sheep and goat parable is about the biological creatures known specifically as ovis aries and capra aegagrus hircus.
@BWSchank @mikem2u @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I don't think we are talking about anything so physical. God dwells in heaven. The earth is a footstool. The spirit goes to God when the body goes in the ground. There are many figures of speech to describe this because hyper literal won't cut it
@BWSchank @mikem2u @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage You think paradise is different from heaven? Did you ever consider that scripture is not an owner's manual for a printer? It is more like poetry intended to be evocative
@BWSchank @mikem2u @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Eccles 12:7 the dust returns to the earth the spirit returns to God
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational Obviously I agree with Paul. The signs of the old covenant have been replaced by new symbols and/or fulfilled in Christ
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational Maybe he wants them not to convert so they can build the third temple and resume animal sacrifices
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational I agree that you can teach children and new converts the practical application of being a Christian without pounding the law, but you can't do it without the law. There is no other standard.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational https://t.co/JCulzaYdT6
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational When Paul addresses practical theology he turns to the law every single time. Why? Because he saw continuity. God's standards didn't change. Dishonoring your parents is unlawful under any administration.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational The liberty of dishonoring one's parents? Paul didn't want that. What on earth are you talking about?
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational In Ephesians, Paul tells children to honor their mother and father. Where did he get that idea from? Oh wait, I know! The LAW! Paul expects Christians to walk in the spirit and if they wonder if they are doing that or not, they turn to the law for God's standard.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational How would you know? The Bible isn't a newspaper. If you want to see fulfillment you need to read other sources, but you won't do that because you fancy yourself a bible only type of guy.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational LOL where did Paul ground his attack on that litany of sins? His own personal preferences? No! It was in the LAW of God! It was such common sense that it could have gone without saying. Paul was about the signs of the Old Covenant being fulfilled.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational The reason why is because independent fundy antinomianism is 100%  impractical. How are you going to tell your kids not to steal when you've  drummed into them that Jesus abolished the 8th commandment? It's schizo.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational Just as anarchy trends towards tyranny, independent fundy antinomianism trends towards independent fundy legalism. Many of your independent fundamentalist buds have made up their own new set of sins! Drinking, smoking, movies, music, dancing, not tucking in your shirt, etc.!
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational I take Jesus' emphatic insistence of events happening during that generation, literally. I take "shortly" &amp; "quickly" come to pass literally. I do not take a red dragon, with 7 heads &amp; 10 horns literally especially when the writer tells me not to take that section literally.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational I am not calling you a liar. You probably do go out into the world and witness, but I am saying you go out in the world to recruit people to come back with you into your proverbial bunker. It is still escapist and retreat.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational Like I said, the Scofield Bible was treated as just the Bible. Most churches with "Bible" in the name are Scofield churches. Those sermons you heard, where the preacher said "I'm just preaching from the Word of God!" were actually preaching from Scofield's reference notes.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational That's your tradition. Now you guys fight over how much to cut out of the Bible and how to practically live it. You seem like a mid-Acts camp type of guy, but protocol insists that you don't admit stuff like that.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational The Scofield Study Bible with its dispy interpretive grid was embraced and spoken of as synonymous with the Bible so much so that independent fundamentalists aren't sure where one begins and the other ends. It's all the same.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational A huge chunk of Christian academics went liberal and the main people who  stood up to the liberals were Calvinists. Your lot retreated from the field  into your bunkers and became obsessed with a mythical escapist rapture and enforced an anti-intellectual culture.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational It's like you think not having footnotes makes it less man made, but it doesn't. It's just incredibly prideful and deceptive.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational LOL are you kidding me? Do you have any idea how you look to everyone else? You have a tradition of saying you don't have a tradition, but you guys all say the same stuff, do the same stuff, and conform to the same stuff. Look in the mirror.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational Here's your problem and it is a rampant problem among independent fundamentalists: you all say the same things and you pretend that you have no teachers, you have only one book, and you have no traditions. It's dishonest.
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational Who believes this besides you? Are you so ashamed to admit the names of your influences or is it pride that makes you want to take their findings as your own?
@teach_tao @JeffPassage @BWSchank @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Jeff is complaining that it would be wrong for God to not ask his permission to change is nature and draw Jeff to God so that God can save Jeff. It is bizarre.

@JeffPassage @BWSchank @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage You're breaking down the Creator-Creation distinction. 

You are not equal with God. He has the authority to do in righteousness what would be sinful for you to do.

God can send a disease to a society for reason X, Y, or Z. You cannot. God can induce a miscarriage. You cannot.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage LOL you're like an unconscious person rescued at the scene of an accident who later complains about the medics violating your free will. Why is this your knee jerk reaction?
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage @dispensational Are there any books that claim that the book of James is like a message in a bottle that will only be relevant after the rapture? If so, could you list two or three authors?
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Peer review might not get it right but it is a practical application of biblical principles, namely two or three reliable witnesses
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage You want to make big claims without two or three witnesses? Okay I dismiss you as a rando internet guy
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Name 3
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Head of the nation, head of the household. This is how scripture talks of hierarchy and authority.  Christ has it all. The earth is his footstool
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage At this point it looks like you are all alone in the history of Christian thought like a random guy on the internet making big claims with nobody by your side, no body of work, no allies among your peers.
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Could you name three published authors who agree with what you just said or is it all you?
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Wowzer that is far out!
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Wow see that is what I was talking about with the weird ethnic obsession. Just because of language and genealogy you assume they are not Christians. It is weird
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I hope you do not celebrate the Lord's Supper with that attitude
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker God is not done with China. The whole world has been given to the the head of the church: Jesus
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker Israel was once the bride but it was replaced theologically and historically. One was destroyed. The other was given the world. I do not get the dispy obsession with a distinction destroyed
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker https://t.co/0ZGlQKFLzp
@BWSchank @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Yeah it is the LAW written on the heart not the eradication of the law. Why did Paul condemn idol worship? 2nd commandment was for the Jews, right? Wrong. You do not understand Paul
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage There is no salvation outside of covenant. You want one with out the other. It does not work that way.
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Hebrew was written to Christians and you pretend you can ignore it because of their DNA
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage It is all about covenant, not DNA. You can't just dismiss a NT letter based on the DNA of the audience. It is a weird way of reading the text.
@BWSchank @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Lol Paul was not an antinomian like you. For instance, Paul says honor your parents. (5th commandment) Why? The law was supposedly dead. But here is the thing. You do not understand Paul
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage You reject most of the NT for being too Jewy for your liking.
@BWSchank @teach_tao @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage One reason why it took dispys so long to come on the scene is because it is built on a quasi-racialist framework.
@BWSchank @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Christ obeyed the law of God so you do not have to, huh?
@teach_tao @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage "Hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth."

If He hardened me, then it's His fault, not mine!

"Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?"

Dang!
@teach_tao @BWSchank @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage "We are commanded to love God and one another" is the law. Salt&amp;Light rejects that as just being for "the Jews."
@BWSchank @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Yep. I don't steal and I council others not to steal. I'm basically going around forcing people to get circumcised. LOL are you for real?
@teach_tao @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage You sound like the person in error in Romans 9: "WHY DOES HE STILL FIND FAULT?"
@teach_tao @BWSchank @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage A lot of Christians still break the law of God. What are you going to say to them? 

You shouldn't steal!
Why? We aren't under the law.
Well then you shouldn't want to steal!
Why? We aren't under the law.
Uhhh...
@teach_tao @BWSchank @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Without the law of God there is no such thing as sin, and if there's no such thing as sin, then there's nothing to repent of, which is why Salt&amp;Light rejects repentance.
@BWSchank @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Some people smoke cigars other people murder. It's all the same. Christians in the "Age of Grace" can do whatever they want as long as they believe in the finished work of Christ. 

James says nope.
@BWSchank @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage But couldn't you filed that under "Christian liberty"?
@BWSchank @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Well if you think that because you said a prayer when you were sixteen that you can go murdering people because "thou shalt not murder" was just for "the Jews" then roll those dice
@BWSchank @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage That's not my call, but you are rolling the dice. If God didn't want you to take James seriously, then He wouldn't have preserved the letter. It would have been lost to history. He preserved it and expects you to be held accountable for its content. You've got no excuse.
@teach_tao @BWSchank @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage James says that if you go around saying things like "I believe in this correct doctrine and that correct doctrine and all I have to do is have faith and I don't need to have any fruit" then it's a dead faith that can't save. It counts for nothing.
@teach_tao @BWSchank @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I didn't think you did dismiss it. Salt&amp;Light dismisses the book of James as not being for him. He thinks it's just for "the Jews". I know you two are on the same page against reformed theology, but you should know that he only believes that (parts of) Paul is relevant to him.
@teach_tao @BWSchank @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Heather, if you take the book of James seriously and don't dismiss it as just for "the Jews" then you've got nothing to worry about
@BWSchank @weecalvin1509 @teach_tao @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I know that's what you think is true. I'm just pointing out that you're rolling the dice if you walk your talk. You've been warned.
@BWSchank @weecalvin1509 @teach_tao @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage And it does so by telling people not to take the warnings of James seriously. James was emphatic about what actually saves and what is deception, and dispys put their faith in their system rolling the dice with the hopes that James' warnings aren't for them.
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Salvation is the consequence of covenantal communion with Yahweh. It doesn't get more explicit in the case of Abraham.
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Man made? Man centered? How much do you know about the history of YOUR system? https://t.co/FnxAcHqWIW
@ThaRealJgibbs @Billkjv73 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Good morning to you as well. 

I am not just engaging in wild speculation. It's the general assessment of scholars who have actually studied the works of the ancients from various cultures.
@Billkjv73 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Here's the thing: Moses wasn't a modernist or classical liberal. Neither were the prophets or psalmists or Jesus or apostles. So when we take those ideas and pretend they're presuppositions of ancients it is not being a "Bible only" type of guy. It's being a modernist liberal.
@Billkjv73 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Sorry. This was a long about way of saying that I don't think freewill advocates are borrowing from the RCC necessarily. They are dipping into the same historical/ideological trends that the RCC dipped into to get their ideas. It's modernism/(classical) liberalism.
@Billkjv73 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Modern US evangelicals have a different approach: they project their post-Declaration of Independence thoughts about the state on to God. 

He's not King! We elect Him! He can't tell us what to do! We have rights!

It's pretty silly.
@Billkjv73 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I say "anachronistically appear" because they did not truly think like moderns. It was tied to their theologically low view of god(s) being so far off, apathetic, and/or weak that there was no meddling in worldly affairs.
@Billkjv73 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Yep. Freewill in it's purest articulation is a modern phenomenon in the history of human ideas. The ancients didn't really think about it like us. Of those who anachronistically appear to think like moderns are two groups vilified in scripture: the Sadducee and Epicureans.
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage The third person of the trinity was not a NT phenomenon. The HS is all over the OT. The HS inspired the writers and prophets. There were theophanies of the HS. The NT is more about the pouring out of the spirit on a massive scale
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage All the OT rituals were types and shadows that pointed to Christ. It looked forward to that great day just as our rituals (Lord's Supper) look back.
@JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage https://t.co/p1k9RLA3qX
@JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Does a mighty God scare you?
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Yeah, the Reformation emerged out of Roman Catholicism to critique it with a passion. You act like that's a silver bullet or not known to everyone already.
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Lol you dispys have dismissed most of scripture and you wanna lecture
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Woah, "remove the Judaism from him"? It's just worshiping Yahweh, who did something big during Paul's lifetime and decided to use Paul to further the plan that was laid out from the beginning: bringing the world to Yahweh.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I'd have to check my notes, but I believe there was a Jewish expulsion from Rome around that time. It's not that important. The point is Paul was getting down to the basics.
@BWSchank @teach_tao @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Every single genuine conversion is an act of divine intervention from the Trinity working together to bring a person to faith and communion. God is not on vacation. He is running the universe according to His plan.
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage LOL, no. It's called Tanna or Tannaim. It was the common Rabbinic system for passing on knowledge from a Rabbi to a student who would become an authoritative teacher. It's the basis for the Mishnah. Paul's teacher was Jesus, not a human teacher like one of the 12.
@BWSchank @teach_tao @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Casting out demons? Healing? Speaking other known human languages? Prophesying? Visions?
@BWSchank @teach_tao @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Uhh for starters there's scripture written after the road to Damascus. That's a divine intervention unless you don't believe that scripture is inspired.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage It's context. Paul was breaking down all of history into a crash course for people who had no idea about Yahweh. The other writers assumed the readers had a lot more knowledge then Paul.
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage WOW that's a stretch! What Paul is saying is that he didn't sit at the feet of Peter or James or John and memorize their sayings as was typical in the rabbinic system of teaching.
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Types and shadows bro.

@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @teach_tao @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Salvation is Trinitarian and you're not in the Trinity.
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage 1. Good news! I'm bringing home pizza!... 

30 minutes later... 

2. Good news! I'm here with the pizza! 

Chopping these two announcements up into opposing announcements with no connection whatsoever is asinine. 

Don't do that with scripture.
@BWSchank @teach_tao @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage WOW. That's a bold statement.
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Paul was attacking the Galatian heretics and you're setting him against Jesus and the twelve apostles. You don't need to do this.
@BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage If you think Jesus was in opposition to the 12 and the 12 were in opposition to Paul and Paul was in opposition to Jesus, then you don't understand any of them, nor do you understand the scriptures.

@ThaRealJgibbs @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage But very accurate. I'd throw in the word liberal too
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage You don't think the Spirit prevents you from doing things you would have otherwise wanted to do? How does it make you feel that the Spirit is basically trampling on your autonomy?
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Is that how you feel?
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Yahweh took away His Spirit from Saul and sent an evil one so that Saul would mess up and David could get the thrown. Yahweh is the God of history. He does what He pleases. Faith involves trusting in His Wisdom in running all things.
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage From the way anti-Reformed folk talk, what Yahweh did to Pharoah's heart was basically rape.
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage But but but what about autonomous free will?
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 

But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.

Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.

@BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage You act as if He's no longer in control of history.
@pastorErogers @aerich_a @CHSpurgeon Psst the Pilgrims were hardcore Calvinists :)
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage So you think the "age of grace" is characterized by God's abandonment? I couldn't disagree more. I don't expect you to change on it. You're deeply committed to Rapturology
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Yes. God is not on vacation running some other universe. Godless regimes doing godless things is a form of judgment, and instead of seeing it as such, you pretend God is on vacation. SMH
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I know your peculiar brand of eschatology. Don't want to go there, but you asked for an explanation that doesn't involve God going on vacation from running the universe. I gave one. God is in control. He's judging nations and churches.
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Why would God allow King David to sin so publicly and make it completely clear that he wasn't the messiah? Hmm
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Judgment. Germany was the first to go modernist. God took their light stand and they got their judgment. It was horrific. American Churches without light stands will get their own form of judgment.
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Congrats. You've turned Christianity into just another philosophy.
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage 1. It is interesting. It's called regeneration.
2. You need to pick one. Are we driven by our nature or by our free will?
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage You should boast more.
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage You've got the power. Give yourself a pat on the back.
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage That's self-election
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage So humans elect to be elect?
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage It's a sovereign decision. In the final analysis, when viewed in the fullness of God's power, people don't pick their parents. They don't pick to be in the body.
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I believe in corporate election. Some are called into the body via conversion. Others are brought into the body via faithful parents faithfully raising their children into it from childhood. Nobody outside the body (in a non-temporal sense) is elect.
@pastorErogers @aerich_a @CHSpurgeon Desire?
@pastorErogers @aerich_a @CHSpurgeon Cool. Apply that logic to everything else
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I have no idea what you're talking about. We aren't using the same lingo in the same way. We aren't even on the same page of talking about a post Gen 3 world.
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Regeneration excludes even the possibility of rejecting the gospel. That's the point. Unregenerate man hears a sermon and dismisses it. The same man could hear the same exact sermon after regeneration and be struck to his knees.
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Most people who convert have heard the same message many times before, but at some point it clicks. Regeneration is what makes the click possible. It happens before every real conversion. It's hard to describe because it is subconscious, but it happens.
@BWSchank @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage The argument is that once the spirit regenerates the person always gravitates towards belief. Talk to a convert. They will likely tell you that they experienced something difficult to describe just prior to faith. It's the subconscious (regeneration) becoming conscious (faith)
@pastorErogers @aerich_a @CHSpurgeon Is God a hypocrite for judging people who murder people by drowning them in the Red Sea when God drowned the Egyptians in the Red Sea? Please let that sink in: We are not equal with God.
@pastorErogers @aerich_a @CHSpurgeon I already accused you having a non-theological understanding of evil. I just accused you have having a non-theological understanding of hypocrisy. I'm not going down the path with you into category errors that seem to run deep in your man-centered set of assumptions about God.
@pastorErogers @aerich_a @CHSpurgeon You must be very confident that I am wrong because you are playing with fire. You also seem to be misusing the word hypocrite
@pastorErogers @CHSpurgeon @aerich_a I find that hard to believe
@pastorErogers @CHSpurgeon @aerich_a Judgement for sin. Do you just do topical preaching?
@pastorErogers @aerich_a @CHSpurgeon The thief on the cross wasn't an accident of history. He was meant to be there. Like I said don't play around with secret decrees. It is not our business. Just follow the law of God.
@pastorErogers @CHSpurgeon @aerich_a giving people over to lies and delusions is a form of divine judgement
@aerich_a @pastorErogers @CHSpurgeon Prohibitions against stealing are found in the "Old Testament law." Since Jesus didn't steal, did he abolish the prohibition against theft for everyone?
@pastorErogers @CHSpurgeon @aerich_a You're confusing this. I'm saying get out of God's business of how He decides to run the universe. It's not your concern. Soldiers don't need to be in the War Room with the generals. Just follow your orders.
@pastorErogers @CHSpurgeon @aerich_a He doesn't? “The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things that are  revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all  the words of this law." 

God cannot be evil since evil is defined in terms of human rebellion, not in terms of preference.
@TreyMays @SlowToWrite In case of a boring long commute, the audio version might come in handy. https://t.co/KQkrFZDTaA
@pastorErogers @CHSpurgeon @aerich_a It's not an ole defense. It's a commandment. God specifically said mind your own business and don't be a busybody about how He runs the universe. 

Sin and evil exist only within the context of disobeying God. Recognize the hierarchy.
@pastorErogers @CHSpurgeon @aerich_a “The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law."

Don't worry about God's secret decrees. Follow the law.
@BWSchank @BrazenSolomon @thirstynomoreAQ "God does not create people to go hell" is what you said. It sure sounded like a statement about His character. If that is not what you meant please accept my apologies
@BWSchank @BrazenSolomon @thirstynomoreAQ The reason I "dwell" on that is that God's character is the same now as it was in 500 BC and you're making an argument about God's character.
@BWSchank @BrazenSolomon @thirstynomoreAQ I don't have a problem with that. I'm not embarrassed of God. He shows mercy on who He wills. I'm not the lawyer for the reprobate.
@BWSchank @BrazenSolomon @thirstynomoreAQ Could God have sent them prophets if He really wanted to save them all? Yes. Did He? No. Basically not a single person on that continent was in a covenantal relationship with Yahweh, and He did nothing to change that.
@BWSchank @BrazenSolomon @thirstynomoreAQ The year is 500 BC. The place is South America. Where are the prophets of Yahweh?
@BWSchank @BrazenSolomon @thirstynomoreAQ You act like this is somehow out of character for God. Prior to the Great Commission it was not even a point of discussion that the vast majority of humanity was destined for destruction and God was free to do that. Now Christians act like that is weird.

@TrinitarianRick @machenwarrior @EugenicPolemic @XpCoulson The church is essential. Unity is essential. Confessions are essential to unity in the church. It all points to Christ, the king of the church, who wants a united body, not individualistic anarchy

@machenwarrior @EvenWokerPresby @NFjords @presbycast I agree. Aside from one guy I am not aware of this being a major problem in the OPC (it seems to be more of a PCA thing), but it might be good to have some clarity on the issue if it could be handled correctly.
@machenwarrior @EvenWokerPresby @NFjords @presbycast There is a lot of room to disagree. A postmill might accuse an amill of twisting scripture and vise versa. A young earth proponent might accuse a frame worker of twisting scripture and vise versa. We have to avoid setting up kangaroo courts over adiaphora
@machenwarrior @EvenWokerPresby @NFjords @presbycast I would assume so.
@machenwarrior @EvenWokerPresby @NFjords @presbycast In my opinion, Mika is playing with fire, but nothing concrete has been broken that would hold up in a hearing.
@machenwarrior @EvenWokerPresby @NFjords @presbycast Twisting scripture in a way that went against the Westminster Standards   would be grounds for charges, especially in the setting of public worship. However, I believe pastors are allowed to file disagreements with the standards on a point or two.
@machenwarrior @EvenWokerPresby @NFjords @presbycast Well the OPC started as a coalition of Presbyterians disaffected with the PCUSA. It included dispensationalists, evangelicals, confessionalists, etc.. I don't think Machen was super distraught about this at the time of the formation.
@machenwarrior @EvenWokerPresby @NFjords @presbycast Machen had the correct view on prohibition. Biblical law does not forbid alcohol. Those in favor of prohibition were replacing the text with modernist theories. I would argue the same about gun control. However, this isn't heresy. It's symptomatic of something though.

@stevenchoi @theboyonthebike One does not "mature" into a position of affirming false prophets and false miracle workers and false forms of worship. It's not loving. It wasn't loving during the days of Moses when it was executable. It won't be loving when we're in the ground. It isn't now.
@stevenchoi @theboyonthebike Forget the appearance of "haughtiness." I would give up speaking entirely if "vast swaths of global christians" promised to give up this ritualized blasphemy.
@DougInRoc @theboyonthebike It is no question that at least some blasphemously fake it, and people who see it know they blasphemously fake it, but they tolerate the blasphemy because they want to be entertained. It is not worship.
@ncchickers @theboyonthebike I'm not joking or making fun of you. They are meant to overstimulate. Please stay away from those services.
@theboyonthebike Again: what happens when they get bored with inducing temporary madness with all the twitching and babbling and false miracles and false prophecies? What if they start to get embarrassed by Apostolic cosplay?

RT @douglaswils: Any appeal for societal justice that is not explicitly grounded in the law of God is activism in the cause of unholiness.
@EvenWokerPresby @NFjords @presbycast It's symptomatic of something deeper, but in all fairness I strongly doubt this meets the standards for discipline. E.g., Machen was against prohibition, but I highly doubt he'd bring anyone up on charges for voicing an opinion in favor of prohibition.

@JeffPassage @LWKMatt @BroSpencer We sin because we have not yet been perfected by God. Those in heaven do not sin, not because they are mindless puppets, but because they have been radically transformed. Lib free will is foreign to our faith. What we do is an extension of what we are.

@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Okay, so if that's right, why not just say Jesus died to redeem His people? What you are telling people is confusing them.

@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 You just said it! When you consider the terms and conditions, not to mention the names already written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, it is at best deceptive to talk about unlimited atonement.

@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 I'm sorry, but I work in advertising and it would be illegal to run an advert for unlimited atonement and have that many conditions applied to it. Why not just be honest about it? Jesus died to atone for the sins of His people.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 So when you read "And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins" do you see "His people" as the whole world?
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 So when you read: “For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for MANY [i.e., not ALL] for the remission of sins.” What do you think?
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Do you understand the objections to this?
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Yep.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 About a year ago
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 On the lower level, yes. Yes to all of the above.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 You are stuck on the lower level and the very discussion of the upper level clearly confuses you and you lash out. Hasn't that confusion been the root of this entire debate?
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 I could not disagree more. If that's your genuine perspective, then it is perfectly understandable why you have such a problem with reformed thought. Scripture gives us insight into the upper register. Reformed thought expounds on it.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 On the lower register, i.e., forensically speaking in our dimension where time is linear and our understanding is finite, yes. That's only part of the picture though.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Obviously by mentioning Pol Pot I wasn't quoting scripture. I'm making this real. If Christ died for Pol Pot that means he died in Pol Pot's place. That means Pol Pot actually receives Christ's righteousness.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Christ either took the proverbial bullet for Pol Pot and therefore Pol Pot has eternal life or Christ did not jump in front of the bullet to save Pol Pot. Substitutionary atonement requires a real substitution, not platitudes.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 God has love and wrath for Pol Pot. Jesus died for him but not really. Kinda confusing lol
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Wow if you read my tweets so poorly it is no wonder you have such an odd interpretation of scripture
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 God's redemptive love is the theme of the entire Bible.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 I thought that was an answer. He loved us while we were still sinners, because He had a redemptive plan set in place from the beginning. I'd have to do a word study of the use of the word "wrath"
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Simple. He doesn't have redemptive love for the reprobate. That's why limited atonement is the best logical and scriptural answer to your conundrum.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 I'd have to give that some more thought and study but my gut reaction is that there was never a millisecond where God did not know how things would unfold. I didn't surprise Him by submitting to His Lordship.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 That depends as well. Everything I did as an unbeliever culminated ultimately in my belief. Do I believe that it could have went any other way? No. Everything went according to God's plan.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 God is all those things for His people. As for the rebels, He damns them. You've got misplace sympathy https://t.co/os7Ya8khJ2
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 It depends on how much you want to consider it, but if I understand what you're getting at, I'd say the big moment was the cross.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 So how do you limit the unlimited, specific yet universal, everyone but not everyone, all but not all?
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 I am following it. That's your main point is that God is all love and mercy and Jesus paid the price for everyone's sins and Calvinists make God look mean by talking about His power and justice.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 If Jesus was the atonement for Pol Pot then that means God doesn't see his sins. He's singing with the choir right now
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Written during the reign of Nero
@pastorErogers @Unpractical_Man @HacimMb I honestly don't know what you believe. All you do is jump on the internet and blast everyone for what you think they believe and reject correction by the people you are accusing.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 But I thought you were preaching that God was all love and peace signs and mercy to the max for every single person ever
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Jesus didn't die for Pol Pot to show lovey dovy sweet kisses and hugs. Pol Pot will get what he deserves, and if you think what he deserves is God showering mercy and love for all (including Pol Pot) then you have no grasp on Biblical eschatology.
@HacimMb @pastorErogers @weecalvin1509 Exile would be a breath of fresh air compared to what I see. People don't care that they are getting false prophecies. Are they not entertained, though? Because that's what worship is now, entertainment.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 And what of those who give false prophecies after declaring thus says the Lord? Do elders intervene? Are they brought up on charges? I see nothing

@pastorErogers @Unpractical_Man @HacimMb You seem to say we have a hyper individualistic approach so you can poke holes
@pastorErogers @Unpractical_Man @HacimMb Covenant is the means of communing with God. The Kingdom is a giant  covenantal worship service. I get the a sense that you are talking in way too individualistic terms.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 If we started handling these "prophets" like Moses said we should, how many would be jabbering? It would be the end of your movement.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 * God saves sinners
@pastorErogers @Unpractical_Man @HacimMb I'll reiterate: if you want to understand reformed thought you need to  stop thinking in individualistic terms and start thinking in terms of covenant.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 And this is supposed to impress unbelievers how?
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 First off, didn't you just make a case that Romans 9 is about God hating a whole nation? Secondly, God loves His people. How is that not clear from scripture?
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Yes, they understood the real languages that they were really speaking. The one speaking Arabic it would sound like gibberish to me because I don't speak Arabic. To the Arabian it would have made sense because it was a REAL language, not babble.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 The grass accuses the rabbit of being unloving. The rabbit accuses the coyote of being unloving. The coyote accuses the farmer of being unloving. The farmer accuses the banker of being unloving. We all got grievances.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 People understood them on Pentecost. It was supernatural. There's nothing supernatural about idiocy.
@pastorErogers @Unpractical_Man @HacimMb It is all covenant! That's the point of reformed theology. Are you in the covenant or are you out if it? Reprobates want nothing to do with it. God softens the heart of sinners and brings them into the covenant.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Unloving to whom? Unjust to whom? Vile to whom? 

Why do you even think in those terms? 

As a charismatic you probably habitually break the 3rd commandment, but don't you have any fear?
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 I am sorry, but I've never seen anything other that complete mindlessness. It's embarrassing. Unbelievers shouldn't be looking on people speaking in "tongues" and think you are out of your minds, but that is the case 100% of the time. Paul was trying to curb the practice.
@pastorErogers @Unpractical_Man @HacimMb "For nothing"? What are you the Spartacus of reprobates?
@Unpractical_Man @pastorErogers @HacimMb Eric doesn't seem to understand that he is the voice of the objector in this passage, and he doesn't get how offended Paul is by that line of reasoning. It's blasphemous reasoning.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @Unpractical_Man God damned the Egyptian firstborns for what their father did not do (i.e., daddy didn't kill a lamb and put the blood on his house). Look at the law, humans cannot punish the son for the sins of the father, but God has the authority to curse them for multiple generations
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @Unpractical_Man God can kill the Egyptian firstborns. Some random Hebrew slave did not have the authority to go house to house killing Egyptian firstborns. God can read hearts and minds and judge perfectly. Creatures cannot.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Oh really, what language are people talking? Who is translating it? Or maybe, just maybe, quite possibly, it's all mindless self-indulgence
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Talking gibberish and making false prophecies does not glorify God. It's making worship about you and not Him. I find it repulsive.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @Unpractical_Man You continually imply that you don't get the hierarchy and the unbridgeable distinction between creator and creature. A lot of your inability to get what is being said stems from that. Is that from the charismatic tendency to sometimes see themselves a lil gods?
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 The Apostle Paul after talking about how all the stuff charismatics love were coming to an end in the 1st century A.D., writes: "When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways."
@HacimMb @weecalvin1509 @pastorErogers Will do
@HacimMb @weecalvin1509 @pastorErogers What's his deal anyways? Is he a real life ideological Arminian? "Traditionalist" Southern Baptist? Independent Fundamentalist Baptist? A generic pick-n-choose liberal? Catholic? I have no clue. All I know is he hates Reformed theology with a passion
@pastorErogers @HacimMb And if maple isn't allowed into the Kingdom, it wouldn't be unjust for God to prohibit both the sapling and tree from the Kingdom. If He wanted to show mercy, that's His prerogative, but we have zero evidence that He distinguishes between the little wicked and big wicked.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb Listen, I know this is tough stuff, but we're all mature here. We should  be beyond a diet of breast milk and baby food so let's talk like adults. I bet Pol Pot was a cutie pie too when he was a kid, but a maple sapling still grows into a maple tree.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb You mean the same type of cutie pies that our God told Joshua to slay?
@pastorErogers @HacimMb The fall resulted in alienation from God, and the only way back is through entering into a covenant with YAHWEH, not a baby dedication to or a covenant ritual with Maat or Amun-Ra or Hathor
@pastorErogers @HacimMb God took the lives of a bunch of pagan firstborns dedicated to demons, and as they grew up they became more and more like what they worshiped. They were 100% outside of the real covenant and so they received wrath, but you think they were some innocent typological of Christs?
@pastorErogers @HacimMb So God deals out the most explicit form of Divine Judgement possible on people in order to send them to heaven? That sounds more like a religious sacrifice, not judgement.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb Scripture is clear on Esau. Answer my question.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb So God kills the cute little Egyptian cuddle muffins for having Egyptian rather than Jewish parents (in order to show mercy to His people) then what happens? You think God put the little pagans in heaven? What if He didn't show them mercy in the afterlife? Would that be okay?
@pastorErogers @HacimMb Did the little cute Egyptian children have a choice in their parents? Nope. Nevertheless, they were still killed, and it was to show God's power and God's glory. Are you really okay with that?
@pastorErogers @HacimMb I suspect you don't like to think about it, but that's our God, who we worship as totally loving to His people and praise as totally just. You need to grapple with what is your authority: scripture (including the stuff that gets raw) or your own determinations. Food for thought.
@pastorErogers @HacimMb Keep in mind that God took the lives of tiny little cute Egyptian children saying goo goo gaa gaa. Why? Because their parents did not kill a lamb and paint their house with lamb's blood. Does God have the authority to do that? Can you judge God for that?
@pastorErogers @HacimMb Are you sure about that? You are bringing up the same arguments that unbelievers bring up when they charge God with being unjust and unloving. How do you feel about the wiping out the Egyptian first born? Is that loving and just in your view?
@pastorErogers @HacimMb Who are you? Who do you think you are? By what authority do you bring a charge?
@HacimMb @pastorErogers Three forms of unity is alright with me :)
@pastorErogers @HacimMb You seem to think doing bad stuff is the basis. A person paralyzed from the head down might not do anything but still be reprobate in his heart
@Soapbox_Atheist Wow, there are a lot of atheists straying from the agreed upon script.  In case you forgot, the script is "We aren't suppressing the truth! We  don't hate God! How can we hate something that does not exist?" Not, "I  hate God so I'll pretend He doesn't exist."
@PresbyPolemics @taylorderek I was raised by atheists so I have a conversion experience, but I know many people who were raised by Godly paedobaptists who never had a conversion experience. They simply grew and deepened in their faith and understanding
@PresbyPolemics @taylorderek I was wondering the same thing. It sounded almost like part of the argument against infant baptism is that it deprives the person of a precious experience, and the experience is paramount.
@taylorderek @PresbyPolemics If that's the case, then nobody should get baptized as long as they live under the roof their parents, because parents have legitimate authority over children, and children must honor their parents. In order to avoid any confusion, wait until marriage to get baptized.
@taylorderek @PresbyPolemics I understand that the experience of applying for citizenship, studying for citizenship, and finally receiving citizenship is probably pretty cool, but if your parents are already citizens and they raise you to be a citizen, I don't see the point of hoop jumping for an experience

@NorCalGeekDad @DAL9001 @realDonaldTrump PCA and OPC aren't mainline, but it does get to what I was referring: there's a difference between confessional protestants and evangelicals. It's always existed and grew exponentially since the 2nd great awakening.
@DAL9001 @NorCalGeekDad @realDonaldTrump In the ones that went mainline, for instance, the PCUSA, I'd guess that less than 1% has a rudimentary knowledge of the Westminster Standards. They aren't reformed though.
@DAL9001 @NorCalGeekDad @realDonaldTrump It depends. In the PCA or OPC I'd guess the number was pretty high. They learn the catechisms pretty early. The confession is read communally during services. It's referred to in sermons.
@NorCalGeekDad @realDonaldTrump You announced to the whole world that you had a profound revelation and you also think that expressing them in clear fashion is something not to get hung about. I think I understand what what's going on here.
@NorCalGeekDad @realDonaldTrump Well you're making a theological argument using sociological terms that ignore theological distinctions and it doesn't work if your goal is to actually understand the motivations for why people do what they do.
@NorCalGeekDad @realDonaldTrump The Westminster Confession of Faith is a go to source for Calvinist doctrine. You have to understand how you sound to people who know this stuff, i.e., you sound like someone who skimmed a wikipedia page
@NorCalGeekDad @realDonaldTrump Evangelical is a distinct category from the confessionally reformed. One is not a subset of another. Evangelicals don't generally believe in "total depravity." I'd guess they voted the way they did because one candidate reached out to them and the other did the opposite.

@RedeemedRutland I honestly don't see any difference between a woke PCA member and any random PCUSA member.
@RedeemedRutland It's not the reading the pagan lit that is important. It is making that lit axiomatic. This school of thought views the Christian worldview as completely abrogated by the new prophetic pagan voices in academic circles. Pagans have much to teach us. We have nothing to teach them.

@teach_tao @thirstynomoreAQ @ramauser Okay, I read it and my hot take is that the author is puffed up in his self-inflicted ignorance. Scripture assumes that the reader will notice the symbolism. It practically jumps off the page. Don't be scared of it.
@teach_tao @thirstynomoreAQ @ramauser so how do you get access to the blood in a non-symbolic way?
@teach_tao @thirstynomoreAQ @ramauser you seem to think symbolic is inferior. I disagree. Spiritual info is best explained via symbols
@teach_tao @thirstynomoreAQ @ramauser So you think it would look different under a microscope?
@teach_tao @thirstynomoreAQ @ramauser if I agreed with you I would focus on hunting for Jesus relics
@teach_tao @thirstynomoreAQ @ramauser he was fully human in his concrete body
@teach_tao @thirstynomoreAQ @ramauser But you do not have access to his concrete plasma from a Jesus blood bank. The symbolism is bigger!
@teach_tao @thirstynomoreAQ @ramauser Lamb blood did not forgive sin via magic. It was symbolic in that it foreshadowed Christ's death
@teach_tao @thirstynomoreAQ @ramauser Jesus cursing the fig tree would be pointless outside the symbolism.
@teach_tao @thirstynomoreAQ @ramauser Symbolism is never "mere symbolism." Symbols are bigger than the concrete. Jesus had human blood.
@teach_tao @ramauser @thirstynomoreAQ Please learn about symbolism. It is one of the most important aspects for understanding our faith. This fundamentalist anti-intellectualism confuses people into superficiality. God is communicating great mysteries to us through the richness of His symbols.
@teach_tao @ramauser @thirstynomoreAQ Do you drink real blood at the Lord's supper?
@teach_tao @ramauser @thirstynomoreAQ I don't even know what you want to debate. What's your position? That blood doesn't symbolize anything in the Bible? If that is your position. I'm sorry, but that is completely absurd.
@teach_tao @ramauser @thirstynomoreAQ Well please don't read Jesus' comments about being a door. Your head might explode.
@teach_tao @ramauser @thirstynomoreAQ If you can't identify symbolism, then you need stop whatever it is you are doing and learn how symbolism works. Do not pick up your Bible until you understand symbolism. The book is worthless to you if you don't get it how symbolism works.

@EvenWokerPresby @JemarTisby  Good question
@Calvinism_Cap @stigmata_laudis That method would make Van Til sick, and Keller knows it so he tries to take the PCUSA's hermeneutic and baptize with his "orthodox" credentials. It's the same thing that happened a century ago and it's happening again. The PCA is in trouble :(
RT @VirginiaBeachOP: Why does the OPC exist today as a distinct branch of the visible church? Find out here: https://t.co/LhGMllLazb
@Calvinism_Cap @stigmata_laudis His hermeneutic is not Kuyperian or Van Tillian or Calvinist. I see it as essentially the same as the PCUSA's hermeneutic method of seeing the living God's wisdom being carried along by the philosophy of the age. The heathens are the prophets. We must learn from them.
@Calvinism_Cap @RichardRicoba Many (not all) believe in the Kingdom of God-Heaven distinction. They would all reject the idea that they don't know how to read the Bible. They think they have the decoder ring about what sections to "rightly divide" out of the book. What I said would be deeply offensive to them
@Calvinism_Cap @stigmata_laudis Keller has been sneaky about it. He also claims Cornelius Van Til and John Calvin. He dresses himself up with the most orthodox bibliography and proceeds to trample all over it with secular presuppositions. It's just for show. It's a salad bar to him.
@Calvinism_Cap @RichardRicoba Yes. Historically that has generally been the case. The Scofield Reference Bible was the jam of the early Fundamentalist movement. They thought dispensationalism helped explain and justify losing and dropping out of culture entirely. Satan was still on his thrown.
@Calvinism_Cap @stigmata_laudis The "woke" crowd thinks Kuyper was the biggest racist in the world and that he, with a single hand, invented apartheid in South Africa. They aren't fanboys.
@Calvinism_Cap @RichardRicoba Oh and when the crypto-Marxist says their opponents have a truncating  Gospel, I interpret that as a sneaky way of likening us to  dispensationalists, who have literally truncated the gospels. It's not a  compliment.
@Calvinism_Cap @RichardRicoba And because they don't know how to read the Bible, many believe that the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of Heaven are two totally distinct things.
@Calvinism_Cap @RichardRicoba Jesus came on to the scene announced the good news of the kingdom of God. Dispensationalists believe that humans foiled God's plans for the kingdom by rejecting Jesus. Now there is no kingdom growing like a mustard seed, only a mysterious paranthetical age
@RichardRicoba @Calvinism_Cap because they reject the kingdom in every form. They just want to get beamed out

@Krinks1234 @JackmanRobert @dustinbenge I don't see the word "choice." I see stuff about election and predestination and called to faith and drawn by the Father, etc., etc., etc., but none of that supports your claim.
@Krinks1234 @JackmanRobert @dustinbenge where does it say "choice"?
@Krinks1234 @JackmanRobert @dustinbenge Same thing as Justin. He was raised by pagans. Plus, he probably didn't have the whole Bible. Why is this surprising?
@Krinks1234 @JackmanRobert @dustinbenge Yes. He was raised pagan and embraced all the neo-pagan philosophies about Free Will and he probably never read the entire Bible. What do you expect?
@tomlinson_fran @TalbertSwan @gotmtv @realDonaldTrump #JesusWasATheocrat
@Krinks1234 @JackmanRobert @dustinbenge The Sadducee rejected scripture and the supernatural and believed in Free Will. They were heretics. No orthodox worshiper of Yahweh at the time of Jesus believed in Free Will. They all believed in Divine Providence.
@Krinks1234 @JackmanRobert @dustinbenge Pagans believed in fate and then they started calling it superstitious so they started playing with the neo-pagan idea of Free Will. People like Clement picked that up from them. It's not from scripture.
@Krinks1234 @JackmanRobert @dustinbenge Scripture clearly teaches that people do what they are. Fig trees produce figs. Olive trees produce olives. Goats act like goats. Sheep act like sheep. Adulterers commit adultery because it is what they are in their heart. You do what you are. You don't make yourself.
@Krinks1234 @JackmanRobert @dustinbenge Clement is not thinking clearly. Read the context. He clearly got sucked into Greek philosophical discussions (e.g., the writings of Socrates) and he unwittingly accepted their unbiblical presuppositions and categories to create an argument that is untethered by scripture.
@Krinks1234 @JackmanRobert @dustinbenge If you want to expand (i.e., redefine) the definition of fate to include a monotheist conception of Divine Providence acting in human history, then yes I will reject that attempt to redefine basic categories.
@Krinks1234 @JackmanRobert @dustinbenge If this the author who taught you that the Reformed view of God's Sovereignty is the pagan conception of fate, then I'll have to pass over it as either uninformed or slanderous.
@Krinks1234 @JackmanRobert @dustinbenge You seem to be equating predestination and providence with fate.
@RRuiz1689 @cwhisonant @brianonstead Covenantal baptism didn't exist prior to the cross putting an end to all  previous forms of blood covenant. Jesus would have assumed the male  children were circumcised on the 8th day, i.e., before they professed a desire to be in a covenant.

@AFreThought @InstaCalebM @C_Stroop I'm a Reformed. Sovereignty is kind of a big deal.
@allison_of_troy @xdoublestar @C_Stroop What makes you think I wasn't joyfully deploying sarcasm? :)
@AFreThought @InstaCalebM @C_Stroop This thread is filled with #EmptyThePews #ExEvangelicals. They are not sick of going to a particular lame church. They are sick of it all. They have an entire identity formed around their apostasy. They consider it essential to their sense of self.
@AFreThought @InstaCalebM @C_Stroop * crickets *
@AFreThought @InstaCalebM @C_Stroop Maybe I misjudged the situation. Who said that?
@Splumner @LauraJanespoon @brchastain @C_Stroop I'll play along. So if we throw out the Bible and the imperatives that we derive from the Bible (which become our "preferences") we are left with what? Following Anoetos Greyfield as our guru?
@AFreThought @InstaCalebM @C_Stroop Let's back up a second. Look at what has preceded this moment. Most of the people coming at me are not saying "hey, I'm a Christian!" They are saying Christianity is an oppressive fairy tale and people need to became liberated by apostatizing.
@AFreThought @InstaCalebM @C_Stroop You have misread me. I said people who lack in faith tend to apostatize. If they apostatize, then they become apostates. If that doesn't describe you, then I'm not talking about you.
@AFreThought @InstaCalebM @C_Stroop I agree that calling a person an apostate when they are not is wrong. Who have I wrongly accused?
@Splumner @LauraJanespoon @brchastain @C_Stroop Those are some pretty harsh words. I'm in the OPC and the people in my fellowship would be appalled at breaking the first three commandments, and they'd want to know how that could be.
@AFreThought @InstaCalebM @C_Stroop LOL a martyr of the mute button?
@AFreThought @InstaCalebM @C_Stroop Calling someone an apostate is not like calling someone a "poo poo head." It's a spiritually clinical term that many of the people coming at me wholeheartedly embrace. It's not meant to be offensive, and I'm not bullying. I think apostates should apostatize instead of #PlayChurch
@InstaCalebM @AFreThought @C_Stroop Mute me. That would be symbolically pregnant with meaning :)
@allison_of_troy @xdoublestar @C_Stroop There's no problem. In order to avoid such misunderstandings in other encounters you should be aware that "touching a raw nerve" is a colloquialism that should not be taken formally or in a wooden literal sense.

@Caitlin_Venable @dan_carmell @C_Stroop @LauraJanespoon @brchastain BTW I don't think it qualifies as a "break out." People just go from one subculture to another. Without God, there's nothing transcendent about it. Anthropologically speaking, most of you #EmptyThePews sound more or less the same.

@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton If you take scripture as the highest authority, there is a profound inconsistency. If you take yourself as the highest authority, then there is no contradiction. You can pick and choose what you like, but then that means you see yourself as a higher authority than God.
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Do you understand the concept of defilement?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton That's about the Genesis creation account. That's a particular form of literature that isn't under discussion. We are talking about the law. Nobody would tell a police officer that the speed limit is allegorical or only intended for people that are really bad people.
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton If one has all sorts of invisible loopholes and the other does not, either the invisible loopholes are bogus or we are just bigots against bestiality for no real reason other than we personally think it is gross and we are more comfortable being inconsistent on that issue.
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It was intended as a comparison. It was intended as a method of interpretation.
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Okay, so you would say that according to the verse the feelings aren't explicitly condemned, but the action is?
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I mean it's pretty clear, and that's not even about abusing the animal. It's to avoid making "yourself unclean with it [the animal]" So even if the well being of the animal was not a consideration, it would still be wrong.
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Just imagine for a second that someone really liked bestiality and wanted to argue that it was about abuse and they were only laying with dead animals, and there is no command against that. Would that fly as a proper interpretation/application?
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Interesting, but I will ask again: If the phrase was "you shall not lie with an animal as with a woman," is this not necessarily about bestiality?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm humoring you.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Okay, this is an incredibly specific command. 

Now let's see if maybe there are some exceptions to the rule elsewhere in scripture.

Okay, there's none.

Hmm let's look at other less clear verses and see if they support or complicate matters.

Well, it's 100% consistent.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "a woman" meaning female human

"it" referring to the action just described

"is" meaning equals

"an abomination" meaning a special form of repulsive sin
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "I am the Lord." Means the speaker is declaring His Divinity and Authority.

"You" meaning human males

"shall not" an explicit negative command

"lie" meaning sexual relations

"with" meaning accompanying

"a male" meaning human male

"as with" meaning in the same manner as
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It's not up for debate. God said it. The case is closed.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton In other words, nothing will convince you and you'll find a way to wiggle out of everything by pointing to one source that simply expanded the definition to include certain heterosexual stuff and pretend that it changes everything. You've got an agenda.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Puberty is not sinful.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton A loving family is not sinful. "I am the Lord. You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination."
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton So you would be shocked if presented with evidence of execution of two male "lovers" in which no rape was alleged?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Not at all. I want them in the Kingdom of God, but that will not be their fate if they keep on the of sin.
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton If the phrase was "you shall not lie with an animal as with a woman," is this not necessarily about bestiality?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Yes it does match. What does the history of the saints show about those caught, who "lie with a male as with a woman"? Did they give them the keys to the city? Or did something much messier happen?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "I am the Lord. You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination." This is clear. You have blinders on if you don't see that. How could it be any clearer? How?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I raised the issue of the myth of neutrality because you embrace it axiomatically.
@absalomedia @omeagoz @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It was a rhetorical question that was making a parody of you saying it is somehow up for debate.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I should have brought it up before, but this picture is essentially  the position you've taken  with regards to LGBT stuff in the Bible.  "We've figured it out after thousands of years of years!" Which one is Matthew Vines?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "I am the Lord. You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination." How is this open for debate? If you don't like it, you might have your worldview catered to more in another religion.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton No. I am actively mocking you and your delusion of neutrality.
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Okay. I'm going to assume you don't know the Biblical languages and give you a very respected translation from the Word of God: "I am the Lord. You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination." How do you interpret that?
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Atheists aren't good at reading the Bible. Take a deep breath and try again.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It's the words on the page. It's the words in the Torah. It's the words in the Prophets. It's the words in the Writings. It's words in the NT. They aren't LGBTI affirming. In fact, they are explicitly hostile to advancing that pagan agenda. You're gonna have to do something more.

@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton And yet the scientific online community published it and shared to everyone as if wasn't simple god haters masking their agenda behind "science." This is the world we live in. It is not neutral.

Nothing existed before Him. 

There's one God.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Oh well in that case let's just burn the Bible as a hate crime or go through and edit it all out because people who are rebelling against themselves are hurting themselves. 

Nope. They need God's word.

@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton You buy into this myth of neutrality. Did you know I saw an article recently where scientists have proven to their own satisfaction that everyone who believes in a higher power suffers from a mental condition? Do you not see what's happening or are you gonna call a doctor?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton LOL it's 2018. Everyone with a flat screen thinks they're oppressed because their neighbor has a bigger one so now we're calling envy and covetousness a fight for justice. Give me a break. You've got the wrong categories.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton LOL it does match perfectly! This isn't some mystery. The sexual revolution happened and people wanted to start being slick in the scholarship. It's not neutral. It's agenda driven. Neutrality is a myth.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton That Shlomo guy is a joke. He's an atheist communist who is all about destroying Israel, and he just so happened to write that garbage you presented to me as reputable. You and him are speaking the same language. We aren't
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton You know God exists but you habitually suppress that truth because you like your unrighteousness. God's existence isn't up for debate. God is axiomatic.
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton God defines sin. God defines homosexual activity as a tier one level sin, i.e., an abomination. People engaging in that need to repent for all their sins and get right with God.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton God's standards repel you. God hating secularists at war with God's standards draw you in like a moth to a flame. You and I are on different teams. You're #PlayingChurch if you even do that every now and then.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton But you don't do that too! Here's the distinction: You base you limitations on whatever is the fad among the crypto-Marxists and I set the limits based on God's standards.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Why are you so drawn to these God haters and repelled by those who should be your brothers and sisters in Christ? It definitely shows your allegiances.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Again. 1. You say something heretical based on external secular sources hostile to God. 2. I point it out. 3. You change the subject.
@JohnC64 @omeagoz @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton God exists. He has spoken in history. He has instructed His people to call everyone to repent of their sins and get right with Him.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I agree there a lot of traditions and flavors and styles that can all be filed under historic Christianity. They are brothers and sisters. I don't think anyone has a perfect theology in this life. However, there are basic standards that seem allergic to you.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton WOW! Do you have any more atheist Marxists with an axe to grind against God to tell me about theology?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton What more do you want? You say some heretical comment based solely from an external secular worldview hostile to historic Christianity, then I point that out, and then you change the subject. That's been the back and forth.
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Sin is harmful
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Wow you found an odd duck with a taste for German. I don't know his deal. Don't get me started on SBTS
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton LOL those are the bell bottoms that keep coming back whenever people don't like the law. German atheists thinking German atheist thoughts and writing them down. It's entirely speculative.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton That's not how it looks to me. You're just some fad jumper hopping on the latest atheistic progressive ad campaign. You like their trendy movement and you toss out God to be seen as hip to it. It's capitulation.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton So you equate supporting some completely unscriptural social practices with opposition to some completely unscriptural social movements. This isn't about petty political movements. In the US we have the choice of a party of atheistic Marxians or atheistic Ayn Randians
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I did not realize that, because it is entirely unfounded speculation on your part. I don't see the need to boast of my Kingdom activities. I live in pretty poor area of the city. There's a lot of work being done and more needs to be done, but that's not the issue under discussion
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Says who?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I don't think it bodes well for the imposters pretending to be Christians but are actually promoting abominations. In the past, they would say "I got a revelation from an angel!" but now they say "I got a revelation from pagan social scientists!" It's all in the open.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm talking about the composition. I am not talking about snapping a finger into utopia. I am a postmillenial so I believe Jesus will put his enemies under his feet, including the imposters promoting lawlessness as Godliness ;)
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Dude, you are so impressionable. You hop on what are equivalents of intellectual bell bottoms, little mind fads, the latest idea fashions every blog and magazine is talking about. Whatever you think you hold on to today could be one campaign away from horrific to you the next day
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I am not asking myself. I have been asking you, directly, for some time now.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton You operate under the same presuppositions as the scholars. You eat up their material because you see it as a neutral worldview when it is in fact heavily invested with presuppositions about the impossibility of a Sovereign God. You seem very easily swayed by all the wrong types.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton If you reject what I've said, then there is no way the Mosaic literature could predate the Babylonian period, because how could Moses have known or guessed correctly about future events? It's impossible in world that is assumed to be without a Sovereign God.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton This means that prophecy is not post facto pretending to be before the fact, nor is prophecy just a lucky guess/coincidence. Prophecy is a direct sign from a Sovereign God of the universe of His authority.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Here's where I'm coming from: God is sovereign over the structure of the universe and diachronic history. Since God is triune, He is able to do something more than lecture from up high down to a stenographer. The Spirit of God can indwell in a writer and guide them perfectly
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton You want to be loved by the pagans. It won't happen. It's just capitulation :(
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Your (3) would be a subset of (2). It's atheist hermeneutics
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It wouldn't lend credibility to my claim ACCORDING to you, because you've already rejected the most basic presuppositions of Christianity. You're wandering without a tether being tossed around by new studies from our haters. They've done a bang up job with you. You've capitulated
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton You don't get it? Since Moses predicted the Babylonian captivity, we'd have have to either (1.) assume that either God exists and knows the future or (2.) reject God and insist that they are forgeries written after the events took place to appear prophetic. Which sounds godless?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Why not just apostatize instead of continuing what appears to be a charade?
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Agree. 

Agree.

Disagree.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Your method of deconstructing the text into your own image would require an utter lack of clarity. You can't be surprised that it strikes others as a highly selective tendency to play confused when it suites your needs.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton What's your deal then? Why do you even bother identifying yourself with something that you obviously see as nothing more than a Rorschach Test with no real there to be found other than our own narcissistic desires?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Ah so the text is simply a reflection of ourselves. Death of the Author. Death of God. Solid depravity!
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Is there no limit to your capitulation? That's the theory of the radical godless skeptics, and they do so on the basis that prophecy would require the supernatural, and since the supernatural doesn't exist, the text must have been written after the events of the prophecy.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton you think Leviticus was written almost a thousand years after Moses died?
@JohnC64 @omeagoz @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton If you thought I implied it, then I am voicing my objection to your interpretation
@JohnC64 @omeagoz @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Did I say that? Nope. zzzzz
@JohnC64 @omeagoz @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Yes, there's a lot of rape in the animal world. However, they instinctually know they've gotta reproduce, and that reproducing is awesome.
@omeagoz @absalomedia @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton If every panda embraced their natural and normal self as you see it, then there would be no more pandas.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Are you a Unitarian?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Much more than that. His view of scripture was mountains higher than the position you've laid out for yourself.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton So it is your position that scripture is just a collection of people philosophizing about their conception of God and divine inspiration doesn't exist by way of the Holy Spirit?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton If they are wired for that, why did Moses persecute them so hard? Obviously God wouldn't tell him to call them abominations and call for their death, so obviously Moses must have been hearing voices in his head.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Whose mistakes? Paul's? Jesus'? Moses'? Who should I learn from? Darwin?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I don't think you understand what I mean about God's timeless law.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Jesus thought of the scripture as inerrant, but that was silly right?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Where's the line?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton And therefore that means what?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Ohh so God's law evolves along with the atheist morality and knowledge and it is just an illusion that you've completely capitulated to the godless culture?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton No doubt they haven't shown that! But what if they did? You've capitulated to them thus far, where's the line?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton So your point is what exactly?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm asking about God's law. God's law says having sex with animals is unlawful. Can science abrogate that law?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton LOL you are too much! You're twisting my words. I'm trying to keep this PG dude
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton What on earth are you talking about? It was a simple question and you responded with something completely out of left field to change the subject.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton They overthrew God's timeless law?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I am married. If it was about chasing pleasure, then that's just hedonism. Sex is a beautiful gift designed for a certain context.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Suicides is a sin. People who are the biggest rebels against God are more likely to commit it. It's not a coincidence.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It'll be a great day! However while I on earth the order is to be fruitful and multiply in the way God designed us. That's location of sex within that proper, covenantal institution. It's not about loving pleasure.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton That just avoided my question. I'll ask again: Can anti-Christian scientists hide behind their degrees and legitimately overthrow God's timeless law?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton King Saul rebelled against God and committed suicide. Judas rebelled against God and he committed suicide. Pilate rebelled against God and he committed suicide. The Jewish zealots rebelled against God and persecuted God's people and they committed mass suicide. Should I be upset?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I didn't say that.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Men are born sinful. You don't think Jesus had a problem with sinfulness?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Jesus gave the law to Moses
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Ohh so pagan medicine can overthrow God's timeless law? Is that how things work?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It is in the NT. Jesus' resurrection didn't abolish chromosome configurations of male and female. It did not abolish gender roles in society. It didn't allow one to will oneself out of the God given body. Nothing changes.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I don't know if the law addresses hermaphrodites. I would assume they would be considered not marriage material by the wider society without Moses having to say a thing and that could account for not addressing it.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "But wait! The people who are trans don't like the law saying that! They don't like it in the NT! They say it is unloving! They say it is denying their humanity! They say it causes suicide! Can't we rewrite the Law of God so we aren't bigots?" 

Nope.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Being trans is forbidden by the Law of God established in the Torah and continued into the New Covenant.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton If you mean a hermaphrodite, nobody thinks that's sinful.

Trans is another example of rebelling against God's natural order.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton You misunderstand me. I don't lay with my wife when she's menstruating. That's weird.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Do I believe God's standards clearly prohibit sin? YES. EMPHATICALLY YES. A THOUSAND TIMES YES. "Wait wait wait, but does that apply if the person who sins will likely feel unhappy about it being called a sin, and maybe even suicidal?" Nothing changes.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton What are you talking about? “You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness while she is in her menstrual uncleanness." You act like this is some weird command. Is this really a thing people do?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton On what grounds? How about God's Standards! What Christian talks like this?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton No. He called them back to proper obedience to scripture that clashed with their fuzzy emotions above love
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Levirate law is "if a married man died without children, it was the duty of a brother or other near relative to marry the widow"
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Absolutely
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm showing you Paul's hermeneutics. He looked at Lev 18 and he looked at what was going on in Corinth and he put a stop to it even though the congregation thought it all love and a blessing. They have the same problem as you, apparently.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Listen. It's all about the love, right? If they loved each other wouldn't they be fulfilling the law even if it went against Lev 18? Paul did not see it that way. He called it an abomination. He called out the Church for celebrating it. What else is in Lev 18? Oh yeah sodomy
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Don't go conflating those two categories. For starters.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Could you do me a favor and look up Levirate law to make sure you are talking about the same thing. There's nothing criminal about the Levirate law.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton ... but what about the love? What about the stability? What's wrong with that? Paul isn't with you. Nobody in scripture is with you. You are with the world and you want their love. Good luck with that.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father's wife. And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you." 1 Cor 5...
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Do I need to give a proof text barrage about transgenderism? Surely you know what the whole council of God bears witness to, right? 

It sounds like your questioning God's wisdom and challenging His Law. 

Does worldly approval mean that much to you?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton They did not need to spell out to the people that unlawful sexual relations that were called abominations can never be proper expressions of holy love. It was axiomatic. It was common sense. It went without saying.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Here's what I've done: 

1. I shown the law that spells it out in unambiguous terms, i.e., no exceptions. 
2. I showed the continuation of the law into the New Covenant. 
3. I showed that proper love is not lawless, but in conformity to God's timeless law.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Are you messing with me? Have you not read that He Who made them in the first place made them man and woman?  It says, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will live with his wife. The two will become one.’  So they are no longer two but one.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton The saints believed that what you call love is an abomination. You are just scared of the pagans thinking you're backwards idiot who believes in the sky daddy. It seems you are super keen on getting their approval.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Exactly! You seem to acknowledge that scripture makes distinctions about proper and improper love. That was the point of the proof texts. I wanted you to see that. How are things deemed proper vs. improper? God's standards that are clearly spelled out in the law.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton They don't have magisterial power and they'll be judged for acting outside of their position, but that doesn't make one the good guy and the other a bad guy.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton That's what makes the claim of bandwagon accusation so amazing. It's a "bandwagon" that has gone untouched for over a millennium. You're jumping on the fad because you are afraid to stand for God's word.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm applying your logic consistently, and you just laugh dismissively without explanation. Here's the thing: you only want to apply that methodology to one thing because you are afraid of the pagan culture calling you a bigot according to their standards. It's moral cowardliness.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton But they loved money and all love is from God and if you love money it must be because it's an expression of the image of God, right?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton What part of "I am the Lord. You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination" do you not understand?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. (Rev 22)
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good." (Romans 12)
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you." (John 15)
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "For they [Pharisees ] loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God." (John 12)
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life." (John 12)
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil." (John 3)
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me." (Matt 10)
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton An overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. ... With all dignity keeping his children submissive (1 Tim 3)
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed him. And he said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God. (Luke 16)
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Now therefore hear this, you lover of pleasures,
    who sit securely,
who say in your heart,
    “I am, and there is no one besides me"
...
But evil shall come upon you,
    which you will not know how to charm away (Isaiah 47)
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money... disobedient to their parents... unholy ... without self-control... not loving good, treacherous, reckless... lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power." 2 Tim 3
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton This is what an average page looks like in the Catechism. The page is mostly scriptural citations. The citations are drawn from all of scripture and tied to a concise summary of belief. The standards are not scripture, but they are derived from it. https://t.co/EXJus7fgrj
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Scripture is not silent on proper vs. improper love. It's in the law. I love my mother. Can I love my mother improperly? Yes. I love my best friend. Does that mean anything goes? No. I love my neighbor and his wife. Do I get to define how I show my love for his wife? No.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Okay, now were are getting somewhere. The one who lusts doesn't get to redefine it as love. The distinction lies in God's Law, not man's twisted brain, which is able to rationalize anything for selfish ends.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I must have lost you. Our ultimate authority is not the confessions or catechisms.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Scripture is special revelation
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I must have lost you somewhere. God defines proper love. God defines the proper expression of proper love. People who reject God also reject God's definition of love and make up their own definition. Their self-made definitions are rejected as sin.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I have not claimed any special revelation outside of scripture. We don't view the confessions or catechisms to be on par with Scripture. Our standards (when seen in print) are like 90% scriptural citations
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton https://t.co/MDNHzJhXB8
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton When I talk about the second commandment is that just a cover to hate on pagans? What about when I talk about the 8th Commandment? Am I just hiding behind it as an excuse to hate on thieves?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I am confessionally reformed. I do not have an irrational hatred or phobia of the Roman or Greek Church. Having said that, the sole authority for doctrine and theology is scripture. When a particular early Christian is right, it is right because it is scriptural.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I know the type of people you are referring to. I am not one of them.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton My interpretation is no different from classical interpretations. I recognize that when John writes about agape love being of and coming from God he isn't talking about the definition of love as defined by depraved, God-hating pagans.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton The Greeks who wallowed in it collapsed. The Romans who wallowed in it collapsed into chaos until Constantine came around.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Ohh so you can sprinkle some Jesus on sodomy and that makes it all good? How about any of those other sins? You know that doesn't work. You're being slippery.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton In the Jewish-Christian worldview everything is theological. The act is presented typologically and rhetorically as pure rebellion against God and His created order and this is presented as accompanying other abominations in general sense.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton People were doing sodomy in the temples. They were doing it above the taverns. They were doing it in palaces of rulers. They were doing it in the fields. They were doing it in the academy. I think you're missing the point:
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Where's the money??? Where's the abuse??? It's men who bed other men. Stop being slippery.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "For if their laws are righteous, their gods are  unrighteous, since they transgressed the law in killing one another, and practising sorcery, and committing adultery, and in robbing and stealing, and in lying with males, and by their other practises." Apology of Aristides
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I just gave the quote. Where's the money???? It's a list of sins including men who abuse the natural order by bedding other men.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton And that somehow means that it doesn't mean men who bed with other men?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Yes, yes, but like I said they never give the quotes. I just gave the one from Acts of John and it has nothing to do with economics. Your source is deceptive. Where's the quotes?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "Let the murderer know ... punishment is laid up for him twofold after his departure... Likewise also thou poisoner, sorcerer, robber, defrauder, sodomite [arsenokoitai], thief, and as many as are of that band, ye shall come at last... unto unquenchable fire" (Acts of John)
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm open to the possibility that this anti-LGBTI conspiracy exists for thousands of years and everyone was in on it until just recently.

People talk of the 77 other usages, but they never quote them. Why don't you share some?
@JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @GeorgeSaadi @vanbadham @LyleShelton "God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men" Rom 1
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Yes. The context is abundantly clear. There's no debate among anyone who isn't a heretic.
@omeagoz @absalomedia @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Did you skip biology 101?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton But that's not what the word means. If it were, then they'd use the masculine form of prostitute and tie it to the word temple. 

Paul was referring to Lev 18, which does not say: men can sleep with men as long as it isn't in the context of idolatry at the pagan temple.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Philo didn't use the same word as Paul, but it was similar
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Of those 77 most clearly mean what Paul means: ancient homosexuals
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton So there was a massive conspiracy to cover up the fact that the word for men who bed other men doesn't actually mean men who bed other men and the people we can trust to translate it to mean something untranslatable tend to all be gay activists?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Paul takes the Septuagint trans of Lev18:22 which mentions men + bed and puts them together to give his word for homosexual a distinctly Lev18 feel. The vast majority of texts clearly refer to homosexuals. Do they all? No. Was it a reflection of Greek hyperbolic polemic? Probably
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Yes, Paul invented a new word by combining two words that have a common heritage in the Septuagint. Other writers used the term or a variation of it centuries later and seemed to give it a modified meaning. What writers did centuries later doesn't change the meaning of Paul.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Did they stumble upon some new manuscripts? Why the change? It's simple: they are selling out to popular pagan culture and they are tired of being accused of bigotry and since they don't care for scripture much anyhow, they shipped the Bible to the chopping block.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Paul wasn't alone. Jesus' brother Jude spoke of the damnable sin of pursuing unnatural forbidden flesh. If I am in the wrong, then every commentator has been wrong up until a few decades ago, and that raises serious questions how not one but countless writers could be so confused
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I aim to have proper theology or least know the boundaries of what can exist within proper theology. 

Scripture says that God says that men shall not have sex with other men. Jesus didn't die on the cross to abolish that law, and Paul makes it crystal clear that nothing changed.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton What is proper theology to an agnostic? That was a rhetorical question.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Unless you have any other questions, comments, or concerns, I think that pretty much wraps it up. You're agnostic and I know where you stand. You should know where I stand. It has been a pleasure conversing.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton And these things aren't up for review by sinful man every generation or so. God is at the head of proper theology, not sinful man, and where He has spoken the issue is closed.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Excellent. The main point, however, is that we are commanded first and foremost to love God and that entails keeping His commandments. If He says don't give your love to idols or money or prideful self-love or unlawful sex, then it is in keeping with the greatest commandment.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Jesus was asked about it and he just changed the subject to talk about the resurrection of the dead. Having said that, there is a Christological aspect to the law (i.e., a shadow of the Christ) seen in the story of Ruth and it's importance in the genealogy of Christ.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I honestly would have to give that some thought. My knee jerk reaction is that it was tied to the clan system of land ownership in Israel. The fact that the NT doesn't seem to bring it up seems to support the argument for abrogation, but I honestly haven't given it much thought.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "Love" in English encompasses four Greek words: Agape, phileo, storge, and eros. Agape is the deep love the scripture deals with most. Confusing the other forms with agape leads to confusion.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Are you asking about whether Christians are still required to marry their brother's widow or would that be properly filed under the Jewish exceptionalism that has been done away with?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton The early Church most certainly did see all love that does not come from and conform with God as illegitimate. It would be absurd to argue otherwise.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton This is twitter. It would help if you were more specific so I don't waste your time answering something you're not asking.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Special revelation from the Triune God as an intrusion into history affirmed over and over again.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Yes. I am on the Jesus, Saint Paul, Saint Peter, Saint James, Author of the Letter to the Hebrews bandwagon.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Pagans love their idols. God doesn't view that love to be legit. Some people love money. God doesn't view that love legit. Some people will murder and steal for love. God doesn't view that as legit. Let's not turn love into another empty word.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It's not from my own imagination saying "I like this, but not that." It comes from scripture. Dietary laws were declared over. The sacrificial system was declared over. Jewish exceptionalism was declared over.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton cf. Second commandment
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton There is a simple interpretive method. I can't flesh it out in a tweet, but if you seriously have questions why somethings are practiced and others aren't, I'd be happy to give an answer.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Idolatry comes to mind. The pagans really loved their statues. God calls them disgusting.
@JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Says the accuser who has nothing to show :)
@JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I don't form my life around Tumblr jargon
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton LOL 40 years? Try thousands of years! I'm just walking through Leviticus 18. It's all there together. Consenting love can still be perverse and God calls it such and calls His people to not take it lightly. Do you understand the theology here?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It's not always abusive right? What if mum and son are super into it. Why shouldn't love win? What's the big deal? God said something about it but that was so long ago, and we are more enlightened now, so what's with these laws?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton And the LORD says: "And you shall not lie with any animal and so make yourself unclean with it, neither shall any woman give herself to an animal to lie with it: it is perversion." Is this still relevant today? What if science finds out that the animals like it?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Adam didn't have the law. We're talking about the revelation of God's law in history regarding incest. What's the big deal? Love knows no bounds right?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I don't make Australian laws. Let's get back to the text. What's wrong with incest? Does God want His people to refrain from incest? Is this up for a vote? Does it matter if it becomes popular in the pagan culture?
@absalomedia @omeagoz @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, which is the nakedness of your mother; she is your mother, you shall not uncover her nakedness." But hey, what if it is not abusive, loving, and kind and cute? Obviously God isn't talking about that, right?

Is this how we do?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I mean things change, right? Moses had no idea that such a loving relationship could exist, but we know better today that it is theoretically possible that this could become obsolete. The Lord spoke to them, not us, right?

Is this how we do scripture?
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Okay. Let's see how I got it wrong as you imply. "None of you shall approach any one of his close relatives to uncover nakedness. I am the Lord." Does this depend on if a mum and son really love each other and want to raise a family in loving, monogamous, non-abusive safe space?
@absalomedia @omeagoz @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton In the Jewish context, injustice is the same as unrighteousness and unholiness. In other words, nothing can be an injustice that is not unrighteous and unholy. That means it's not up to the subjective feelings of sinful man to define justice or holiness by his own feelings.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm talking about rebellion within the parameters of a Supreme Being who has entered into history and has spoken. If you reject that premise, nothing I am saying should make sense, because then it all becomes subjective and up to a vote by sinful man.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton You act as if "science" is some neutral ground where everyone agrees on this issue and we should just take our theological orders from what? The best selling authors? A poll of leading scientists? Should we update our confession every 10 years after a survey? God has spoken.
@absalomedia @omeagoz @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton There is no falseness to mention other than doing what God makes crystal clear is unnatural and abominable. I know this is strong language. I didn't invent it. It's not some cover for my hatred. I have to ask myself: Do I think God spoke on this issue? The answer is yes.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton We're talking about jurisdiction. They can rebel all they want. There are consequences.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton “Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you." The consequences to this rebellion aren't always apparent, but look the shortness of life, the suicide, the addiction. Scripture says these are divine judgements
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I understand this is the pagan worldview. It is not mine. We see the fruit of the pagan approach to parenting and it so chaotic with everyone saying "not my job"
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton First off, I'm not an evangelical. I am confessionally reformed. Second off, it's a parents responsibility to raise children. This isn't some egalitarian democracy between a 34 year old and a 4 year old.
@absalomedia @omeagoz @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It's about the linguistic domain and the context of the use. "Arsen” means man. “koite” means bed. Ergo, it means men who bed with other men. This is how the Septuagint translated the Hebrew in Lev 20:13. It's not that mysterious.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Like I said, the term abuse has lost its currency. I want to make clear: I am not some redneck fundamentalist. I've read a lot of Foucault &amp;co. on this subject, and the entire dynamic of the relationships now as it was back then has a power dynamic. However, not simple 100% abuse
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton See now this is basic 5th Commandment stuff. The child is under the care of the mother and father, but the child rejects that authority. The child proceeds to reject the authority of scripture and the authority of God. This is the most cascading form of rebellion.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I would certainly hope you didn't think he was inerrant. I don't even consider it that original. It's a lot of Brownson. In both cases, the name of the game is sophistry mixed with a lot of complex human emotions which obscure the game itself. This is very touchy territory.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton The meaning is derived from context. Paul wouldn't have thrown an innocent rape victim out of the Kingdom of God. His use demands cooperation on both parties involved (active/passive). There's no way around. Matthew Vines et al can try but it's bordering on the absurd
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton 1 Cor 6:9 uses two terms malakoi (meaning the passive homosexual partner) and arsenokoitai (meaning the active homosexual). It's graphic enough to leave no room for confusion
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Get an ESV. It's a great translation. https://t.co/F3iNu7xTIF
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I completely reject that misreading of the text. We have commentaries that go back thousands of years in multiple languages and they all say the same thing. With all due respect, people are trying to be slick with revisionism, but it is incredibly obvious what the intention is.
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton With all due respect, if I were super sensitive and emotional I could mischaracterize the above tweet as "abuse" against me. It's a very loose, subjective term these days.
@TummyJimmy @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @vanbadham @LyleShelton Suppress the truth in unrighteousness. Tah tah!
@TummyJimmy @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @vanbadham @LyleShelton Get a Bible and read it. No spoiler alert.

@JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @GeorgeSaadi @vanbadham @LyleShelton "Love thy neighbor" is a summery of the law given to Moses, which included executing sodomites
@TummyJimmy @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @vanbadham @LyleShelton I give all glory to God!
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Okay, we stone them and they die. We don't stone them and they kill themselves. We leave them alone and they die from alarming rates at early ages from drug overdose and STDs. I wonder what's up with that.
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton People get real sad faced when they get called out for abomination :(
@TummyJimmy @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @vanbadham @LyleShelton "He who's without sin..." isn't in the Bible anymore. It was added centuries later
@TummyJimmy @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @vanbadham @LyleShelton I have a beautiful beard!
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton That's horrific
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I don't think you get how serious sin is to God. Nor do I think you understand how slippery man attempts to be when he is in active rebellion.
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton What church do they go to?
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm sorry but it's not about rape. Did you read "lie with a man as a woman"? If you do it, then you die. This is basic literacy stuff here man.
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton LOL everyone agreed with me until a hot minute ago when the heretics started coming out of the woodwork. There's no basis
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Yeah, they were ravenously looking for fresh meat to rape from visiting strangers. That is pretty bad, but being a poor host was the cherry on the top of their offenses
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton LOL that's playing make believe. Our society loves sin and lawlessness so much and hates righteousness and justice so much that it would be silly to even talk about that.
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Jude, i.e., Jesus' brother who grew up with Jesus says: "just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire."
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton With all due respect, you don't understand our theology. Jesus gave the Law that called that behavior a capital offense. He was there when Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed. He was the one who destroyed them!
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Do murderers hang themselves in prison because of society being so mean to them? Are we supposed to feel bad?
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Jesus made all foods clean!
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Harm society? That lifestyle is death to begin with. Why are you surprised by the statistics?
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm not one of those cherry picking Christians. It says what it says and there is no way around it.
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Nah, it's the other way around. Promoting decadence has a tendency to create societal decay.
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "I am the Lord. You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. And you shall not lie with any animal and so make yourself unclean with it, neither shall any woman give herself to an animal to lie with it: it is perversion." (Lev 18)
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. (1 Cor 6)
@alrightPET @tonyschwartz Absolutely!
@alrightPET @tonyschwartz Romans is a heavy letter and there's a lot of challenging theology that isn't exactly "feel good" for most people, and to be honest, I think most evangelicals approach the text as a source for proof texting rather than work through the text point by point.
@alrightPET @tonyschwartz Very, very true!
@poptart9797 @starshine5903 @only_half_demon @SoCalledPrez1 @MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley @LindseyGrahamSC God's Law forbids to convicting someone based on the story of one witness, and claims of rape are deemed instantly illegit if they happen in a public place with people in hearing distance and the woman doesn't have a real good excuse for not screaming.
@Can_Skeptic_Wm It was a compliment for the high density of cliches somehow shoved within the limited space set by Twitter :)
@Can_Skeptic_Wm @CoertVisser @tonyschwartz Did you run out of characters or cliches?
@alrightPET @tonyschwartz God used the wicked Babylonians to punish the Israelites, and then turned around and punished the Babylonians after they served their purpose. Theologically speaking, bad people with bad intentions can often lead to good. People will get what they deserve in the end
@sumbodysbabygrl @tonyschwartz "If there is a betrothed virgin, and a man meets her in the city and lies with her, then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry for help though she was in the city" (Deut 22)
@tonyschwartz “A single witness shall not suffice  against a person for any crime or  for any wrong in connection with any  offense that he has committed.  Only on the evidence of two witnesses or of three witnesses shall a  charge be established." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
@TummyJimmy @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @vanbadham @LyleShelton "Judge not!" is the most misquoted verses in scripture. We are commanded to judge righteously rather than hypocritically. 'I charged your judges at that time, ‘Hear the cases between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the alien who is with him.'
@LJCharlette @MrsRabbitResist @steve37341 The Law requires the Death Penalty. What did Jesus say about the Law? “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them." (Matt 5)
@tango793_anne @JennyBStEsprit @JamesMartinSJ Jesus said loving God to the max and loving your neighbor as yourself is a summary of the whole Law of God, which doesn't include dragging sodomites before a judge to sentence them to a chocolate cake party.
@KellyThomasSand @MrsRabbitResist If you think it's a bunch of mythology, how would you know that he even said "love thy neighbor"?
@ericrescue @Bronco_7777 @wdunlap @TomiLahren That's like saying Jesus was a raging North Carolinian. (North Carolina as an entity didn't exist 2000 years ago)
