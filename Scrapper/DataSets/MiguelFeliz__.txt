@Flyguymel__ @chrissavess @canbewhoischris No lie, the more I think about it I feel like Footlocker monopolized the whole thing since they make money if you cop it from them or GOAT
@Flyguymel__ @canbewhoischris So basically you mean you would want Footlocker to open up a GOAT pop up like StockX did on Broadway
@canbewhoischris @Flyguymel__ It honestly can go either way, let’s see how this plays out
@Flyguymel__ Then again the money they lost in reselling the technically might “make it back” since they have invested in GOAT
@Flyguymel__ Man I honestly have no clue as of right now. You know it’s good to diversify your business ventures so if a big corporation is backing these resellers maybe they have more of an incentive to sell these shoes? Idk
Footlocker: We’re investing 100 Million Dollars into GOAT

The high cut is what really does it for me too. I never really liked the previous retro of the 11 that have had  lower cuts because I thought they would look funny on me. When I tried on the Concord with the high cut. I instantly fell in love and can’t wait to rock mine. (2/2)
Really excited and eager to see and listen to what people have to say about the Bred’s coming back. Personally, I like them but not as much as the Concord. It’s not as versatile in my opinion but it’s still an iconic shoe that’s a must have for me. (1/2)

Believe it or not, I was kind of excited when I found out that Hoodie was going to the Cavs. I thought he was going to be a good three and D shooting guard who would be able to create a bit alongside LeBron. I think he can still get there though no doubt https://t.co/OxAU6OVaka

The best part about superheroes (besides their backstory, power set, etc) is that you don’t have to be a super skilled fighter or blessed with extraordinary abilities to do good. You just have to have a will to want to help everyone which is just so beautiful and inspiring to me
I really love superheroes, like I REALLY really love them. I just love the fact that they can make a positive impact on the world and influence others to act accordingly.
