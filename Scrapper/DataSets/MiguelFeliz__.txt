@Flyguymel__ @chrissavess @canbewhoischris No lie, the more I think about it I feel like Footlocker monopolized the whole thing since they make money if you cop it from them or GOAT
@Flyguymel__ @canbewhoischris So basically you mean you would want Footlocker to open up a GOAT pop up like StockX did on Broadway
@canbewhoischris @Flyguymel__ It honestly can go either way, let‚Äôs see how this plays out
@Flyguymel__ Then again the money they lost in reselling the technically might ‚Äúmake it back‚Äù since they have invested in GOAT
@Flyguymel__ Man I honestly have no clue as of right now. You know it‚Äôs good to diversify your business ventures so if a big corporation is backing these resellers maybe they have more of an incentive to sell these shoes? Idk
Footlocker: We‚Äôre investing 100 Million Dollars into GOAT
