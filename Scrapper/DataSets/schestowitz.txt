#wikileaks lets people search the site without relying on #google or even its spiders. There's a small news section in that site, but it's unloved and neglected. I think it's a cautionary tale about relying on third parties (more so those connected to the US government).
I'd continues to argue that #wikileaks developed a little too much dependence (for its own good) on third parties like #corporatemedia publishers and #socialcontrolmedia like #twitter and it's harming the site. #assange wrote for #ciapost

'Phones' nowadays have more cameras than their so-called 'owner' has eyes. All those sensors corporations could not convince people to attach to themselves (DNA, biometrics, RFID, always-on microphone) are now semi-attached through 'cool' phones.
When you carry around a so-called 'phone' you become yet more of a product (of many companies) because you vomit a lot of personal data to these companies every 60 seconds or so. #surveillance #tracking #listeningdevices #surveillancecapitalism
In #surveillancecapitalism the product is the person (data)
The objective is to empty this product's wallet
The clients are those whose pockets get filled at the expense of the product's wallet

Direct exchange of goods and services bypass the need for money, but in many cases it is impractical because you cannot always exchange your knowledge or work with the person who at a given point in time is "indebted" to you. Works better inside family.
Money derives its value/worth from the perception if not widespread consensus that it can be exchanged for real things that aren't just bits or bits of paper. Money is not a science but a pseudoscience some call economics.

Try to do OK in life not by making a lot of money but by spending a lot less money and lowering expectations in general. We're going to need the latter mentality to survive. Empathy and greed aren't compatible in this capitalism.
Maybe I'm wrong about the planet going in a bad direction. Eventually we'll learn to "love" walls, shame the poor, eat "likes" and associate our personal worth with a device called "phone" but is actually just #RFID we spend our whole budget on. Yay future!!
