@Christianaulic @LeagueTribune @KingJames @NFL Not to mention they allowed Donald Sterling (who was a well known racist) to remain an owner, knowing that he was a racist. They didn’t do nothing until he was caught on tape being a racist. They don’t care about people of color, they care about their bottom line.
@Christianaulic @LeagueTribune @KingJames @NFL With the NBA being more of a “players” league, they get to have gullible fans thinking they’re “progressive” when in all actuality they’re just as racist. It was the NBA that blackballed players first for protesting the anthem and they doubled down on their anthem policy.

@MzCandice_B On God I was just talking to a coworker about putting my sons in jiu jitsu. They’re physical and like to wrestle and shit so I think that might be the better fit for them. But I’m going to make sure they’re in some form of combat sport and extra curricular activity.

@aztectm @SportsandOtherJ @hberrybenitez @HPbasketball AD is under contract until the end of the 2021 season.

@LWOSRishiOza @JokicTheSunGod @KATsBurner @TheHoopCentral I wouldn’t say Jokic can play PG. There’s more to that position than assist. Jokic is a great passer though. KAT is more versatile defensively because he can stay in front of most wings and guards. You’re splitting hairs with the both them.
@TammieSupremee 🤣😂🤣
@TammieSupremee And I hope Drake loses his voice 🙃
@JokicTheSunGod @KATsBurner @LWOSRishiOza @TheHoopCentral And I think Towns is better because he’s more effective on both ends and more versatile. No slight to either

@Czar_Robby @BR_NBA Which is a career high for him and low for a PG. That’s what I’m talking about.

@losfraud @TheHoopCentral That’s the problem....he continues to ball out like he did in his MVP season the media doesn’t care because he makes getting triple doubles look easy.

@Abyousocrazy Exactly. A lot of parents (especially black parents) try to provide the best they can but they miss the mark in preparing their children for the real world. That adds to the disadvantages that already exist for black teens/children
@_ilovekitty Lmao same here with my pops. That shit didn’t do nothing but stress me out make me resent him.
@Bretiful I think even back then it was a set up for failure too. My grandfather was a skilled carpenter but because he had a 5th grade education and zero to no guidance, his businesses could never take off like he wanted. But you’re right, in today’s economy it’s a recipe for disaster
@Abyousocrazy Very sad and ignorant to be quite honest. How can you expect a child to make it in this world on their own with no support? That’s one major issue with black parenting that doesn’t get talked about enough.
It’s some folks who parents kicked them out in high school or even younger and let them figure shit out on their own. Personally, I could never see myself throwing my child to the wolves and expecting them to succeed. That’s unrealistic.
@crym89s My sentiments exactly bro
@crym89s Right. Lol I think we all have been blessed to some degree by our own parents but as adults recognize that there were some things our parents missed. Hell some folks don’t even know their biological parents.

I envy those of you who grew up with parents that taught you about credit, investments, etc. Some people weren’t prepared for adulthood
