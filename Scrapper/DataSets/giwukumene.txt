#Zimbabwe need statesman who honor their campaign promises and are willing to solve the impasse and move the economy forward. Austerity for prosperity is not the way to go and if it the way let us all feel the pain not austerity for only the taxpayers. @zenzele
#ZimbabweShutDown  people power should be respect and you once said " the voice of the people is the voice of God" now that people have spoken for the past two days that they want employment, 1:1 bond not fallacy be repealed, good policies and above all legitimate government.
