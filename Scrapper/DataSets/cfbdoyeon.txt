@cfbjunkyu marketing 101
bluetooth earphones are longer and at least have grip. you can see it quickly too. imagine the airpod is shorter than my will to be alive and that is already telling something how short it actually is
imagine there is a person in apple inc that thought "tired of detangling your earphones? now get tired of losing them!" and everyone just agreed to it
windows phone aint worth it too. they have very slim choices of apps.
