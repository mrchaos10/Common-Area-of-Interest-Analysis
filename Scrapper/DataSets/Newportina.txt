And my ass just filed a formal complaint with the district manager. He wouldn’t even give me a receipt so I had his name. I have never been so angry in my life. For a white man to do that to a black woman in a bank on the UWS FULL of white people. I felt lesser than. Do better
He snickered at me the entire time as people behind me were getting impatient (it was a very long line). It was in fact accurately counted but he didn’t trust me. There are scales to make sure, you are a teller to make sure. To embarrass me like that is so unprofessional.
I decided to cash in all of Dashiell’s change for him at the bank today. They were accurately counted by me and yet for some reason the teller makes me take out all the change from the rolls and count them in front of a room full of white people. Their job is to do that

I’m so grateful that I get to wake up next to him every morning and fall asleep with him every night. He is heaven sent and I’m just very glad. Very very glad.
And again, he’s never dealt with someone who was bipolar yet he navigated so expertly. He actually takes the time to research the disorder and understand it and that is so fucking important. That is what you do for someone you love.
I said it once and I’ll say it again: I am so fucking glad I fell in love with someone who can be there for me when I have a mental breakdown. Last night was really really rough for me and all he did was listen until I was finished and then gave me action steps to get better

@ObeyTheNips Lol well I genuinely appreciate you looking out for me
@ObeyTheNips Ay it does but they only go up to DDD :(. I’m the next size up which is a G. Idk man I’ll ask some of my friends if they know any boutiques. Thank you for searching for me 😘😘😘
@ObeyTheNips Cute clothes but their bras would MAYBE fit D cups and I’m a lot bigger than that. I really appreciate it a lot! They have some nice outfits, might shop around a lil. Thanks!!
@ObeyTheNips I don’t care about brand whatsoever. I just need it to fit properly and have some nice look to it as well as not be too expensive.
@ObeyTheNips Not really. Every website is either crazy expensive (literally some places minimum price for a bra was like $400) or they’re grandma bras :(

Like literally what are you doing every other god damn day? You talk about how you attended but WHAT ELSE ARE YOU DOING??? Like how are you actually helping people? You just go so you can act better than everyone else in the office you old white bitch I can't stand you.
I'm sorry that I actually have to think about things like, idk maybe MY PEOPLE?? About how intersectionality is important &amp; how I don't feel like being surrounded by "oh my PUSSY means POWER!!! Woohoo VAGINAS!!" and fucking people who are really only there for the hashtag &amp; pics
LMAO I am so tired, SOOO fucking tired of these white fucking people trying to DEBATE me while I'm literally WORKING to talk about how my ideals aren't right because I didn't want to attend the women's march. I'm SOOO sorry that I disagree about your white feminist ideals
But speaking of, a black woman just walked in to interview so that might be good. There are literally 2 poc, not even just black but poc in GENERAL, in my office. I want you to realize I work for a jazz foundation. J A Z Z bro. And there are only 2 poc. I can’t
