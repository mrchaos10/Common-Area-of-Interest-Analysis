wmvanvliet eglerean CyrilRPernet eknahm emdupre_ brainhackorg dat_project datalad LindaDouw Does this loop back to the beginning of the conversation about needing a centralised infrastructure If people aren t downloading data to their local machines 
 
Not criticising Just noting how difficult this problem is to balance the different ethical challenges 
eglerean wmvanvliet CyrilRPernet eknahm emdupre_ brainhackorg dat_project datalad LindaDouw I think we agree that it would be really hard but I don t think it would be unsustainable It would mean a very different style of communication with the data owners participants though It would mean keeping them much better informed about opportunities than we currently do 
madprime kirstie_j eknahm eglerean CyrilRPernet emdupre_ brainhackorg dat_project datalad OpenHumansOrg thanks kirstie_j 
CyrilRPernet eglerean eknahm emdupre_ brainhackorg dat_project datalad mydataorg Each participant owns their data 
wmvanvliet eglerean CyrilRPernet eknahm emdupre_ brainhackorg dat_project datalad LindaDouw I agree with you except that I d prefer to phrase it as the participants having control rather than the researcher Which is very close to the spirit of what you say but would be implemented very differently 
eglerean eknahm CyrilRPernet emdupre_ brainhackorg dat_project datalad mydataorg Its radical to actually put the data back in the hands of the participant but potentially very very cool And I think it absolves the university from their responsibilities quite nicely 
eglerean eknahm CyrilRPernet emdupre_ brainhackorg dat_project datalad mydataorg I don t think universities want to own data I just think they ve dug themselves into a paternalistic hole and can t find an easy way out I don t personally think open is the way to go but this type of managed access BY THE DATA OWNER might be really awesome 
eknahm eglerean CyrilRPernet emdupre_ brainhackorg dat_project datalad Do you know about OpenHumansOrg It s doing some really awesome work allowing people to upload their personal data and then release that for use by a bunch of research projects You could hypothetically say anyone can use it or you can have finer grained control

eknahm emdupre_ CyrilRPernet eglerean brainhackorg Yes I m watching the decentralised projects dat_project in particular to see how they come up with governance solutions The peer to peer part is super tough if there s sensitive personal data but maybe not impossible and really really fantastic for maintaining datasets 
eknahm emdupre_ CyrilRPernet eglerean brainhackorg Propose a better one And then maintain that one And then convince the small c conservative university legal teams that this new system is better 
 
These aren t technical problems they re social And they re heavily reliant on better sustainability of alternative tools

miriamkp Just because your prof is a lady and nice and good at explaining things in simple terms does not mean she is technically inco 
eknahm emdupre_ CyrilRPernet eglerean brainhackorg The other point is managed access for more sensitive data I think there s quite a high risk of triangulation if questionnaire survey data is shared with brain imaging data So who is funding the infrastructure for managed access to accompany the open if possible imaging data 
eknahm emdupre_ CyrilRPernet Yes And I think standard text responses are a really valuable resource It s exhausting trying to convince committees legal teams to change their behaviour having tried amp tested techniques are really really helpful HT eglerean in the brainhackorg slack

story Yes I think this is really true It s a better thought out piece of work if done at the start Even if there aren t many big ethical considerations 
daniellecrobins mozilla KadijaFerryman lesliekwchan tararobertson CarolMN dr_lrwyatt nshockey crystalleecrain Now I know you a 
DrAndrewV So it is facetious the way we re phrasing it now BUT it s also exactly true The reputational damage of researchers publishing work that is then slammed in the press is a huge factor Not my personal motivation but how we ve got buy in at the Turing 
DrAndrewV Hehe this is exactly the argument that didn t work They replied YOU 
 
sigh I agree with you completely though 
ethanwhite One of the biggest challenges for me is recognizing when I m struggling and need to do something about it I regularly lo 
ethanwhite One of the points of this thread is that this happens to everyone and it happens frequently It doesn t say anything bad ab 
ethanwhite I m feeling burnt out and struggling to motivate today so I thought talk through how I am trying and have tried in the pa 
itjohnstone Yes I ve sometimes phrased this as people before us have done bad stuff so now we can t have nice things We have to build the trust back up even if an individual researcher has never done anything wrong 
itjohnstone I m not trying to be sanctimonious by the way I m trying to acknowledge that everyone is motivated for different reasons Which is why a battery of them is super helpful No point in trying to get everyone to think like me 
itjohnstone I completely agree with this And it isn t my personal motivation I subscribe to do no harm and I personally care about the impact of the work but this is a strong point that I ve used with others as a selfish long term reason to do ethical research 
Specific request from this researcher is that the ethics committee think about the ethical considerations 
 
I think this can t be as effective as getting the researchers to think about the consequences of their actions but that approach hasn t worked AutomatingTheCrowd 
On topic for AutomatingTheCrowd and RealPeopleBehindAI I m crowd sourcing an answer to the question Why should I a data scientist have to care about the ethical considerations of my work

samhforbes What I mean by not using issues is the use of them as a project management tool or a place to have discussions and get feedback Most folks think of them only for bugs 
 
I think you re missing some functionality if you only use issues for bugs but that s a lab decision 
samhforbes My other big recommendation is to remember that git and GitHub are very different skill sets I know lots of people who are git wizards but don t know how to do a pull request and don t use issues So train for both skills 
samhforbes The number of notifications is really tough So keep having lots of conversations about how to best communicate There are GitHub options to manage notifications but they require some common ways of working knowing when to tag etc that only humans can determine 
samhforbes My philosophy is to focus on the in lab training and build up confidence so they can make later projects open if they d like

She points out the centuries of compound interest that white British people have benefited from In fact the amount paid to slave OWNERS not the people actually harmed was so great it was only paid off in t co TiJqzovek 
The first chapter is about the history of black people in Britain It s quite different to the history in the USA for a few different reasons One that struck me was that the British participants in the slave trade benefitted from it but didn t actually see its violence 
She also acknowledges how ironic the title is she s mostly talked to white people about race ever since her blog post in And of course this book is helping white people like me better understand structural racism 
In the preface she explains the title and says I don t see giving up as a sign of weakness but as an act of self preservation I m remember quoting so that might be the gist if not exact

handee pennyb STEMGamechange scientistshuman pocsquared Thisismeonline I love the scientistshuman project SO FREAKING MUCH 
 
Loved this post Thisismeonline Thank you so much for sharing STEMGamechangers 
handee ICYMI STEMGamechange alumna amp scientistshuman pocsquared founder Thisismeonline wrote a great article on what it s like to 
The speakers at AutomatingTheCrowd will cover four broad themes 
 
Locating the real Mechanical Turk 
 
Collaboration or competition 
 
Community factors and motivation 
 
Digital literacy and fair inclusion 
 
We can cover them at RealPeopleBehindAI too or add new topics 
This is a public event that will follow a workshop on AutomatingTheCrowd during the day t co JjKA mJs G 
 
You had to apply to attend the workshop and it was not easy to select only people to join us 
 
Everyone there is going to be SO INTERESTING to speak with

DimitraBlana choldgraf mybinderteam rachaelevelyn turinginst Another aspect of our project is to run a research software engineering focused workshop to try to build up capacity for folks in universities in the UK to host binder hubs themselves THEN you can work with sensitive data more easily 
DimitraBlana choldgraf mybinderteam rachaelevelyn turinginst Yay Loved that talk at Turing 
 
The point about setting up environments being hard is A HUGE motivation for me to promote binder 
 
How sensitive is the data you work with That s a challenge with the public binderhub not if you can host your own

DimitraBlana choldgraf mybinderteam SO COOL We should have the eventbrite up in a couple of weeks One in Manchester and one in London 
 
When you were discussing binder what was it that made you want to use it I have my ideas I m just curious as to what folks said in lab meeting 
This is supposed to say friendly PSA But hey we can be friends if you d like 
OHBM_Trainees We ve been hard at work on a new community based project on self management advice for early career researchers Please 
NeilLewisJr AlxEtz My feeling is that most folks in academia weigh teaching higher than invited talks and service so if you can make a good case that it was truly a pedagogical exercise not just a demo or a research presentation I d go for teaching 
NeilLewisJr AlxEtz And adding having read another reply if you don t give many talks then invited talks 
NeilLewisJr AlxEtz I think it depends on a who is reading your CV what the job requires and b where you have the least content If you don t have much teaching experience then put it there if you don t have much service then there

Would you mind please replying to the discourse post I think that makes sense as the best place to coordinate at least at this early stage

choldgraf emdupre_ So NOPE or similar error message is very easy to do but it might be more fun to see how code still RUNS but gives you different answers 
choldgraf emdupre_ Hehe the goal is to build a tutorial where we tell people to change the package version in the requirements file and then see the different answers in their binder notebook

_DarrenPrice Definitely not neuroimaging specific it s in the context of all of data science I was thinking super simple like a number that s rounded differently or the length of a string with emojis treated differently 
Heya I m looking for really small examples of getting different results when using different package versions I know the big problems come when a bunch of packages interact weirdly together but I m writing a tutorial and would love just a little example Python or R ideally

CaAl mariabloec dingding_peng ShuhBillSkee Slides are all CC BY though so you can change it to anything you d like 
CaAl mariabloec dingding_peng ShuhBillSkee But most analyses that I do are much more complicated than a t test and that s where these little differences that are never detailed in the methods sections come in 
CaAl mariabloec dingding_peng ShuhBillSkee There s a nuance there though that code that says it s doing the same thing may not actually do exactly the same thing under the hood T tests are a good example different assumptions of equality of variance will give different results w diff packages

rachaelevelyn Great thread on how to apply for a job in STEM specifically how to tailor your CV and cover letter t co wLyY 
Last entry I think in the thread of threads my advice for formatting your CV and writing a really fantastic cover letter 
 
 
Thank you to everyone who has shared the job ad and these various twitter threads 
 
One last big share before the deadline on THURSDAY JAN 
 
I m SO EXCITED to read your applications t co BIByXI VsT 
As I ve said over and over in all my various tweet threads over the last few weeks 
 
I BELIEVE IN YOU 
 
Specific technical experience is not as important as your ability to learn new skills and to communicate across diverse communities 
 
 
Show me that you ve thought about it Show me that you share our values or how you d prefer to enhance them 
 
Tell me who you are and what you d like to do 
 
Make it easy for me to check the box that says YOU are the best fit for the role 
Let s try to wrap up 
 
DO link your CV and cover letter to the requirements and the responsibilities of the role 
 
DO NOT go through the items on the job ad one by one in order 
 
CURATE your application 
I ve just realised how ironic it is that I m writing a massive tweet thread about being brief Whoooops t co tZJ GSggfq 
You don t have much space 
 
You can t tell me your whole life story 
 
Use the cover letter to focus my attention on aspects of your CV but don t repeat them 
As with I m a clear communicator saying I m a good collaborator doesn t carry much weight 
 
TELL ME of your collaborative successes Model best practice by celebrating others in your teams Make me excited to work with you 
What are you excited about Why would this position be a useful stepping stone on your career path Why are you a great fit for the goals 
 
What do you bring that the team doesn t have What will I learn from you 
An essential requirement is that you have an understanding of Autism Neurodiversity and the barriers faced by members of traditionally underrepresented groups 
 
This is difficult to show on your CV But there are SO MANY WAYS you can tell your story in your cover letter t co wI QyAo L 
This is the place to communicate that you UNDERSTAND THE JOB 
 
Read the values document 
 
Think about why this position aligns with your career goals 
 
TELL ME THAT STORY 
 
 
On the other hand if your cover letter is more than pages I m going to be suspicious 
 
With effort amp a lot of thought you CAN write a shorter letter 
 
I don t think with all the requirements in this job ad that you can submit page KUDOS if you can though but is enough 
I don t mind how long your CV is Academic CVS can be pages and pages This is NOT the case in most areas 
 
But it has to be easy to scan 
 
Bullet points and links are lovely 
And now let me transition to the cover letter by reiterating that formatting in your CV is SO SO SO important 
 
It takes too much cognitive load to trawl through big paragraphs of text 
 
LESS IS MORE 
Imagine I have to go and justify why I want you to a big senior person This isn t the case but imagine 
 
Which lines in the document am I going to point to 
My biggest piece of advice is HELP ME HELP YOU 
 
I WANT to hire you 
 
Advocate for yourself in the CV 
 
Go through the job description and make sure that every piece of experience that provides evidence for why you can do this job is IN THE DOCUMENT t co LmT C cNAP 
Your CV and cover letters themselves will tell me if you can communicate clearly 
 
The same goes for being able to code Give me links to your GitHub GitLab repositories Tell me what you ve built Even if it s just for fun make sure it s on the CV t co FyTEVG rtZ 
If you try to say you have a great ability to communicate clearly and effectively in your cover letter you re just wasting words 
 
SHOW ME that you can do this Given talks Got any teaching training experience Written blogs Made YouTube videos Links please t co DK edfxJXm 
Make sure that the most relevant pieces of experience are on your CV Don t follow a standard template without thinking about it 
 
This job ad has a HUGE list of requirements You do not have space to address all of them in your cover letter So make sure they re in your CV 
The reason I ask for a CV is because I want to see where you ve been 
 
Your cover letter is going to tell me where you want to go and maybe draw some attention to highlights of your past but the CV tells me what you ve done so far 
Let s start with the CV 
 
No one is going to read this in depth until the interview 
 
FORMATTING is key 
 
Make sure that it is incredibly easy to scan your CV and pull out key achievements 
Here s a screenshot of the application procedure from the job ad It asks for a CV contact details of your referees and a covering letter 
 
Not much right 
 
I think this makes the application pretty freaking hard Let me explain why t co ZXZQrFgGT 
Let s start by saying these are only my opinions I ll justify them so I hope they make sense to you But different selection committees will have different requirements Don t over generalise to different positions 
Last twitter thread for this job with me AutisticaUK amp turinginst Because the deadline is THURSDAY JAN Just two days to get your application in 
 
I m going to give you my opinions on how to write a good cover letter I hope they re helpful

jtth AutisticaUK turinginst Definitely sub optimal I m not trying to argue against you There are many MANY problems with how much we get paid in academia and for what types of reward I personally think that by making the outputs totally OpenSource we can at least make the next position easier to get 
jtth AutisticaUK turinginst The salary is tough It s good for an academic postdoc but clearly nowhere close to an industry position The year fixed term is the same There s nothing I can do to improve that at this point Which is why the FullStack experience can be developed on the job 
jtth AutisticaUK turinginst It wouldn t be impossible but a lot of the first year of work would involve design work with members of AutisticaUK s Discover cohort and as both the Turing and Autistica s offices are in London I suspect that the position will require quite a bit of in person work

chrisXrodgers I m also a big fan of managed access for human data for mostly ethical and partially reporting reasons but that s kinda a different topic 
chrisXrodgers In sum CC is most correct but I think CC BY is a very very good stepping stone if you are feeling more anxious about getting some credit for your hard curated amp collected data 
 
Also strong endorsement for Things are going to be confusing for a while 
chrisXrodgers Having said that there s nothing I disagree with in the blog post They make a totally logical argument about the legal position and that cheaters gonna cheat I don t feel the same confidence that scholarly norms will lead to citations but I d love to be wrong 
chrisXrodgers So most OpenData advocates recommend CC because the data doesn t BELONG to the curator and it maximises reuse as said in the blog 
 
I personally like CC BY because I think people don t know HOW to credit data and I like the nudge to include some attribution

I m so excited about our values for this project They re all written out in a document attached to the job description but I ve also screen grabbed them for easy twitter reading in this thread t co SqNrDGCEpc 
The deadline for job applications is JANUARY 
 
Please let me know if you have any questions And please share widely 
 
Here s a thread of threads about the post that I ve written over the last couple of weeks t co tosB xtIF 
The postholder will have a lot to be working on And it s all participatory so the exact work will have to be designed and developed 
 
But the core values are fixed We stand together 
 
The exact wording can be adjusted if they re badly phrased please send any suggestions 
The same document has our outcomes 
 
Online CitizenScientist platform 
Curated FAIR dataset 
Two hopefully overlapping Communities CitizenScientists and Developers 
A few suggested publications to share what we ve learned 
 
 
A lot of these values are overlapping They all define ways of working to ensure an Open and Participatory community where everyone is welcome 
 
What I love about these is how when I re read them I can see so clearly the ways they will empower us to build and grow our team 
RESPECTFUL CONDUCT 
 
We will not tolerate bullying or harassment We will ensure that all community members have accessible pathways to report unacceptable conduct No member of the team is above the requirement to treat each other with respect and acceptance t co QLou bJ 
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION 
 
We are committed to equity for all All members of the project will be expected to recognise and identify barriers to inclusion and actively work to remove them We will build and maintain a community that is supportive of difference t co JSIhhJZw d 
OPEN SOURCE

PROTECTION AND CONSENT 
 
We will maintain the highest ethical standards of DataManagement and DataProtection We will build accessible and transparent consent models in collaboration with the Autistic CitizenScientists to ensure these are clear and meet their needs t co uLSEqYyOL 
TRANSPARENCY 
 
We ll explain our aims and motivations at the start and stay in contact with our community regarding future collaborations who has access to the data and WHY they re working with it And ensure contributors can revoke consent for these extensions as they prefer t co erYcm oeV

IMPACT 
 
Now I hate the term impact because its been ruined by the marketisation of academia via the REF But in this context impact means we are committed to doing work that positively impacts Autistic people s lives as quickly as possible t co Ee HDU qJM 
The values are only loosely ordered Don t read too much into which ones come first etc They re ALL important

DEADLINE JANUARY t co VsC sQps s 
 
Here s a little thread of threads so you can keep catching up on all the information I m sharing on here 
Super happy to answer any questions and I do think this is a big chunk of REALLY VALUABLE work Just think of the impact we can have on tech if we show that individuals being informed and empowered to manage their own data can be done t co dX ea BJf 
My personal gut feeling is that this will be a lot of thinking and stakeholder engagement work but I m quite confident that much of the technical components have already been developed I just don t think they ve all been incorporated into a project like this one before 
There are great teams who are already thinking about these sorts of data control models OpenHumansOrg in particular have already reached out about working with them to build a first version 
Regarding pandamakes question about how much work this is There are two answers 
 
It will take time The project is participatory so it will be designed and built with our Autistic collaborators We ll iterate with them on what needs to be built 
SO we need a fine grained consent model 
 
Every individual contributor needs to be able to have complete control over their data 
 
They aren t going to be signing up for some generic T amp Cs and losing sight of what s happening 
We ll also maintain the database to be FAIR under managed access Maybe other researchers would like to better understand Autism from the data Some Autistic contributors will want to take part in that work others may not 
BUT another goal is to build a database that can be used for research purposes Maybe we can run the stories through an NLP natural language processing algorithm to cluster them together Some CitizenScientist contributors will be ok with that Others would prefer not 
One of the goals of the project is to build community between Autistic people Ideally they ll feel a little less alone in these challenges share coping strategies amp support each other A CitizenScientist might be totally fine with sharing their stories for that purpose 
But you could imagine a different example that was outside someone s house where they re happy to upload the story for researchers to use to understand Autistic people s experiences but they don t want to it to be public 
You can imagine someone uploading an experience that is general enough that they re happy to make totally public Similar to a tweet I m on the jubilee line and there are far too many people its making me feel panicky for example 
In this CitizenScience project we ll be collecting experiences about the challenges that Autistic people have when navigate the environment 
 
For example is it very stressful to take the tube Yes Are there times that are particularly bad Yes What are the workarounds 
What do I mean by a fine grained consent model At the highest level it s pretty simple it means I want to give all the participants control over their data 
 
What does that mean in practise 
Great question from pandamakes about the AutisticaUK turinginst ResearchAssociate JOB that you should all be applying for and telling your friends about t co VsC sQps s

yoyehudi MozOpenLeaders That s one of my biggest frustrations about job ads They re often so generic they lack all meaning I think that s why we end up hiring to the status quo so much 
 
Poor HR turinginst kept trying to cut down what I d written it s so long amp I kept putting it all back in 
yoyehudi I had someone EXACTLY like you in my head when I was designing the role 
 
I m mega happy that you re starting a PhD that fits all your requirements 
 
As you can t apply I m so hopeful that someone else in MozOpenLeaders will be able to t co VsC sQps s 
And if you missed this thread before Christmas about why I am so excited to build this participatory CitizenScience project please check it out 
 
AND TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW about the job 
 
 
 
Stay tuned for a thread tomorrow about OpenSource and the Community we ll need in the project 
 
That s definitely the BIGGEST focus for me So much more so than the FullStack skills or previous academic job experience 
There s NO reason why you can t have those skills from outside academia 
 
Please do not let the PhD requirement stop you from applying 
 
The post is probably not suitable for someone just out of undergrad but never say never Who know s what path you ve taken to get there 
BUT You do not have to have a PhD to fulfil these requirements 
 
You will need evidence of independent leadership of a project or of a team of looking for solutions to problems sometimes of your own divising and of communicating what you ve learned and what you ve created 
Not all doctoral programmes provide that opportunity but many do And so the point of requiring a PhD for this job is that the post holder needs to be able to see or create a path to building that new knowledge and that s one of the key outcomes of a PhD in my opinion 
And I think the outcome of that is that you can generate NEW knowledge by the end 
 
I don t think this means significant results Nor expanding a theory Nor a new method 
 
I think it means contributing to making the world a better place by adding useful information 
I think a PhD should teach you to be an independent thinker I think you should have time and space to breathe and read and learn and digest the knowledge around you 
Every PhD is different and I got mine in the US Go Bears which is very different to the UK so the following opinions are mine only Everyone else s mileage will vary 
although maybe we SHOULD give academic credit for that work Let s call that another story for now 
I tweeted yesterday about the FullStack requirements of this job 
 
It seems pretty silly to require web development skills AND a PhD They aren t usually taught together 
 
 
Here s a little screen grab of the section in the essential requirements of the job description t co IJT loqEJ

So THANK YOU pennyb And thank you to all the ActuallyAutistic folks here on twitter who have helped me learn so much 
 
I really appreciate the work you do 
 
I so hope you ll all be able to help us build a fantastic project together 
The CitizenScience project with AutisticaUK and turinginst was heavily inspired by my desire to educate non autistic people about the little things they could do to make the anxiety and stress that autistic people feel when navigating the world just that little bit lighter 
What I love about this is that it costs me someone with typical hearing acuity and no sensory processing difficulties absolutely NOTHING to do this And it potentially helps so many people in the room 
 
Not just autistic people Anyone who struggles w hearing will benefit 
I remember pennyb saying just UseTheMic when you re talking Even if you can hear just fine there might be someone like them in the room who finds it much easier to follow your question if you wait seconds for someone to bring the mic to you 
I haven t rewatched the video this morning I apologise if I ve forgotten parts 
 
What I remember from pennyb s section is them talking about autistic people having SensoryProcessing challenges which mean that hearing what s going on in a large conference room is tough 
The video webinar that stuck with me the most was the one on Diversity Equity and Inclusion in the Open community 
 
And in particular the section by pennyb which starts around
