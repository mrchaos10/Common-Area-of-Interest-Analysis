roberthayes SamIam KingT celtics Or more like u need to realise that maybe he s just not good enough especially with better players around him 
SamIam roberthayes KingT celtics I mean if someone thinks Jaylen having decent game is acceptable then I think we know who actually watches the games properly 
roberthayes SamIam KingT celtics Yeah how did u know open your eyes and realise he s been awful of the season U probably think he s been better than mook u seem that deluded 
SamIam roberthayes KingT celtics He was decent enough but this is like a in occurrence There s a reason why I can assure u that u don t often have these debates Cos he doesn t give u a performance that deserves backing up

RBrady__ celtics Those calls were actually hurting me I couldn t even tell if there was contact but cos it was harden the refs obviously thought so

celtics I know it s early in the season but It just looks like they ve been made to play No energy taking low shots out rebounded and getting done easily on pick and roll 
CombineArtwork celtics Maybe brad wants him to learn the game a bit more before giving him more minutes which is understandable considering he s a year old rookie

M_V_Beard THE_JABARI_KING miigueelb_ __sportschief westbrookpg sz ldaoming JohanBackkV BULLETlN If that s how ur gonna compare them then that s fair but for me the better player is the one who comes up big in when it matters most and has proven it in in the finals which CP has never been to despite being years older He has more to his game yeah but no F appearance 
M_V_Beard THE_JABARI_KING miigueelb_ __sportschief westbrookpg sz ldaoming JohanBackkV BULLETlN So u just gonna forget about the history of injuries with CP but say he s better than kyrie But cos he doesn t play for rockets the injuries make kyrie less valuable than CP who s had countless injuries Also APG don t determine a players passing ability He s not shooting 
M_V_Beard THE_JABARI_KING miigueelb_ __sportschief westbrookpg sz ldaoming JohanBackkV BULLETlN What did those triple doubles get his team WCF Kyrie was suffering from numerous injuries throughout most the season so u can t compare their seasons We ll see who s more successful this season if they re both fully healthy bro 
THE_JABARI_KING M_V_Beard miigueelb_ __sportschief westbrookpg sz ldaoming JohanBackkV BULLETlN Man s trynna tell me harden is better than one of the most prolific PG s in the league who s in his prime Out of all those PG s mentioned tell me who delivers when it matters most more than uncle drew 
M_V_Beard miigueelb_ __sportschief westbrookpg sz ldaoming JohanBackkV BULLETlN Na but TP used to be elite He s so obviously wouldn t be in the conversation The thing for me that separates kyrie is that he can literally get any shot at any time in the game Also an underrated passer imo 
M_V_Beard miigueelb_ __sportschief westbrookpg sz ldaoming JohanBackkV BULLETlN Ur jokes mate Who has a ring CP is still really good but kyrie is in his prime and CP isn t as good as he once was Westbrook is nothing on kyrie as he takes awful shots And Steph isn t clutch There s an argument to say that none of them are better but it s an opinion 
DaveyP xSamuelSzx JuventusBelgium SkySportsNews Cristiano Looks like that trim doesn t serve ur opinions well There s no way u can watch messi and think anyone is better It s not even close 
miigueelb_ M_V_Beard __sportschief westbrookpg sz ldaoming JohanBackkV BULLETlN Which are better then

macfed TheF Na I m pretty sure they both know he s the best player pal But there s so many good passers and he doesn t get as much credit as others probably cos the dribbling goals and assists overshadow his passing 
JoMouFC Vintage_Utd Just cos his team might not have won finals how does that instantly mean it makes him the bottler At the end of the day the players are the ones out there so his team have been bottlers if anything 
austinwolos Huge_Gorilla I don t get how people like it They must have different gameplay or somin 
FUTTraderx With loads of cards quite expensive packs might be more worth it Plus u might pack an untradable duplicate of an expensive player so can sell it

PierreSpice MrDtAFC I believe it s called a gif 
mufcszn utdxtra I don t think people understand We haven t got the quality to play that way Yeah there are some high profile names but these players aren t good or consistent enough 
AreTho Josh MrDtAFC No mate DT is letting the AFTV fame get to his head He can give it but can t take it Treats other people like shit 
Jubhamba aceseddy No pal it was a disastrous tweet He doesn t give a fuck cos he hasn t got the passion and only seems to care when playing with France Probably only cos they won the wc 
LFC_Karan Nero OfficialFPL trippier No easy games in the big time pal When will people learn 
celtics KyrieIrving Kyrie 
Nobze aceseddy No people like u are deluded U can see he s not fully committed After the final whistle rashford is on the floor pissed off after giving everything and then there s pogba having a joke with kondogbia If he really cared he d show it by either trying or looking disappointed 
Jubhamba aceseddy What a disastrous tweet 
ryanoconnor celtics I agree Thankfully he s not gonna be part of the bench rotation but yeah I don t think he offers that much as of now 
AvidAnder FourFourJordan Herrera is fucking shit and inconsistent and offers no protection Pereira is understandable but matic should always start unless he s really been shit which he hasn t He s just been average 
ginormocunt Douglas AddyNas No this shit system and average inconsistent players around him is a huge part of why he s struggling Who can he link up with in that team It s shit U don t just lose ur talent after signing for a new team Fake cunt fans like u don t help when cheering when he comes off 
RealistYahz MourinhoMindset Init I don t get how people don t see it Don t get me wrong he has been poor with giving the ball away etc but what can he do when he s in a shit system with players that can t do link up play U can see he s lacking any confidence Rom s touch is like a cross field diag ffs 
ManUtd Embarrassing The fans don t fucking help cheering when Alexis comes off 
chacatwala Dazzling__David utdxtra He s actually been one of the best recently so not a great example mate

gordonhayward PlayersTribune TheAthletic Let s get it 
cxmthfc Don t think I ve ever agreed with a tweet more So many things wrong I m not gonna name half of them Driven shots Passing and build up play is impossible when it s so slow paced so the AI just intercept and tackle so easily 
alp JPizzleFIFA I guess u have completely different gameplay to me cos if u had my gameplay and said it was good then I d send for some serious help for u Don t u feel the gameplay is slow and clunky It s impossible to create chances when by the time you ve made a pass they ve read it 
OllieBrinkworth Louisburns ZameerKhAn TwoSyncOfficial Init Can t believe people like the gameplay 
Louisburns ZameerKhAn TwoSyncOfficial No the whole point was to improve the game and add new stuff but all it s done is ruin it and feels more like pes 
Griezmannility suckyourmumlnit He s gonna be

Fatherxh PassTheSaIt What an embarrassing tweet So much wrong with it that I m not even gonna explain On ur u fish

SkeptaStormzy zacparkes_ El_colombiano MattHDGamer Why do u have to let go of 
NBATV KingJames Did look like a travel to be fair But cos it s bron they probably think he s so good that he doesn t travel 
zacparkes_ El_colombiano MattHDGamer Shit yeah that s so obvious and I didn t even think of that cheers mate The gameplay is still slow and clunky imo I m guessing Matt and others who like it have different gameplay to me cos mine is horrible 
zacparkes_ El_colombiano MattHDGamer It didn t ruin Fifa at all It just meant there was more emphasis placed on how good u r defensively I suppose that s easy to say when I got I ve seen many people complain about driven shots Ur telling me u don t accidentally chip it instead of it doing a driven shot 
El_colombiano MattHDGamer Yeah it s so slow for me aswell So hard to split a defence open when they re passing at mph They ve ruined driven shots aswell Why tf do u have to press lb rb and b for it In the heat of the moment it s impossible to do a driven shot cos it just fucks up by chipping it 
AllezFutbol The fact that he s robbed someone before makes him a tosser that deserves no respect Fuck the respect bro mate

Flex_Mufc Chaelesy OsmanRiaz ManUtd Ibra_official No we don t play to his strengths Go and take a look back on his Everton goals and then tell me we play to his strengths It also doesn t help when quite a few teams park the bus so he has barely any space 
Flex_Mufc Chaelesy OsmanRiaz ManUtd Ibra_official I agree with all of that but he d give much more if we actually knew what a cross was Rashford doesn t often get into good positions so u can t judge his finishing really 
Flex_Mufc Chaelesy OsmanRiaz ManUtd Ibra_official But Rom offers so much more especially when u play to his strengths which we can t do cos we aren t consistently putting crosses in There s a reason he s got pl goals at only

jerj celtics It s just the brain dead people that think winning in pre season is more important than things like minutes for each player 
yuriheifen celtics U just said why s he taking them out that s why they re far off minutes Are u actually brain dead or what 
KawhiLeonardSZN celtics Yeah it s gonna be a tough season for the raptors Even without Lebronto it s still gonna be tough for u lot to get past teams like the C s philly wizards and pacers 
yuriheifen celtics It s called balancing the minutes u tool First game of the pre season he s not gonna get guys like Hayward or kyrie who haven t played for ages play 
UnitedRxn utdxtra You re repping Memphis who s best moment for Man Utd was when Lyon beat city ffs

WacaLaca MesutAssist JackIngarfill MrDtAFC UnitedStandMUFC How jokes I ll join in at laughing at United I know we re shit but deluded fans like u can t admit that their own team are wank 
jamielewis MesutAssist billy JackIngarfill MrDtAFC UnitedStandMUFC We re wasting our time pal I ve realised that anyone who defends a player as shit as ozil is shouldn t get a response I think it s actually embarrassing trynna defend someone who doesn t even look like he enjoys the game of football tbh 
MesutAssist WacaLaca JackIngarfill MrDtAFC UnitedStandMUFC Oh shit did matic and pogba die Pogba has been dog shit and has still had a more positive impact than both of those shit houses Even Fred and fellaini have been better If u don t agree then it sums up y u rep a player as washed as ozil 
MesutAssist jamielewis billy JackIngarfill MrDtAFC UnitedStandMUFC Remind me when was the last time ozil put in a few quality performances in consistently or turned up in a big game whether that s against one of the top or a crucial game Nope u can t cos he is a bottle job

EraOfEmery MUFCCathal Yeah thanks for telling me what I don t only do I watch arsenal almost just as much and bellerin is a joke of a player Why do u think even most Arsenal fans with a brain which u don t think he s shit Appalling of a response that guessing that I don t watch ur team 
EraOfEmery MUFCCathal He d be a shit winger can t dribble weak and scared of going forward No shooting or crossing accurately in the air ability Joke of a rep 
kamins isaiahthomas When will fools like u learn don t believe everything u read U didn t know him personally and weren t around him when this supposedly happened 
JakeSil UniqueRiggers In years of football 
JakeSil UniqueRiggers That doesn t make him better ffs CR got in ahead of messi Think we know who s better Also that was Salah s first world class season about years of football Come back when he s been as consistent as modric Ronaldo and Isco 
JakeSil UniqueRiggers How stupid do u have to be to think Isco isn t the better player Salah is the better goal scorer Apart from that Isco is better in every department If u think otherwise then u have been diagnosed with delusion son If u were a RM fan ur telling me u would say Mo is better 
JakeSil UniqueRiggers Isco is a class above salah It s not all about goals Stop with the bias and delusion pal 
usopen delpotrojuan Top role model and absolute class person and player He will win at least more slam I m sure 
aroman _superrsonic SilvinhaChicago maswibilili No matter how many more goals ronaldo gets than messi he should never be classed as better For messi to put up the numbers that he does as not even a striker is out of this world And for how special he is at what he does no one will ever surpass him There s no comparison 
EraOfEmery MUFCCathal U rep one of the worst and most inept full backs we might ever see can t believe people even rated him in the first place He literally offers nothing more often than not Could see from ages back that he s all hype No defensive brain can t cross in the air accurately 
Respect to DjokerNole and delpotrojuan class acts

gwanlad georgecdavies anthony xx grantrigz ClassicLukaku DalotEra LukeShaw Man calls me deluded after saying that Dalot bailly and rojo should be of the back U really think Dalot would do a better job than Valencia 
georgecdavies gwanlad anthony xx grantrigz ClassicLukaku DalotEra LukeShaw Able on the ball Have u seen the amount of times rojo lumps it up the pitch Bailly needs a different CB next to him Not any of these ones including smalling cos we all know that there is no partnership that works

djcampas usopen At the end of the day u should be blaming Serena s coach as if he knew the rules none of this shit woulda happened Also all Serena had to do was accept the CV and carry on The combination of the umpire Serena and her coach ruined Osaka s moment 
gwanlad anthony xx grantrigz ClassicLukaku DalotEra LukeShaw Jesus Christ bailly and rojo is like leaving angry dogs on their own It s just asking for trouble As much stick as smalling gets he is first choice easily imo Not great but the most reliable
