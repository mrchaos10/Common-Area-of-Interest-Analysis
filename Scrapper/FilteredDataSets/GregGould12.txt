Hmmm star recruit that is and done dont think so t co Dx exnnD 
rjw reginareal JJWatt Not tje point Sir should have never came to that you missed the boat 
Jefffos JJWatt I totally agree Colts fan here 
J_Galli NFL That official shoud be fired the was penalties one play head to head and pass interference it would have sealed the game for the saints and it should have been hands to the face on rhe Brees interception if it was Brady it would have been rhe Nfl is a joke 
The nfl need to start doing something to these officials that was bad pass interference and helmet to helmet

Tullyballs Official_TNL NFL That was not Manning we r talking Manning and Brady here sir 
Official_TNL Tullyballs NFL Yea he had to move out of our division so he could dominate that garbage division he is in and our kicker got of those rings lets face it all u Pats fans r the same Brady is a average qb at best out of that system 
Official_TNL Tullyballs NFL Not at all sir just admit it you r wrong Brady would be a average at best qb out of that system and when it mattered Manning Brady have good day Kiddd and watch KC whip that but today 
Official_TNL Tullyballs NFL And don t care about his playing status Deion is Deion 
Official_TNL Tullyballs NFL Not a troll at all just speaking facts and the Colts never got a punishment for any of your so called statements The Pats have been punished for there Illegal acts Tom is the product of a great system proven when he got hurt still won games the truth hurts Kiddddddd
