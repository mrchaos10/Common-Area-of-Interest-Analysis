MainManOziI Lacazette has scored or assisted against every top team yet he gets benched in big games Starting to piss me off

Honestly believe we ll lose to Liverpool this weekend They re the best team in England rn and my favs to win the title which is why we needed to win today 
Arsenal s best player is Mesut zil and we need to build the team around him If the manager can t see that then he ll lose the fans simple as that
