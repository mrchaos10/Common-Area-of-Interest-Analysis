Marcus Aurelius 
Translated by George Long 
But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men for it is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself For nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retire than into his own soul 
Let no act be done without a purpose nor otherwise than according to the perfect principles of art 
Men seek retreats for themselves houses in the country sea shores and mountains and thou too art wont to desire such things very much
