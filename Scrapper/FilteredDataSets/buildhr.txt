ndtv Good AK will not pay electricity bill ask people not to pay and now they will take action for mirroring them 
ndtv I thought Shazia would have repeated her inappropriate smile and posed to the camera rather than shed tears take the rebound 
ndtv Mr Kejriwal do you want us to believe what you say is only true and what others dig up from your back yard is all doctored 
when Modi mastan can cover up the stalking of the girl why not the self imposed months suspension 
ndtv yesterday Modi mastan goofed up on MK Gandhi and there is no detailed coverage in the news While Rahul s abstract remarks are sliced 
ndtv EC has censured Modi mastan s remarks and there is no mention in the media Are you all paid not to cover this 
ndtv actually every person in Gujarat should write to Modi mastan asking for security May be he will do it only for those he wants to 
ndtv for once the media will be on the back foot and stop playing trial by media 
AAP Arvind Kejriwal and shazia now will claim that BJP and Congress are behind the leaks 
EC is a caged bird of the Congress EC has rapped Modi mastan for his bloody comment 
Good Modi mastan rewards the accused MLA s in UP 
Jaitley is on high now trying to push the Tehelka case to settle scores on the media playing GOD all this while 
Modi mastan does not know the difference between Mothilal and Mohandass May be he is obsessed with the Nehru family 
Going by the new avatar of Politics Arvind Kejriwal all media people should be grouped along with Tehelka and painted in teh same brush 
Now all political party will go bonkers on Tehelka who was playing GOD all these days by doing sting operations and exposes 
sardesairajdeep will Modi ever talk on what BJP will do if it comes to power rather than throw abuses on the ruling party 
sardesairajdeep Should the question be Is the media completely sponsored or is there some responsible journalism 
after common wealth fiasco any thing that is done is inappropriate Amy be they should give way for the new govt and see them function 
One suggestion Shazia ilmi can try stop smiling inappropriately in the news talk show 
Arnab the news at is a clear fix getting people to have a go at Sanjay 
Narendra Modi touches the feet of Advani and this is news In TN every day people touch Jaya feet there is nothing new

This general assembly will be fought with and by the media Congress will fail badly only to come back 
Meenakshi Lekhi has a mandate to beat Arnab in shouting in TV shows 
VK Singh you are a shame to the nation I do not know how you managed to become a General 
Ran to the old hag Went to the yoga joker tried to adjust with the absconding govt servant Aravind finally jumped the Modi truck 
Generally Speaking General must be put behind bars for what he is dragged into by the aspiring PM VK singh thinks he can be another mush 
I guess Elections is going to be the upper caste taking a vengeance on all the reservations 
Great to hear Subramanian swamy suggesting india should be divided based on Hindus and muslims excellent keep it God bless India 
Spend on advertisement electronic media and have a plan for every day to make head lines your product PM candidate will be a hit 
Lessons for Jaya she also threw stones at the PM no one in the media covered her Look at Modi he only throws stones at the PM 
what if Advani is the rd front PM candidate 
Imagine a India which will have a eloquent speaking PM concerned about change in his guju way We are going to have a real change 
How is the media management done from the Modi office not even from BJP office 
every channel covers Modi s speech the media is high on Modi Is it that we will have the first PM who is made by the media 
When Modi can buy the media and constantly get the headlines why not Jaya Maya Manatha Sheela Sonia Vasundara Mufti 
How come the media covers every thing positive of Modi and everything negative of the PM 
The corporate should hunt for the media managers in the Modi den who can hijack the nation agenda for a better corporate performance 
media covers Modi more than the PM s speech what a shame 
waiting for BJP to come to power and rip the nation on a different line of thought 
A state CM is challenging the nation and the media is shamelessly taking money and truncating his speech God bless India 
Media should answer the nation in the first week of June when we have a disastrous election results Influence of mind is at its peak 
Paid media can cover me tomorrow if I can sponsor the complete day can Arnab Barka Rajdeep come up with their quote please 
Modi s speech from Gujarat is more important than the PM speech from the red fort Media is taking the nation on the wrong path 
some time back when the old hag and the mango party leader was covered showing the mood of the nation Where are they now 
Paid media is at its peak Every speech of Modi is covered wide and compared to the PM what a shame

BDUTT Pls don t suggest something which is not what we should be doing We did a mistake last month in Mumbai 
For GOD s sake don t try to kindle fire among people and make it sensational This case needs calm mind to bring long term solution

Sunitha Krishnan your idea of having a data base on the rapist and making it public is great 
wrong examples and role models have been projected by this media and today large groups have taken this route of road show 
Kejrewal and Ramdev shame on you to be there at India gate and piggy ride on this road show and make a political stunt 
Rahul Bose what you said in NDTV today has lot of sense Hope the agitated people hear you 
sardesairajdeep would like media anchors put sense in what is being sensationalized the rapist to be handed over to the protesters 
Where is my India why people are encouraged to take to streets and as expected turn violent 
BDUTT We would love to see you Rajdeep and Arnab modrated by Pranoy Roy on media anchors carried away by sensationalism 
Can there be Do s and Don ts printed and published to the media people Looks sensationalism is the only objective of these anchors 
Rape of the girl is very serious and need to handle this cultural issue very carefully Certainly not the Anna way 
What nonsense the media is broadcasting that the rapist should be handed over to the protesters 
Guess there is some amount of politics media is leading the public in this rape of the poor girl 
Media For GOD s sake don t make the voice of the public a political issue
