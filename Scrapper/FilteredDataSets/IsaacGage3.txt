AOC Not saying it cannot be done just that it s going to be one heck of a fight to persuade most in the country to do away with this foundational institution 
AOC However you cannot simply ignore the will of of the National constituency People in rural states will not stand for this As a newly elected Freshman politician in Washington you more than most other people should understand this 
AOC Problem with this is that if we decide to do away with the EC the already vanishingly small representation of less populated states disappears completely Our country would be controlled via aristocratic majoritarianism Perhaps not necessarily bad in some cases

So knowing this why do we constantly have this cycle between opposition parties where the minority pretends to care about the debt Nobody gives any Sugar Honey Ice Teas about National Debt If we did spending relative to revenue would precipitously decrease post haste 
Specifically I am referencing opportunity costs trade offs and the national debt which compounds annually at an enormous interest rate Our federal income taxes only service the interest on the debt The principal will never get touched 
We have had TRILLION dollar deficits annually for every fiscal year for a long time now The government was shutdown over BILLION dollars for a wall Take a moment to consider that Since when have lawmakers cared about economics

SpeakerPelosi The TrumpShutdown has already pushed hundreds of thousands of Americans to the breaking point Now it s pushing our air 
And thus a Constitutional Amendment explicitly banning digital unpersonning in all its various forms by ANY private company publicly traded or otherwise is absolutely necessary This should be a chance for bipartisan compromise The logic is obvious realDonaldTrump 
This happened with the transition from President Obama to President Trump and it s going to happen after Trump is long gone as well Both sides are guilty of political expediency and shortsightedness Right now it happens to be the Left that wants to ban everything
