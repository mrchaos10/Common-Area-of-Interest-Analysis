synapticity It s just that one is such obvious fake news and the MSM wonders why no one trusts it anymore 
TomRaftery Cost of flight vs land travel is not due to manufacturing issues like HDs were but due to gravity Whatever the cost of pushing a mass along a road is flying it will always be very much higher because it will take far more energy It can only be cheap if energy is near free 
TomRaftery Same benefits apply to taxicars and will come sooner EAVs on a road will be far more advanced by the time EAVs in the air are safe Plus the laws of physics can t be paid off with SV hype This is a high energy high cost option for high value uses or rich ppl 
TomRaftery Short hops have even worse economics the huge cost is gettig into the air and down again moving along it is relatively low cost It s why there are no helitaxis today except at very high price These will be for the rich there is no way they could be cheaper than an Uber

CondelynneLynne GeorgeMonbiot I d make sure I had the counterfactual before asserting the referendum was stolen in the current environment IMO the argument re the danger of Dark Money is correct but assuming that only people I don t like use it is naive partisan and diminishes it 
ilana_u Four questions we should be able to answer for every connected device Does it do what I expect it to do Does it do any 
GeorgeMonbiot You are right that Dark Money is a major problem for democracies in general but IMO it s naive to think it only went to Leave Also given there has been no light shed on Gvmnt spend on Remain where it came from etc IMO it also counts as dark right now 
GeorgeMonbiot It s naive to think all the Dark Money was only for Leave that s just the Grauniad s schtick I suspect just looking at Gvmnt spend on Remain would be interesting never mind other funding

OrinHite Frances_Coppola coindesk izakaminska cjenscook JOMICHELL dinisguarda We study the blockchain more as an economic business tool IMO the evidence implies there are many good enoughs much cheapers it has to contend with in order to replace many existing systems I have no idea what will happen to Bitcoins but the energy and time drain is bad news 
OrinHite Frances_Coppola coindesk izakaminska cjenscook JOMICHELL We ran an event last year on this dinisguarda gave a presentation his hypothesis is that corporates entities will set up their own walled blockchains for closed verticals far lower distb n nodes and hash calcs req d Less secure if breached but better performance 
OrinHite Frances_Coppola coindesk izakaminska cjenscook JOMICHELL That s kinda my point it has to find a new approach that is either or both of less internally secure and less distributed Whether Bitcoin forks its way out or is superseded by a nd Gen cryptocurrency approach is anyone s guess right now 
Frances_Coppola coindesk izakaminska cjenscook JOMICHELL Or run out of global electricity supply first 
Frances_Coppola coindesk izakaminska cjenscook JOMICHELL The Bitcoin blockchain uses a fully meshed network so op costs rise by the square of nodes transactions It s also a very high cost time lag system owing to the complex hashing calcs There are only ways out less complex ie less secure calcs or a non fully meshed network
