redddevils_ sompoch Back to the sender that s mission impossible 
BlindDaley innocent_atma ManUtd Once a red always a red forever we shall cherish that memory 
ManUtd I remember before Jose went back to Chelsea most fans were blaming Woodward for not going after him and now they want him out shame upon you it s our duty to stand by our manager I love his work Woodward just needs to deliver all what Jose needs and we shall be the champions 
ManUtd We all have seen some great football from pogba under Jose than for France is Jose to be blamed for his inconsistency Why can t we acknowledged the great work from Jose who develops him for a season for France to gain from Jose s hard work I believe we have some delicate fans 
ManUtd I m just fed up of people who claim to be utd fans and yet they can t even stand by the manager we are all aware that it s only under Jose that we have achieved a dream of going back where we belong sis sir Alex left our club why should you blame him for Woodward s failures 
nathan_jackz Every utd fan has to feel for Martial apart from some fans who are on loan at our club but he surely deserved to be there

reshmikasingh Lukaku was more of a team player than Hazard I said it last week that unless the manager solves the issue between Hazard and Lukaku they wouldn t pass France 
reshmikasingh He either wanted to show that he was the main man or that he is the right guy to replace CR 
reshmikasingh Reshmi it s a tough one for us as utd fans to choose from our players who to support however I hope Lukaku could make a record that could bring smile to all utd fans after Ronoldos transfer to Juve on the other hand I don t want to see pogba sad

sheshe_tom The manager has to solve the problem between Hazard and Lukaku before facing France otherwise it won t be good for them it s evident that hazard is jealous of lukaku scoring

MrBryanDavies Bryan that team lucked creativity no one was carrying the ball to forwards from midfield and the manager should have realised that he needed another midfielder and again he should have played Rashford as a winger due to his pace

nathan_jackz Team selection was another factor matic pogba and fella can t work together pogba was force to pull buck to defend rather than currying the ball forward so the front three had little services then another one was Darmian there is no word to describe his performance 
nathan_jackz It was one of our worse performances of the season first of all Rashford is to take part of the blame he should have passed the ball for his colleague but no he couldn t do that because he is mean and premature he thinks of himself not a team secondly our midfield was too sloppy
