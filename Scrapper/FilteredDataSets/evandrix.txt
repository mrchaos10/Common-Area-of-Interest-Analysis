this idea is inspired by my software engineering course back in uni to illustrate adapting to changes in user requirements a lab i enjoyed not dry like design patterns ugh and also me ditching the whole crappy unstable vm and tunnel and rewriting it all myself 
this should up the fun element from auditing and fixing vuln code this year to now writing safe code from scratch with the pressure of time 
offer the flag after a series of N correct responses to a service 
so players will query the service endpoint and host their service according to the same spec a spec was somewhat lacking this year 
just when they think they ve got it all sorted then sometime into the game announce changes in spec so the longer you take to implement the more points you lose 
instead of releasing source code release a seemingly simple spec for starters for players to check that they ve got things setup properly to play
