twofatfeet alexasp Sporf SLBenfica slbenfica_en What you saying is literally means nothing at the end of the day every team should start at the bottom and work there way up irrespective of score lines or any of that shit They shouldn t even be given a chance to leapfrog the lower divisions 
twofatfeet alexasp Sporf SLBenfica slbenfica_en Just because they are better than all those teams doesn t mean that they should leap frog them in the league They need to prove that they are better than the lower league teams first It s retarded how you think that then going into the top league is fair it s the opposite 
twofatfeet alexasp Sporf SLBenfica slbenfica_en It s not about bullying other teams It s about being fair If someone created a team and filled it with world class player they shouldn t be allowed to go into the top league they should start at the bottom 
twofatfeet alexasp Sporf SLBenfica slbenfica_en It s not unfair unfair is putting a new team in the top league You can t just go straight to the top you should start at the bottom like everyone does 
twofatfeet alexasp Sporf SLBenfica slbenfica_en How you think a team going straight into the top division is fair is beyond me

genmander Minshy Sporf NUFC themichaelowen Don t mention the contradiction you made The facts are the majority of premier league fans don t know this guy If you want to argue that they will soon all know him then that s fine but he s not been covered enough for the majority of mainstream fans to know him

genmander Minshy Sporf NUFC themichaelowen You can defend it all you want the facts remain majority of people have no clue who he is he hasn t been covered as much as you make out people STILL don t know who he is after the transfer and there will be plenty on match day asking who he is as well 
genmander Minshy Sporf NUFC themichaelowen Yeah ok of course you do weeks ago majority of premiership fans had no idea who this is FACT 
Karleaves_ DevilsStandUTD alx_spacecowboy premierleague people eat rats in their council house in Liverpool 
genmander Minshy Sporf NUFC themichaelowen Face facts he wasn t that well covered it s not as though everyone has been talking about him
