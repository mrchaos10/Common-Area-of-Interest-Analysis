PicturesFoIder t co Yhwgfq Jg 
I don t know how other booking websites are and I m sure I signed up for T amp Cs for it but I do think it is really really wild that they re handing out bank card info to sketchy dudes all over the world and I imagine people don t really know about it that much 
Which most of the time would be fine but as I learned from this experience some hotels are sketchy as hell 
What s really wild is that I need to give t co hMMBy PJqM a copy of my credit card bill to show I paid because they don t have a record of it What happens when you book with them is that they pass on your card info to the hotel 
Refund never came through It turns out the issue is that the hotel is apparently allowed to say no we changed our mind after agreeing to process the refund and that s fine 
This thread is not just me complaining honest 
 
I don t know what kind of set up they have going on over there at all 
 
I phoned boookingcom to cancel the hotel I was staying in because it was too noisy they spoke to the hotel sorted it out

I ve taken a lot of crap about England s chances of doing well at the World Cup this year but I m yet to take crap from someone whose country s team qualified this year so _ _ 
I imagine every teacher would be comfortable confronting explicit racism in their classroom From what I get from this blog post that d also be indoctrination if it is indoctrinate away 
because allowing a wrong view to go unchallenged gives tacit legitimacy to that view 
If you say nothing after a student says Trump is a great man that s a political statement in itself If you say Well he has this track record of saying racist things and being accused of sexual assault would that change your mind on his greatness it s better 
There also are some things that are just wrong and I think it s okay to talk to students about that I remember getting asked about Trump a lot last year and also had lots of students say good things about him in class 
 
 
This is a really interesting article from ebefl but I m not sure I agree with it Teaching will always be a political act The idea that it s hard to be political well doesn t mean it s pointless to try doing it better

Thank you again and I will probably tweet again tomorrow or later next week from a conferancing rather than teaching point of view 
There was one plenary in particular that I thought was full of not just knowledge but wisdom Really inspiring 
Thing I have been to a reasonable number of conferences now and sometimes I enjoy them but don t see lots of new stuff Today was full of interesting new things Sessions about teacher burnout the importance of community feminism in ELT and many other sessions 
I did a lot of walking around checking up that sessions had started and so got to see numbers in sessions Things seemed pretty balanced and the most attended session was one by a female non native speaker which is cool 
There are a couple of really specific things I wanted to talk about that I think are great We had some chat this weekend and before about a bad balance in terms of people attending men s sessions or native speaker s sessions 
AnnLoseva thhourspecial and Matt are such an awesome team and put in so much work All the sessions I saw had really active and interesting discussions in the audience which is great 
I feel so fortunate inspired and exhausted after ExcitELT So many excellent sessions and wonderful people Lots of new friends and people I m glad to see again

thhourspecial RobertTaylorELT seburnt excitELT I still like and will go to big conferences hopefully my first JALT in but small conferences and local events are definitely something that I think the TEFL community needs more of 
thhourspecial RobertTaylorELT seburnt The last thing I really like about small conferences is I probably spoke to everyone who came to excitELT tried and failed in 
thhourspecial RobertTaylorELT seburnt This could also be trying to have more diverse featured plenary speakers trying to be cheaper trying to be more social having better coffee or whatever else you want to promote 
thhourspecial RobertTaylorELT seburnt And then also smaller conferences are maybe freer to experiment and promote things too If you think presentations are too didactic it s much easier to do something about that at a small conference If it works the change can be tried at big conferences too 
thhourspecial RobertTaylorELT seburnt but I do think small conferences are important to provide that alternative some conferences are quite unaffordable for me at least so having options which doesn t just mean small conferences is important 
thhourspecial RobertTaylorELT seburnt This is me on the issue but of course there is an extensive but coming t co i J RPkeN 
thhourspecial RobertTaylorELT seburnt Generally I think there are some people who are going to small conferences as their first and then moving onto larger ones that s fine by me It goes the other way too

ESLBarry The fans understand this stuff they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes to realise that they re not just funny they say something deep about TEACHING As a consequence people who dislike ESLBarry truly ARE idiots 
ESLBarry There s also Barry s nihilistic outlook which is deftly woven into his tweets his personal pedagogy draws heavily from Paulo Freire s Pedagogy of the Oppressed for instance

thhourspecial I ranted too much and so didn t go into problems with this design it also seems mean spirited but you re right 
Sarah_TTrainer Kind of flattering we do put a lot of love into the design for these events though and it d be nice if this didn t happen 
excitELT Night night

excitELT Given that this has been an obnoxiously niche thread Here s a competition 
If you want someone to be incredibly nerdy about ELT and graphic design for you please check out excitELT or t co BPK nJs 
Anyhow most of the point here is to share some of the work that goes into design and some of the cool things we sneak in there 
But I don t want to get the look taken because that doesn t benefit anyone I saw that poster amp thought it was announcing excitelt 
I m also really happy for other conferences to take ideas like the posters not booklets thing or even the blank space layout 
I m very happy that people don t notice this stuff because it still makes the conference better and these details make the difference 
to things like hanbok and citypop 
And I kind of hope people can somehow feel that we put in a lot of love even though they ll never know about the obscure homages 
The idea is that these design decisions make people have slightly easier and more pleasant conference 
Not because they re rude but because they probably didn t notice 
The point is this no one really said oh you ve obviously spent a day typesetting this booklet or thinking about posters to me 
Booklets are distracting and the posters became a congregation point between sessions We did this to make the conference more social 
We also didn t hand out paper conference booklets we had prominently displayed A posters instead More a design than a budget choice 
We only used Futura for the whole document but the hierarchies of information are incredibly clear and I m really proud of how it looks 
I spent ages realising the numbers should be red and also making the headers work 
It didn t look quite right till I made the numbers in the bottom left red Somehow this balances the page a lot more 
It s a deliberate design decision to make it easy to find sessions It took me hours testing layouts to find this one 
Look at the conference where the sessions are and see and all the blank space on the left next to the names 
The question people always ask at conferences is What s on next so the time periods are in columns not rows you read left to right 
Designing a conference booklet s typesetting takes ages because people are often spending a lot of time looking for specific info 
The red for the excitELT Tokyo conference came from the Japanese flag I really hope people guessed this one 
I don t really think of this as stealing because excitELT isn t a citypop album and we didn t use the italic font 
It seemed like a cool homage to an album that seems freaky and modern years after it s release excitELTsquadgoals 
This might actually be Extra Bold Italic 
Haruomi Hosono uses Futura Bold Italic on the cover of woozy masterpiece Pacific 
 
 
excitELT fact even AnnLoseva doesn t know Futura Bold ended up being used because I was listening to Japanese Citypop 
LanguageOnion hallg For excitELT Tokyo I wanted a more dynamic font I remember spending a day looking at fonts online and nothing really worked 
True fact I don t even think LanguageOnion or hallg know The excitELT Seoul purple is taken from a hanbok dress 
The reason the colour is linked to the location is that it was important for us that the conference had a strong link to the area 
We kept the text over cityscape thing from Seoul but we also kept the idea of the colour being linked to the location 
We changed a bunch of the design stuff from excitELT Seoul The biggest reason for this was that I got good at design between conferences 
Going on a Twitter rant Tweetstorm about the design process for excitELT Tokyo Niche area but I ll be sharing some stuff no one knows 
Is this a really small thing to get mad over For comparison please check out the excitELT conference booklet t co Mf xt ghyA

A busy semester is coming up but never feel like you don t have the right to be a lazy teacher Night night 
When you have no time to plan it s way harder to be chalk and talk and much easier to be student centred 
I d even go so far as to say that often the best classes I teach are the ones I spend the least time planning 
So spend lt mins planning a min class I got a lot of looks as if I was crazy for saying 
I had a dinner with some teachers last year and told them that I made a promise to spend less time planning than teaching 
Honestly it s fine if you do but if you just take the thing that worked last year and run it back you re a really good teacher too 
There s this thing where teachers are like Oh I spent hour preparing this class I m going to use once 
If you want to go above and beyond feel free but you don t owe it to anyone 
To be honest you probably don t have any other obligation to be anything more than pretty decent at your job
