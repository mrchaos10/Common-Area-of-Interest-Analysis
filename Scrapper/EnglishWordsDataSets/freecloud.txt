a

the

was 
that

the

what

also

Cost 
of 
flight 
vs 
land 
travel 
is 
not 
due 
to 
manufacturing 
issues 
like

due 
to 
gravity 
Whatever 
the 
cost 
of 
pushing 
a 
mass 
along 
a 
road 
is 
flying 
it 
will 
always 
be 
very 
much 
higher 
because 
it 
will 
take 
far 
more 
energy 
It 
can 
only 
be

if

made 
more

OK

you 
d 
have 
a 
point 
but 
they 
have 
a 
certain 
for 
playing 
cup 
shuffle 
tricks 
with 
taxable 
revenues 
Never 
mind 
if 
the

coverage 
of

is 
anything 
to 
go 
by

the

my

is 
either

both

internally 
secure

less

Whether
