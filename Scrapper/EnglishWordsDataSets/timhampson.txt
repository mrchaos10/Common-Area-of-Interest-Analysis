I 
m 
not 
sure 
if 
I 
just 
studied

harder

personally 
found 
it 
easy 
Saying 
was 
hard 
and 
and 
were 
hard 
to 
tell 
apart 
but 
tense 
was 
never 
too 
confusing 
Maybe 
hard 
to 
say 
things 
the 
way 
a 
Korean 
would 
but 
always 
pretty 
easy 
to 
say

about

a

with 
bits 
of 
paper 
unrelated 
to 
TESOL 
though 
Not 
sure 
if 
that 
s 
a 
China

SK 
thing 
exclusively 
but 
I 
d 
say 
that 
a

in 
something 
random 
will 
get 
you 
further 
than

This 
probably 
t 
that 
true 
in

Think 
it 
s 
good 
if 
Japan 
cares 
though 
And 
maybe 
most 
importantly 
I 
don 
t

much

from

I 
imagine 
every

would 
be 
comfortable 
confronting

racism 
in

classroom 
From 
what 
I 
get 
from

post 
that 
d 
also 
be 
indoctrination 
if 
it 
is 
indoctrinate 
away 
because 
allowing 
a 
wrong 
view 
to 
go 
unchallenged 
gives 
tacit 
legitimacy 
to 
that 
view 
If 
you 
say 
nothing 
after 
a 
student 
says 
Trump 
is 
a 
great 
man 
that 
s 
a 
political 
statement 
in 
itself 
If 
you 
say 
Well 
he 
has 
this 
track 
record 
of 
saying 
racist 
things 
and 
being 
accused 
of 
sexual 
assault 
would 
that 
change 
your 
mind 
on 
his 
greatness 
it 
s 
better 
There 
also 
are 
some 
things 
that 
are 
just 
wrong 
and 
I 
think 
it 
s 
okay 
to 
talk 
to 
students 
about 
that 
I 
remember 
getting 
asked 
about

a

were 
also 
great 
as 
a 
presenter 
and 
kettle

Thank 
you 
again 
and 
I 
will 
probably 
tweet 
again 
tomorrow 
or 
later 
next 
week 
from 
a 
rather 
than 
teaching 
point 
of 
view 
There 
was 
one 
plenary 
in 
particular 
that 
I 
thought 
was 
full 
of 
not 
just 
knowledge 
but 
wisdom 
Really 
inspiring 
Thing 
I 
have 
been 
to 
a 
reasonable 
number 
of 
conferences 
now 
and 
sometimes 
I 
enjoy 
them 
but 
don 
t 
see 
lots 
of 
new 
stuff 
Today 
was 
full 
of 
interesting 
new 
things 
Sessions 
about 
teacher 
burnout 
the 
importance 
of 
community 
feminism 
in 
and 
many 
other 
sessions 
I 
did 
a 
lot 
of 
walking 
around 
checking 
up 
that 
sessions 
had 
started 
and 
so 
got 
to 
see 
numbers 
in 
sessions 
Things 
seemed 
pretty 
balanced 
and 
the 
most 
attended 
session 
was 
one 
by 
a 
female 
non 
native 
speaker 
which 
is 
cool 
There 
are 
a 
couple 
of 
really 
specific 
things 
I 
wanted 
to 
talk 
about 
that 
I 
think 
are 
great 
We 
had 
some 
chat 
this 
weekend 
and 
before 
about 
a 
bad 
balance 
in 
terms 
of 
people 
attending 
men 
s 
sessions 
or 
native 
speaker 
s 
sessions 
and 
Matt 
are 
such 
an 
awesome 
team 
and 
put 
in 
so 
much 
work 
All 
the 
sessions 
I 
saw 
had 
really 
active 
and 
interesting 
discussions 
in 
the 
audience 
which 
is 
great 
I 
feel 
so 
fortunate 
inspired 
and 
exhausted 
after 
So 
many 
excellent 
sessions 
and 
wonderful 
people 
Lots 
of 
new 
friends 
and 
people 
I 
m 
glad

Dabbing 
at 
conferences 
is 
a 
thing 
now 
but 
basically 
restricted 
to 
snide 
comments 
and 
most 
people 
are 
very 
supportive 
turf 
wars 
are 
real 
And 
you 
cannot 
lie 
Agreed 
I 
think 
what 
Marc 
and 
I 
are 
saying 
is 
that 
we 
are 
people 
who 
want 
them 
don 
t 
think 
smaller 
events 
will 
be 
pushed 
into 
obscurity 
as 
long 
as 
they 
are 
innovative 
and 
keep 
putting 
on 
a 
good 
event 
They 
do 
both 
already 
exist 
I 
think 
would 
be 
better 
if 
we 
had 
more 
small 
ones 
and 
that 
would 
also 
be 
better 
for 
big 
conferences 
I 
still 
like 
and 
will 
go 
to 
big 
conferences 
hopefully 
my 
first 
in 
but 
small 
conferences 
and 
local 
events 
are 
definitely 
something 
that 
I 
think 
the 
TEFL 
community 
needs 
more 
of 
The 
last 
thing 
I 
really 
like 
about 
small 
conferences 
is 
I 
probably 
spoke 
to 
everyone 
who 
came 
to 
tried 
and 
failed 
in 
This 
could 
also 
be 
trying 
to 
have 
more 
diverse 
featured 
plenary 
speakers 
trying 
to 
be 
cheaper 
trying 
to 
be 
more 
social 
having 
better 
coffee 
or 
whatever 
else 
you 
want 
to 
promote 
And 
then 
also 
smaller 
conferences 
are 
maybe 
freer 
to 
experiment 
and 
promote 
things 
too 
If 
you 
think 
presentations 
are 
too 
didactic 
it 
s 
much 
easier 
to 
do 
something 
about 
that 
at 
a 
small 
conference 
If 
it 
works 
the 
change 
can 
be 
tried 
at 
big 
conferences 
too 
but 
I 
do 
think 
small 
conferences 
are 
important 
to 
provide 
that 
alternative 
some 
conferences 
are 
quite 
for 
me 
at 
least 
so 
having 
options 
which 
t 
just 
mean 
small 
conferences 
is 
important 
This 
is 
me 
on 
the 
issue 
but 
of 
course 
there 
is 
an 
extensive

coming

Generally 
I 
think 
there 
are 
some 
people 
who 
are 
going 
to 
small 
conferences 
as 
their 
first 
and 
then 
moving 
onto 
larger 
ones 
that 
s 
fine 
by 
me 
It 
goes 
the 
other 
way 
too 
As 
a 
small 
conference 
organizer 
people 
often 
assume 
that 
there 
s 
an 
us 
vs 
them 
mentality 
which 
I 
don 
t 
have

so 
t

you

Kind 
of 
flattering 
we 
do 
put 
a 
lot 
of 
love 
into 
the 
design 
for 
these 
events 
though 
and 
it 
d 
be 
nice 
if 
this

happen 
Night

If 
you 
can 
also 
guess 
the 
reason 
it 
being 
inspired 
by 
that 
thing 
that 
s 
at 
least 
one 
more 
If 
you 
can 
tell 
me 
what 
the

Given 
that 
this 
has 
been 
an 
obnoxiously 
niche 
thread 
Here 
s 
a 
competition 
If 
you 
want 
someone 
to 
be 
incredibly 
nerdy 
about

Anyhow 
most 
of 
the 
point 
here 
is 
to 
share 
some 
of 
the 
work 
that 
goes 
into 
design 
and 
some 
of 
the 
cool 
things 
we 
sneak 
in 
there 
But 
I 
don 
t 
want 
to 
get 
the 
look 
taken 
because 
that 
t 
benefit 
anyone 
I 
saw 
that 
poster 
amp 
thought 
it 
was 
announcing 
I 
m 
also 
really 
happy 
for 
other 
conferences 
to 
take 
ideas 
like 
the 
posters 
not 
booklets 
thing 
or 
even 
the 
blank 
space 
layout 
I 
m 
very 
happy 
that 
people 
don 
t 
notice 
this 
stuff 
because 
it 
still 
makes 
the 
conference 
better 
and 
these 
details 
make 
the 
difference 
to 
things 
like 
and 
And 
I 
kind 
of 
hope 
people 
can 
somehow 
feel 
that 
we 
put 
in 
a 
lot 
of 
love 
even 
though 
they 
ll 
never 
know 
about 
the 
obscure 
homages 
The 
idea 
is 
that 
these 
design 
decisions 
make 
people 
have 
slightly 
easier 
and 
more 
pleasant 
conference 
Not 
because 
they 
re 
rude 
but 
because 
they 
probably 
t 
notice 
The 
point 
is 
this 
no 
one 
really 
said 
oh 
you 
obviously 
spent 
a 
day 
typesetting 
this 
booklet 
or 
thinking 
about 
posters 
to 
me 
Booklets 
are 
distracting 
and 
the 
posters 
became 
a 
congregation 
point 
between 
sessions 
We 
did 
this 
to 
make 
the 
conference 
more 
social 
We 
also 
t 
hand 
out 
paper 
conference 
booklets 
we 
had 
prominently 
displayed 
A

instead 
More 
a 
design 
than 
a 
budget 
choice 
We 
only 
used 
for 
the 
whole 
document 
but 
the 
hierarchies 
of 
information 
are 
incredibly 
clear 
and 
I 
m 
really 
proud 
of 
how 
it 
looks 
I 
spent 
ages 
the 
numbers 
should 
be 
red 
and 
also 
making 
the 
headers 
work 
It 
t 
look 
quite 
right 
till 
I 
made 
the 
numbers 
in 
the 
bottom 
left 
red 
Somehow 
this 
balances 
the 
page 
a 
lot 
more 
It 
s 
a 
deliberate 
design 
decision 
to 
make 
it 
easy 
to 
find 
sessions 
It 
took 
me 
hours 
testing 
layouts 
to 
find

always

Designing 
a 
conference 
booklet 
s

takes

The 
red 
for 
the 
Tokyo 
conference 
came 
from 
the 
Japanese 
flag 
I 
really 
hope 
people 
guessed 
this 
one 
I 
don 
t 
really 
think 
of 
this 
as 
stealing 
because 
t 
a 
album 
and 
we 
t 
use 
the

It 
seemed 
like 
a 
cool 
homage 
to 
an 
album 
that 
seems 
freaky

after 
it

taken 
from

The 
reason 
the 
is 
linked 
to 
the 
location 
is 
that 
it 
was 
important 
for 
us 
that 
the 
conference 
had 
a 
strong 
link 
to 
the 
area 
We 
kept 
the 
text 
over

thing 
from 
Seoul 
but 
we 
also 
kept 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
being 
linked 
to 
the 
location 
We 
changed 
a 
bunch 
of 
the 
design 
stuff 
from

The 
biggest 
reason 
for 
this 
was 
that 
I 
got 
good 
at

I 
think 
so 
but 
that 
s 
not 
how 
people 
tell 
it 
when 
it

A

I

I 
like 
my

anything

A 
busy 
semester 
is 
coming 
up 
but 
never 
feel 
like 
you 
don 
t 
have 
the 
right 
to 
be 
a 
lazy 
teacher 
Night 
night 
When 
you 
have 
no 
time 
to 
plan 
it 
s 
way 
harder 
to 
be 
chalk 
and 
talk 
and 
much 
easier 
to 
be 
student 
I 
d 
even 
go 
so 
far 
as 
to 
say 
that 
often 
the 
best 
classes 
I 
teach 
are 
the 
ones 
I 
spend 
the 
least 
time 
planning 
So 
spend 
planning 
a 
min 
class 
I 
got 
a 
lot 
of 
looks 
as 
if 
I 
was 
crazy 
for 
saying 
I 
had 
a 
dinner 
with 
some 
teachers 
last 
year 
and 
told 
them 
that 
I 
made 
a 
promise 
to 
spend 
less 
time 
planning 
than 
teaching 
Honestly 
it 
s 
fine 
if 
you 
do 
but 
if 
you 
just 
take 
the 
thing 
that 
worked 
last 
year 
and 
run 
it 
back 
you 
re 
a 
really 
good 
teacher 
too 
There 
s 
this 
thing 
where 
teachers 
are 
like 
Oh 
I 
spent 
hour 
preparing 
this 
class 
I 
m 
going 
to 
use 
once 
If 
you 
want 
to 
go 
above 
and 
beyond 
feel 
free 
but 
you 
don 
t 
owe 
it 
to 
anyone 
To 
be 
honest 
you 
probably 
don 
t 
have 
any 
other 
obligation 
to 
be 
anything 
more 
than 
pretty 
decent 
at 
your 
job 
I 
really 
can 
t 
stand 
this 
teachers

martyrs 
narrative 
that 
goes

the

Tipsy 
hot 
take 
incoming 
but 
it 
does 
pay 
the 
bills 
so 
I 
get 
a 
cocktail 
every 
time 
someone 
checks 
their 
phone 
And 
yeah 
it 
s 
a 
Beijing 
bar 
But 
can 
you 
imagine 
being 
the 
person 
who 
cuts 
off 
everyone

free 
drinks 
A 
bar 
I 
went 
to 
today 
has 
a 
thing 
where 
you 
can 
have 
unlimited 
drinks 
for

until 
someone 
checks 
their

Just
