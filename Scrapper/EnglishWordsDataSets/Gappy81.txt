Just 
walked 
past 
a

the 
pain 
of

Asked 
the

Now 
if 
the 
next 
part 
of 
this 
story 
pans 
out 
as 
I 
was 
told 
yesterday 
English 
football 
might 
Battles 
imagine 
telling 
your 
kid 
that 
your 
dad 
could 
be 
anyone 
of 
blokes 
yeah 
he 
resigned 
at 
a 
board 
meeting 
yesterday 
for 
the 
Wolves 
job 
Gutted 
he 
s 
gone 
but 
I 
think 
both 
needed 
a 
change 
he 
t 
pushed 
mate 
I 
can 
tell 
you 
that 
for 
sure 
My 
first 
decision 
as 
manager 
of 
would 
be 
to 
stick 
N 
in 
the 
reserves 
for 
the 
next 
years 
just 
about 
to 
submit 
my 
CV 
now 
I 
m 
officially 
putting 
name 
out 
there 
for

t 
expecting 
this

Well

a 
very 
cool

This 
pulsating 
v

And 
all 
for 
the 
of

must 
feel 
suicidal
