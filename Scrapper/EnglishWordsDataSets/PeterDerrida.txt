You 
guys 
have 
messed 
up 
evangelicals 
who 
are 
quick 
to 
chase 
after 
anything 
that 
tickles 
their 
ears 
and 
your 
eschatology 
is 
nothing 
but 
that 
Poor 
kids 
who 
t 
allowed 
to 
watch 
regular 
sci 
had 
to 
get 
this 
weirdo 
sci 
Bible 
interpretation 
from 
you 
guys 
So 
where 
does 
Paul 
say 
it 
s 
okay 
to 
steal 
now 
Yes 
the 
end 
of 
the 
world 
as 
they 
knew 
it 
AD 
was 
that 
end 
Where 
does 
it 
say 
third 
temple 
Come 
on 
Mr 
I 
Only 
Follow 
the 
Bible 
and 
Not 
Man 
Made 
Traditions 
where 
s 
the 
verse 
It 
is 
a 
religion 
You 
deny 
it 
because 
you 
bought 
into 
the 
whole 
It 
s 
a 
personal 
relationship 
not 
a 
religion 
new 
line 
Christianity 
is 
a 
religion 
We 
have 
rituals 
We 
have 
sacred 
texts 
We 
gather 
on 
a 
specified 
day 
We 
have 
do 
s 
and 
don 
ts 
See 
here 
s 
the 
thing 
Jesus 
was 
not 
a 
hyper 
He 
saw 
the 
spiritual 
meaning 
in 
those 
words 
He 
t 
say 
gross 
that 
is 
it 
and 
making 
it 
symbolic 
He 
t 
talking 
about 
a 
political 
figure 
like 
you 
imagine 
because 
you 
think 
like 
zealots 
Look 
at 
what 
Jesus 
said 
He 
has 
sent 
me 
to 
proclaim 
liberty 
to 
the 
captives 
Did 
Jesus 
do 
that 
in 
your 
hyper 
literal 
sense 
of 
treating 
the 
bible 
To 
set 
at 
liberty 
those 
who 
are 
oppressed 
Did 
Jesus 
do 
that 
hyper 
literally 
I 
have 
heard 
almost 
every 
claim 
Luke 
supports 
their 
point 
of 
view 
but 
to 
me 
I 
find 
it 
mind 
boggling 
If 
Jesus 
t 
spell 
it 
out 
for 
you 
how 
many 
of 
you 
guys 
would 
even 
recognize 
that 
as 
being 
fulfilled 
Jesus 
pointed 
to 
a 
fulfilled 
prophecy 
Do 
even 
allow 
for 
that 
to 
be 
a 
possibility 
You 
guys 
just 
have 
string 
after 
strong 
after 
string 
of 
unfulfilled 
prophecy 
after 
prophecy 
that 
to 
an 
outsider 
makes 
it 
look 
make 
believe 
There 
is 
no 
rapture 
Your 
escapist 
theology 
is 
bankrupt 
What 
about 
someone 
who 
stirs 
up 
divisions 
between 
Jesus 
and 
Paul 
and 
the 
Apostles 
and 
Jesus 
brothers 
James 
and 
Jude 
Is 
that 
cool 
t 
co 
DU 
You 
just 
made 
two 
false 
assertions 
What 
you 
call 
the 
rapture 
is 
Christ 
descending 
in 
the 
glory 
cloud 
the 
resurrection 
of 
the 
dead 
and 
the 
gathering 
of 
his 
people 
and 
the 
final 
judgment 
It 
is 
basically 
the 
end 
of 
history 
You 
never 
read 
a 
book 
by 
them 
but 
yet 
you 
somehow 
knew 
who 
the 
guy 
in 
the 
picture 
was 
Curious 
This 
t 
a 
letter 
from 
the 
future 
Learn 
how 
to 
read 
scripture 
without 
imposing 
your 
strange 
fantasies 
on 
it 
Even 
most 
find 
it 
silly 
That 
s 
in 
your 
imagination 
You 
said 
it 
you 
re 
not 
part 
of 
the 
Christian 
religion 
You 
don 
t 
know 
how 
to 
read 
scripture 
In 
fact 
your 
approach 
to 
reading 
prophecy 
is 
perverse 
So 
I 
see 
you 
don 
t 
think 
the 
th 
commandment 
applies 
to 
you 
t 
co 
ob 
This 
is 
basically 
pointless 
because 
I 
keep 
telling 
you 
that 
you 
have 
an 
Israeli 
Zionist 
zealot 
misconception 
of 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
God 
and 
you 
just 
keep 
ignoring 
me 
That 
already 
really 
actually 
happened 
in 
real 
actual 
history 
BTW 
Thank 
you 
The 
bronchitis 
is 
gone 
Just 
finished 
the 
last 
antibiotic 
Does 
being 
surrounded 
by 
armies 
and 
having 
to 
flee 
into 
the 
mountains 
sounds 
like 
a 
time 
of 
peace 
Jeremiah 
is 
about 
the 
restoration 
of 
Israel 
after 
Babylonian 
captivity 
BTW 
So 
when 
you 
hear 
Paul 
speak 
of 
peace 
you 
interpret 
that 
to 
mean 
not 
spiritual 
peace 
not 
peace 
with 
God 
through 
reconciliation 
but 
rather 
as 
not 
being 
persecuted 
or 
harmed 
in 
an 
earthly 
way 
When 
did 
Paul 
write 
about 
this 
peace 
When 
he 
was 
being 
beaten 
in 
a 
jail 
cell 
Children 
it 
is 
the 
last 
hour 
and 
as 
you 
have 
heard 
that 
is 
coming 
so 
now 
many 
have 
come 
Therefore 
we 
know 
that 
it 
is 
the 
last 
hour 
Was 
this 
written 
last 
week 
The 
th 
week 
is 
about 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
second 
temple 
BTW 
The 
clear 
scripture 
is 
that 
John 
said 
he 
was 
writing 
during 
the 
tribulation 
He 
also 
said 
the 
was 
in 
the 
world 
in 
the 
s 
when 
he 
wrote 
You 
guys 
are 
waiting 
for 
a 
train 
that 
left 
the 
station 
almost 
years 
ago 
Those 
already 
happened 
Also 
please 
note 
this 
They 
already 
happened 
and 
those 
were 
two 
totally 
separate 
events 
separated 
by 
hundreds 
of 
years 
You 
deny 
all 
those 
people 
faced 
cruel 
deaths 
during 
a 
massive 
persecution 
of 
the 
Church 
What 
are 
you 
talking 
about 
Please 
clarify 
because 
this 
sounds 
like 
nonsense 
There 
you 
go 
separating 
them 
again 
I 
never 
knew 
you 
That 
s 
a 
long 
answer 
Could 
you 
get 
more 
specific 
There 
is 
no 
third 
temple 
in 
Scripture 
The 
Apostle 
John 
wrote 
during 
the 
Tribulation 
Paul 
got 
his 
head 
chopped 
off 
during 
the 
Tribulation 
Peter 
was 
executed 
during 
the 
Tribulation 
James 
was 
thrown 
off 
the 
Temple 
during 
the 
Tribulation 
They 
were 
all 
Christians 
BTW 
I 
am 
catholic 
with 
a 
small 
c 
I 
m 
not 
ashamed 
of 
it 
The 
Kingdom 
and 
the 
atonement 
are 
intricately 
linked 
They 
cannot 
be 
separated 
It 
is 
the 
King 
who 
forgives 
It 
is 
the 
King 
who 
grants 
citizenship 
It 
is 
the 
King 
who 
has 
the 
power 
over 
life 
and 
death 
It 
s 
based 
on 
the 
Bible 
You 
just 
don 
t 
now 
how 
to 
read 
it 
The 
second 
Temple 
is 
gone 
Matthew 
is 
fulfilled 
There 
is 
no 
do 
over 
Accept 
it 
I 
m 
sorry 
but 
you 
might 
have 
a 
truncated 
Gospel 
What 
does 
mean 
without 
the 
incarnation 
What 
does 
some 
guy 
being 
perfect 
and 
dying 
unjustly 
have 
to 
do 
with 
grace 
if 
he 
does 
not 
have 
the 
power 
of 
the 
Kingdom 
I 
agree 
They 
ll 
convert 
to 
Christianity 
And 
there 
arose 
on 
that 
day 
a 
great 
persecution 
against 
the 
church 
in 
Jerusalem 
and 
they 
were 
all 
scattered 
throughout 
the 
regions 
of 
Judea 
and 
Samaria 
except 
the 
apostles 
So 
the 
Philip 
described 
in 
Acts 
is 
not 
the 
Apostle 
Philip 
but 
someone 
else 
He 
brought

BTW 
do 
you 
abandon 
for 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
Anglican 
translation 
or 
have 
you 
never 
thought 
about 
that 
yet 
And 
what 
makes 
their 
translation 
God 
breathed 
Did 
Jesus 
point 
to 
it 
Did 
Jesus 
say 
do 
you 
see 
those 
futuristic 
stones 
No 
he 
was 
referring 
to 
the 
second 
temple 
that 
existed 
at 
that 
time 
He 
said 
it 
would 
be 
destroyed 
He 
said 
a 
bunch 
of 
stuff 
would 
happen 
prior 
to 
that 
destruction 
It 
s 
what 
Matthew 
is 
about 
Okay 
getting 
over 
acute 
bronchitis 
but 
praise 
God 
for 
antibiotics 
for 
people 
with 
penicillin 
allergies 
It 
s 
good 
news 
to 
you 
To 
them 
hearing 
the 
good 
news 
is 
heaping 
coals 
on 
their 
head 
I 
don 
t 
even 
think 
you 
know 
what 
that 
word 
means 
I 
doubt 
you 
could 
tell 
the 
differences 
between 
the 
various 
camps 
or 
could 
identify 
where 
I 
fit 
into 
those 
divisions 
It 
s 
absurd 
to 
come 
up 
with 
your 
man 
made 
theology 
that 
makes 
everything 
future 
because 
you 
don 
t 
know 
how 
to 
read 
scripture 
It 
s 
a 
problem 
Did 
my 
above 
explanation 
not 
cut 
it 
What 
does 
Jesus 
reading 
scripture 
have 
anything 
to 
do 
with 
an 
English 
translation 
Both 
have 
occurred 
Where 
s 
the 
second 
Temple 
that 
Jesus 
pointed 
to 
I 
thought 
we 
were 
talking 
about 
Matthew 
Every 
try 
to 
share 
the 
good 
news 
with 
people 
and 
they 
they 
tell 
you 
to 
shut 
up 
No 
but 
I 
m 
not 
a 
I 
m 
glad 
human 
beings 
came 
up 
with 
a 
man 
made 
word 
to 
describe 
an 
eternal 
truth 
God 
fulfilling 
His 
prophecies 
in 
the 
time 
frame 
He 
specified 
is 
not 
absurd 
You 
re 
just 
super 
attached 
to 
your 
man 
made 
recently 
invented 
theology 
You 
think 
God 
fulfilling 
His 
prophecies 
is 
absurd 
The 
generation 
that 
saw 
the 
collapse 
of 
the 
second 
temple 
yes 
If 
you 
want 
to 
understand 
a 
lot 
of 
the 
odd 
stuff 
in 
Ezekiel 
You 
re 
going 
to 
have 
to 
turn 
to 
history 
books 
but 
if 
you 
don 
t 
want 
to 
do 
that 
a 
lot 
of 
the 
clues 
can 
be 
found 
in 
Book 
of 
Esther 
The 
battle 
of 
Gog 
and 
Magog 
already 
happened 
St 
John 
was 
referring 
to 
it 
figuratively 
in 
the 
way 
that 
Babylon 
did 
not 
literally 
mean 
the 
collapsed 
Babylonian 
empire 
He 
gave 
that 
to 
the 
apostles 
as 
well 
The 
Gospel 
is 
good 
news 
for 
the 
elect 
that 
the 
second 
person 
of 
the 
trinity 
became 
incarnate 
to 
fulfill 
the 
law 
and 
the 
prophets 
pronounce 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
God 
declare 
war 
on 
Satan 
and 
provide 
the 
blood 
for 
the 
restoration 
of 
communion 
with 
God 
to 
fallen 
humanity 
everywhere 
is 
man 
made 
The 
Great 
Tribulation 
already 
happened 
to 
the 
generation 
that 
Jesus 
singled 
out 
as 
the 
most 
wicked 
demon 
infest 
generation 
to 
have 
ever 
existed 
The 
same 
generation 
that 
said 
let 
his 
blood 
be 
on 
us 
Thank 
you 
for 
taking 
the 
time 
to 
share 
your 
position 
but 
I 
am 
familiar 
with 
the 
gist 
of 
it 
and 
I 
wholeheartedly 
reject 
it 
You 
can 
obviously 
read 
but 
you 
don 
t 
know 
how 
to 
properly 
read 
especially 
prophetic 
texts 
because 
you 
do 
not 
treat 
them 
as 
special 
types 
Truly 
I 
say 
to 
you 
this 
generation 
will 
not 
pass 
away 
until 
all 
these 
things 
take 
place 
At 
hand 
means 
years 
later 
it 
means 
close 
in 
time 
about 
to 
happen 
radically 
misconstrues 
the 
typological 
structure 
of 
the 
old 
and 
new 
covenants 
reducing 
typology 
to 
m 
God 
sends 
lying 
spirits 
to 
deceive 
false 
prophets 
for 
their 
sins 
Who 
created 
the 
confusion 
of 
different 
languages 
at 
Babel 
I 
m 
referring 
to 
Luke 
The 
Pharisees 
show 
up 
and 
start 
acting 
like 
haters 
so 
Jesus 
tells 
the 
Parable 
of 
the 
Lost 
Sheep 
then 
the 
Parable 
of 
the 
Lost 
Coin 
and 
then 
the 
Parable 
of 
the 
Prodigal 
Son 
Well 
the 
point 
of 
the 
parables 
was 
to 
confuse 
the 
lost 
people 
when 
Jesus 
spoke 
in 
front 
of 
large 
groups 
Jesus 
begins 
a 
set 
of 
sermons 
in 
which 
only 
the 
first 
was 
called 
a 
parable 
but 
the 
others 
were 
clearly 
in 
that 
format 
as 
well 
The 
Parable 
of 
the 
Great 
Banquet 
in 
Luke 
t 
call 
itself 
a 
parable 
but 
the 
parallel 
in 
Matthew 
calls 
itself 
a 
parable 
Does 
this 
create 
a 
problem 
for 
the 
method 
So 
if 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
parables 
was 
to 
conceal 
a 
deeper 
message 
from 
those 
on 
the 
outside 
would 
those 
on 
the 
outside 
have 
understood 
the 
Prodigal 
Son 
What 
was 
the 
point 
If 
this 
is 
not 
allegorical 
what 
is 
the 
point 
Jesus 
is 
just 
getting 
up 
before 
people 
and 
announcing 
some 
odd 
current 
events 
of 
the 
time 
for 
no 
real 
reason 
How 
much 
clearer 
does 
he 
have 
to 
be 
The 
Parable 
of 
the 
Great 
Banquet 
is 
a 
parable 
It 
has 
all 
of 
the 
elements 
of 
a 
parable 
Jesus 
trusts 
that 
you 
to 
have 
the 
brain 
cells 
to 
realize 
it 
with 
out 
it 
being 
spelled 
out 
for 
you 
like 
a 
child 
In 
Luke 
Jesus 
did 
not 
announce 
that 
he 
was 
telling 
a 
parable 
when 
he 
told 
the 
Parable 
of 
the 
Prodigal 
Son 
Was 
that 
not 
a 
parable 
In 
Luke 
Jesus 
did 
not 
call 
The 
Parable 
of 
the 
Great 
Banquet 
a 
parable 
Do 
you 
think 
it 
t 
a 
parable 
He 
did 
not 
say 
the 
Good 
Samaritan 
was 
a 
parable 
Do 
you 
deny 
that 
it 
was 
a 
parable 
based 
simply 
on 
the 
fact 
that 
Jesus 
did 
not 
spell 
it 
out 
for 
you 
I 
don 
t 
think 
he 
understands 
death 
in 
a 
non 
hyper 
literal 
sense 
To 
speak 
in 
any 
other 
way 
is 
to 
engage 
in 
allegory 
and 
he 
t 
believe 
in 
that 
I 
don 
t 
think 
he 
believes 
in 
interpreting 
parables 
as 
parables 
either 
Wolverine 
YIKES 
But 
that 
means 
you 
just 
twisted 
the 
meaning 
of 
my 
tweet 
You 
guys 
do 
that 
with 
scripture 
too 
Too 
harsh 
Listen 
I 
m 
not 
going 
doubt 
the 
salvation 
of 
the 
guys 
who 
think 
they 
see 
Apache 
helicopters 
in 
the 
Bible 
but 
I 
will 
suggest 
that 
the 
Spirit 
t 
keep 
you 
from 
going 
down 
weird 
rabbit 
holes 
Let 
s 
be 
real 
Thinking 
like 
an 
ancient 
Israelite 
after 
being 
so 
conditioned 
by 
modernism 
and 
and 
rationalism 
etc 
etc 
does 
not 
come 
naturally 
to 
us 
The 
writers 
and 
the 
audiences 
had 
knowledge 
that 
you 
as 
a 
st 
century 
westerner 
brought 
up 
on 
modernist 
assumptions 
simply 
don 
t 
have 
You 
need 
to 
learn 
to 
think 
like 
them 
to 
proper 
understand 
them 
That 
s 
the 
problem 
with 
you 
guys 
you 
can 
t 
spot 
symbolism 
when 
it 
is

Culturally 
speaking

generally

might

particular 
cultural 
generation 
All 
of 
my 
WWII 
era 
working 
class 
relatives 
were 
not 
particularly 
big 
on 
public 
grieving 
It 
was 
actually 
taboo 
It 
t 
be 
smart 
to 
go 
up 
to 
someone 
in 
the 
anger 
stage 
of 
grief 
and 
say 
accept 
that 
this 
is 
God 
s 
will 
or 
else 
you 
re 
an 
open 
theist 
heretic 
It 
is 
a 
product 
of 
wisdom 
Bad 
things 
happen 
Even 
secular 
psychologists 
believe 
that 
the 
final 
stage 
of 
the 
grieving 
process 
is 
acceptance 
I 
don 
t 
know 
what 
the 
secularist 
bases 
that 
acceptance 
on 
but 
as 
Christians 
we 
have 
God 
s 
sovereignty 
This 
is 
seems 
to 
be 
more 
of 
a 
pastoral 
issue 
which 
might 
vary 
from 
person 
to 
person 
and 
issue 
to

Some 
people 
hear

Some

I 
m 
asking 
about 
the 
words 
Where 
is 
rapture

Where 
is 
second 
coming 
found 
Where 
does 
Christ 
touching 
his 
foot 
down 
on 
the 
Mount 
of 
Olives 
found 
I 
m 
asking 
about 
the 
literal 
years 
The 
reason 
I 
ask 
is 
because 
you 
re 
making 
a 
huge 
system 
based 
off 
of 
a 
super 
interpretation 
of 
a 
single 
verse 
from 
the 
most 
non 
literal 
books 
of 
the 
Bible 
I 
m 
curious 
do 
you 
have 
another 
biblical 
witness 
to 
back 
it 
up 
Is 
that 
the 
only 
verse 
Where 
does 
it 
say 
years 
Did 
you 
keep 
reading 
after 
verse 
The 
throne 
is 
next 
to 
the 
Father 
In 
your 
King 
James 
is 
there 
actually 
a 
second 
coming 
in 
those 
exact 
words 
Paul 
was 
arguing 
that 
they 
t 
torture 
him 
prior 
to 
a 
conviction 
according 
to 
God 
s 
Law 
because 
yeah 
God 
likes 
justice 
So 
they 
were 
Trinitarians 
who 
taught 
propitiatory 
atonement 
but 
they 
were 
not 
Christians 
Baptism 
in 
the 
name 
of 
Israel 
So 
they 
were 
preaching 
an 
executed 
with 
no 
mention 
of 
the 
resurrection 
But 
did 
he 
use 
the 
exact 
same 
word 
for 
word 
wording 
as 
Paul 
Unless 
it 
is 
a 
historical 
drama

not 
apply 
Trees

And 
he 
Jesus 
went

in

synagogues

kingdom 
and

disease 
and

Earlier 
than 
Acts 
Try 
Mark 
during 
his 
earthly 
ministry 
He 
is 
on 
the 
throne 
now 
Did 
Christ 
declare 
all 
food 
to 
be 
clean 
or 
was 
that 
Peter 
or 
Paul 
or 
the 
counsel 
of 
Jerusalem 
Of 
course 
he 
was 
as 
an 
infant 
Circumcision 
was 
a 
sign 
of 
entry 
into 
the 
administration 
of 
the 
older 
covenant 
but 
the 
cross 
REPLACED 
that 
blood 
sign 
with 
water 
and 
spirit 
The 
administration 
changed 
Christ 
was 
not 
going 
around 
circumcising 
people 
or 
demanding 
that 
from 
anyone 
It 
was 
a 
sign 
of 
the 
older 
covenant 
Here 
is 
part 
the 
confusion 
during 
the 
phase 
the 
Pharisees 
started 
adding 
a 
bunch 
of 
crazy 
stuff 
to 
the 
law 
and 
when 
Paul 
spoke 
of 
the 
law 
he 
did 
not 
always 
announce 
whether 
he 
meant 
the 
law 
or 
the 
tradition 
Huh 
that 
is 
weird 
right 
It 
is 
almost 
like 
Christians 
are 
still 
expected 
to 
keep 
that 
one 
Apostle 
Paul 
pro 
idol 
worship 
Pro 
theft 
Pro 
murder 
Pro 
worshiping 
other 
gods 
Pro 
false 
witness 
So 
the 
Apostle 
Paul 
pro 
honoring 
parents 
or 
pro 
dishonoring 
parents 
So 
what 
law 
do 
you 
not 
follow 
SO 
the 
bible 
is 
filled 
with 
contradictions 
and 
truth 
is 
relative 
Did 
you 
learn 
your 
bible 
studies 
from 
an 
atheist 
So 
you 
believe 
they 
are 
contradictions 
Do 
you 
think 
Paul 
s 
message 
contradicted 
Christ 
s 
message 
And 
the 
ones 
that 
t 
in 
Christ 
are 
vessels 
of 
wrath 
You 
cannot 
submit 
your 
results 
in 
the 
after 
life 
No 
there 
is 
They 
are 
in 
my 
family 
Chosen 
for 
what 
The 
vast 
majority 
that 
I 
know 
are 
atheists 
They 
will 
share 
the 
same 
fate 
as 
the 
Chinese 
atheist 
and 
the 
Roman 
atheist 
and 
the 
British 
atheist

hating

I 
cannot

how 
much 
I 
appreciate 
the 
dialogue 
It 
has 
been 
food 
for 
thought 
It

a 
Stoic 
concept 
Would 
Moses

spoken 
about 
Any 
of 
the 
prophets 
Can 
it 
be 
taken 
as

a

appropriation 
for

What 
if 
Paul

to

Should 
we

from

uncritically

am

familiar 
with 
name 
in 
that 
group 
It 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
code 
for 
liberal 
almost 
revolutionary 
and 
what 
little 
I 
know 
about 
is 
antithetical 
to 
that 
My 
concern 
is 
that 
because 
we 
have 
what 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
polemical 
allusion 
by 
Paul 
to 
does 
that

synthesis 
More 
as 
a 
product

the 
history

The 
fact 
that 
people 
cannot 
agree 
about 
what 
it 
actually 
constitutes 
outside 
of 
Christian 
assumptions 
points 
to 
it 
being 
a 
product 
of 
The 
Stoics 
spoke 
of 
it 
Paul 
seems 
to 
allude 
to 
it 
but 
he 
considered 
their 
thinking 
futile 
I 
suppose 
it 
depends 
on 
how 
much 
the 
truth 
is 
suppressed 
and 
how 
much 
they 
have 
become 
futile 
in 
their 
thinking 
Natural 
law 
seems 
like 
a 
fine 
concept 
in 
a 
Christian 
society 
with 
similar 
cultural 
assumptions 
which 
can 
be 
taken 
as 
natural 
but 
look 
at 
historical 
anthropology 
what 
is 
considered 
natural 
varies 
more 
than 
drastically

I 
am

new 
convert 
so 
I 
do 
not 
mean 
to 
sound 
like 
an 
expert 
but 
my 
takeaway 
was 
that 
natural 
law 
was 
predicated 
on 
neutrality 
which 
Van 
seemed 
to 
have 
called 
into 
serious 
question 
I 
came 
to 
Christianity 
from 
a 
background 
and 
the 
made 
a 
convincing 
case 
about 
the 
inability 
to 
know 
anything 
based 
on 
anything 
including 
natural 
law 
Van 
provides 
an 
answer 
for 
a 
positive 
epistemology 
I 
thought 
Van 
and 
the 
destroyed 
that 
concept 
beyond 
repair 
A 
Christian 
has 
a 
different 
understanding 
of

to 
the

overreaction 
among 
many 
orthodox 
Christians 
to 
the 
social

I 
only 
been 
a 
Christian 
for 
a 
little 
over 
a 
year 
but 
I 
dove 
into 
the 
writings 
From 
what 
I 
gathered 
the 
laissez 
attitude 
towards 
things 
outside 
the 
church 
is 
not 
classic 
reformed 
thought 
Wow 
that 
was 
escalated 
quickly 
I 
was 
not

I 
was 
talking 
about

I 
raised 
the 
question 
Did 
Puritan 
theology 
have 
an 
impact 
on 
their 
attitudes 
towards 
labor 
commerce 
politics 
arts 
family 
etc 
or 
was 
their 
faith 
hermetically 
sealed 
If 
the 
Puritans 
were 
into 
making 
diagrams 
how 
different 
would 
their 
diagram 
be 
from 
the 
above 
diagram 
They

I 
found 
it 
necessary 
to 
write 
appealing 
to 
you 
to 
contend 
for 
the 
faith 
that 
was 
once 
for 
all 
delivered 
to 
the 
saints 
Because 
nobody 
is 
writing 
scripture 
today 
That 
s 
not 
what 
I 
m 
saying 
The 
spirit 
is 
present 
in 
all 
believers 
but 
that 
t 
mean 
that 
we 
have 
Jedi 
powers 
I 
gave 
you 
the 
scriptural 
proof 
of 
Paul 
saying 
they 
would 
pass 
Accusing 
the 
early 
church 
of 
Antisemitism 
without 
any 
proof 
I 
might 
add 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
prove 
your 
case 
that 
talking 
today 
is 
a 
miracle 
I 
suppose 
if 
you 
replaced 
the 
concept 
of 
righteousness 
with 
the 
concept 
of 
equality 
as 
defined 
by 
secular 
humanists 
The 
cardinal 
principle 
of 
unbelief 
is 
that 
miracles 
have 
never 
happened

co

So 
that 
means 
he 
basically 
tossed 
out 
God 
s 
Law 
as 
the 
standard 
for 
justice 
and 
substituted 
his 
own 
political 
ideology 
in 
its 
place 
It 
s 
quite 
something 
to 
behold 
It 
s 
generic 
leftism 
dressed 
up 
in 
verbiage 
In 
a 
follow 
up 
Tweet 
he 
gives 
a 
specific 
example 
of 
the 
just 
preach 
the 
gospel 
Christians 
it 
was 
an 
group 
who 
t 
calling 
for 
just 
preaching 
the 
gospel 
they 
were 
calling 
for 
Mosaic 
Law 
They 
had 
to 
worship 
YAHWEH 
in 
the 
way 
prescribed 
They 
had 
to 
live 
by 
the 
Old 
Covenant 
They 
t 
change 
their 
DNA 
or 
join 
a 
tribe 
and 
if 
they 
wanted 
to 
reject 
the 
Pharisees 
incorrect 
interpretations 
of 
the 
law 
then 
that 
would 
be 
fine 
as 
well 
I 
believe 
that 
people 
are 
not 
being 
inspired 
with 
special 
revelation 
in 
the 
ways 
they 
were 
when 
scripture 
was 
being 
written 
Did 
you 
get 
a 
prophecy 
about 
that 
from 
your 
imagination 
If 
revelation 
t 
stop 
there 
would 
be 
more 
scripture 
So 
in 
his 
vision 
people 
should 
focus 
on 
fighting 
inequality 
without 
exerting 
much 
emphasis 
on 
spreading 
the 
gospel 
and 
certainly 
not 
investing 
any 
efforts 
on 
reducing 
clearly 
defined 
immorality 
It 
sounds 
like 
generic 
liberalism 
dressed 
up 
in 
verbiage 
So 
if 
I 
understand 
this 
correctly 
means 
people 
who 
just 
want 
to 
preach 
the 
gospel 
and 
make 
no 
social 
change 
as 
well 
as 
people 
who 
want 
to 
crush 
social 
evil 
on 
earth 
in 
a 
way 
described 
in 
God 
s 
Law 
Is 
the 
problem 
their 
understanding 
of 
kingdom 
t 
equal 
his 
politics 
He 
called 
a 
truncated 
view 
that 
focuses 
solely 
on 
gospel 
spreading 
rather 
than 
fighting 
evil 
Well 
in 
a 
subsequent 
tweet 
he 
gave 
a 
specific 
example 
of 
an 
who 
t 
talking 
about 
just 
gospel 
preaching 
guy 
wanted 
Mosaic 
capital 
offense 
laws 
This 
is 
confusing 
For 
other 
people 
who 
were 
not 
as 
invested 
in 
hating 
God 
as 
I 
was 
this 
process 
can 
happen 
pretty 
quickly 
It 
could 
be 
something 
as 
simple 
as 
turning 
to 
a 
Christian 
radio 
channel 
that 
you 
normally 
skip 
over 
but 
because 
of 
regeneration 
you 
become 
intrigued 
and 
hungry 
I 
ll 
give 
an 
example 
from 
my 
case 
I 
openly 
hated 
God 
with 
a 
passion 
but 
unbeknown 
to 
me 
I 
was 
regenerated 
and 
my 
heart 
started 
to 
soften 
and 
become 
alive 
I 
went 
from 
I 
hate 
God 
to 
maybe 
I 
been 
wrong 
but 
probably 
not 
to 
I 
was 
very 
very 
wrong 
to 
God 
is 
great 
etc 
We 
define 
regeneration 
as 
the 
means 
by 
which 
a 
person 
goes 
from 
a 
state 
of 
hating 
God 
to 
a 
state 
of 
loving 
God 
and 
proclaiming 
faith 
Regeneration 
is 
very 
subtle 
and 
subconscious 
Most 
people 
don 
t 
even 
realize 
it 
is 
happening 
to 
them 
I 
think 
I 
understand 
where 
things 
are 
getting 
confusing 
Quite 
often 
people 
mistake 
regeneration 
with 
sanctification 
They 
t 
the 
same 
thing 
Don 
t 
get 
me 
wrong 
I 
get 
a 
perverse 
guilty 
pleasure 
from 
messing 
with 
for 
embarrassing 
my 
faith 
but 
it 
raises 
questions 
by 
what 
standard 
do 
we 
as 
covenant 
people 
define 
evil 
Is 
it 
a 
social 
construct 
Is 
it 
natural 
law 
Is 
it 
from 
special 
revelation 
Can 
we 
truncate 
I 
m 
confused 
I 
thought 
your 
critique 
of 
was 
that 
it 
neglected 
our 
responsibility 
that 
evil 
needs 
to 
be 
purged 
for 
a 
cosmic 
redemptive 
hope 
for 
the 
new 
earth

of 
the

nobody 
in

says 
the

Based 
on 
the 
absence 
of 
mentioning 
that 
colossal 
event 
we 
assume 
scripture 
was 
complete 
before 
that 
event

Everywhere 
in

signs 
and 
wonders 
were 
for 
the 
era 
of 
new 
revelation 
When 
revelation 
stops 
there 
can 
t 
be 
a 
divine 
revelation 
announcing 
that 
the

revelation 
had 
stopped

that

THOUGHT 
THE 
GIFTS 
WERE 
STILL 
CONTINUING 
WHAT 
AUGUSTINE 
THOUGHT 
WAS 
THE 
SAME 
AS 
EVERYONE 
ELSE 
In 
the 
earliest 
times 
the 
Holy 
Spirit 
fell 
upon 
them 
that 
believe 
and 
they 
spoke 
with 
tongues 
which 
they 
had 
not 
learned 
as 
the 
Spirit 
gave 
them 
utterance 
These 
were 
signs 
adapted 
to 
the 
time 
That 
thing 
was 
done 
for 
a 
sign 
and 
it 
passed 
away 
Augustine 
This 
whole 
place 
is 
very 
obscure 
but 
the 
obscurity 
is 
produced 
by 
our 
ignorance 
of 
the 
facts 
referred 
to 
and 
by 
their 
cessation 
being 
such 
as 
then 
used

a 
to 
save 
you 
That 
s 
because 
it

from 
liberal

Scripture 
along 
with 
God 
s 
providence 
in 
history 
is 
all 
we 
needed 
How 
could 
someone 
write 
scripture 
after 
the 
closing 
of 
the 
era 
announcing 
that 
the 
era 
had 
closed 
I 
said 
by 
AD 
because 
that 
s 
when 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
canon 
of 
scripture 
was 
closed 
and 
the 
critical 
era 
of 
revelation 
history 
had 
closed 
Early 
churchmen 
also 
believed 
that 
those 
signs 
had 
ceased 
I 
m 
sorry 
but 
you 
need 
to 
understand 
biblical 
theology 
Signs 
and 
wonders 
only 
happen 
during 
critical 
eras 
of 
revelation 
history 
That 
s 
how 
it 
always 
happened 
Paul 
knew 
that 
as 
well 
He 
knew 
the 
critical 
era 
was 
ending 
It 
ends 
when 
nobody 
is 
doing 
it 
anymore 
with 
any 
legitimacy 
I 
would 
say 
by 
AD 
In 
other 
words 
what 
is 
going 
on 
today 
with 
people 
claiming 
to 
speak 
in 
tongues 
and 
give 
prophecies 
is 
essentially 
blasphemous 
Please 
stop 
Love 
never 
ends 
As 
for 
prophecies 
they 
will 
pass 
away 
as 
for

they 
will

as 
for 
knowledge 
it 
will

Corinthians 
Please 
understand 
me 
It 
s 
not 
the 
gift 
of 
the 
spirit 
The 
apostles 
t 
playing 
make 
believe 
They 
were 
talking 
real 
languages 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
their 
authority 
from 
God 
The 
gentiles 
received 
it 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
the 
covenant 
extending 
to 
them 
too 
That 
s 
the 
point 
of 
all 
this 
I 
do 
not 
deny 
scripture 
Do 
you 
know 
what 
the 
scriptural 
punishment 
is 
for 
going 
around 
doing 
fake 
miracles 
and 
making 
false 
prophecies 
It 
s 
not 
irrelevant 
They 
thought 
they 
had 
the 
gift 
but 
it 
turns 
out 
they 
were 
deceiving 
themselves 
with 
spiritual 
pride 
of 
being 
gifted 
It 
s 
a 
hoax 
The 
period 
of 
those 
gifts 
is 
over 
It 
s 
not 
irrelevant 
Like 
I 
said 
anyone 
can 
do 
it 
You 
just 
have 
to 
allow 
yourself 
to 
act 
foolishly 
I 
m 
not 
denying 
scripture 
I 
believe 
your 
movement 
has 
redefined 
people 
talking 
in 
other 
real 
understandable 
translatable 
languages 
into 
talking 
talk 
did 
you 
hear 
about 
all 
the 
Pentecostals 
who 
went 
to 
Africa 
and 
thought 
their 
tongues 
were 
real 
so 
they 
t 
need 
to 
learn 
the 
local 
language 
and 
basically 
humiliated 
themselves 
horribly 
Most 
of 
the 
homeless 
in 
my 
neighborhood 
must 
be 
super 
spiritual 
then 
They 
talk 
gibberish 
all 
the 
time 
and 
I 
even 
heard 
a 
few 
prophecies 
Gibberish 
t 
a 
gift 
Anyone 
can 
do 
it 
Some 
of 
us 
are 
not 
going 
to 
deceive 
ourselves 
into 
thinking 
it 
has 
anything 
to 
do 
with 
God 
Scripture 
forbids 
babble 
So 
the 
key 
to 
talking 
nonsense 
is 
to 
think 
you 
got 
a 
gift 
that 
you 
don 
t 
have 
so 
it 
can 
t 
be 
nonsense 
Okay 
I 
am 
beginning 
to 
understand 
I 
agree 
what 
these 
people 
are 
doing 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
scripture 
I 
m 
suggesting 
that 
what 
happened 
to 
them 
was 
from 
God 
Talking 
nonsense 
is 
to 
feel 
spiritual 
when 
you 
re 
not 
I 
got 
the 
whole 
world 
wide 
at 
my 
disposal 
and 
I 
never 
seen 
anyone 
not 
look 
insane 
or 
pathetic 
when 
they 
are 
talking 
in 
tongues 
I 
m 
not 
an 
apostle 
I 
don 
t 
have 
those 
gifts 
and 
neither 
do 
you 
because 
if 
you 
did 
then 
you 
are 
being 
selfing 
typing 
away 
on 
twitter 
instead 
of 
healing 
all 
the 
kids 
in 
the 
cancer 
ward 
From 
what 
I 
can 
discern 
I 
see 
fakers 
at 
best 
people 
plagued 
with 
demons 
at 
worst 
The 
apostles 
were 
under 
educated 
guys 
from 
Galilee 
speaking 
languages 
they 
t 
know 
so 
unbelievers 
would 
be 
in 
marvel 
What 
goes 
on 
today 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
that 
You 
see 
apostles 
going 
around 
healing 
people 
super 
easy 
to 
not 
being 
able 
to 
do 
anything 
for 
sick 
people 
but 
pray 
for 
them 
The 
signs 
were 
for 
the 
season 
of 
the 
new

They 
would

an 
unbeliever 
All 
this 
rests 
on 
the 
fact 
that 
you 
re 
not 
doing 
something 
asinine 
Now 
we 
re 
getting 
somewhere 
Do 
you 
think 
Paul 
equated 
pointless 
babble 
with 
speaking 
in 
tongues 
I 
restrict 
meaningless 
babble 
from 
my 
prayer 
life 
and 
so 
should 
you 
He 
also 
says 
Thus 
tongues 
are 
a 
sign 
not 
for 
believers 
but 
for 
unbelievers 
If 
therefore 
the 
whole 
church 
comes 
together 
and 
all 
speak 
in 
tongues 
and 
outsiders 
or 
unbelievers 
enter 
will 
they 
not 
say 
that 
you 
are 
out 
of 
your 
minds 
Jesus 
said 
pray 
LIKE 
THIS 
Meaning 
that 
it 
is 
a 
good 
model 
for 
prayer 
life 
Give 
honor 
to 
His 
transcendence 
and 
power 
Express 
thanks 
Ask 
for 
protection 
These 
things 
can 
be 
personalized 
for 
you 
but 
notice 
before 
this 
he 
says 
don 
t 
babble 
Paul 
t 
referring 
to 
milk 
as 
a 
basic 
necessity 
He 
was 
referring 
to 
milk 
as 
something 
babies 
sip 
before 
they 
grow 
up 
and 
start 
eating 
solid 
food 
Paul 
expected 
them 
to 
grow 
up 
The 
NT 
was 
a 
new 
revelation 
What 
does 
scripture 
say 
Jesus 
said 
to 
pray 
like 
this 
Our 
Father 
in 
heaven 
hallowed 
be 
your 
name 
Your 
kingdom 
come 
your 
will 
be 
done 
on 
earth 
as 
it 
is 
in 
heaven 
not 
like 
Moses 
came 
with 
a 
new 
revelation 
and 
he 
performed 
signs 
Jesus 
came 
with 
a 
new 
revelation 
and 
he 
performed 
signs 
The 
apostles 
brought 
that 
new 
revelation 
and 
they 
performed 
signs 
Did 
you 
notice 
the 
number 
of 
signs 
dropping 
as 
the 
NT 
proceeded 
Scripture 
t 
really 
speak 
of 
miracles 
in 
the 
originals 
It 
speaks 
of 
signs 
wonders 
and 
marvelous 
works 
These 
signs 
are 
actually 
pretty 
rare 
in 
scripture 
They 
come 
at 
times 
of 
new 
revelation 
to 
establish 
authority 
in 
the 
early 
stage 
of 
the 
revelation 
You 
re 
not 
an 
angel 
You 
don 
t 
know 
angelic 
languages 
The 
only 
benefit 
you 
re 
getting 
is 
a 
lung 
exercise 
God 
t 
want 
to 
hear 
meaningless 
drivel 
What 
does 
babble 
have 
to 
do 
with 
truth 
You 
think 
God 
wants 
to 
hear 
babble 
Does 
this 
look 
like 
a 
miracle 
to 
you 
If 
you 
were 
an 
unbeliever 
would 
this 
blow 
your 
mind 
and 
bring 
you 
to 
faith 
Or 
perhaps 
these 
people 
are 
playing 
make 
believe 
t 
co 
Et 
s 
Private 
intercession 
to 
who 
Paul 
says 
it 
t 
be 
a 
noisy 
gong 
or 
a 
clanging 
cymbal 
It 
should 
be 
able 
to 
be 
interpreted 
It 
should 
be 
a 
miracle 
not 
something 
a 
baby 
can 
do 
These 
people 
doing 
this 
sort 
of 
stuff 
today 
are 
not 
honoring 
God 
or 
giving 
Him 
proper 
worship 
They 
are 
acting 
like 
fools 
What 
does 
angel 
mean 
It 
means 
messenger 
What 
kind 
of 
messenger 
runs 
up 
to 
your 
door 
knocks 
on 
it 
and 
when 
you 
open 
the 
door 
says 
Jesus 
said 
And 
when 
you 
pray 
do 
not 
heap 
up 
empty 
phrases 
as 
the 
Gentiles 
do 
for 
they 
think 
that 
they 
will 
be 
heard 
for 
their 
many 
words 
Do 
not 
be 
like 
them 
for 
your 
Father 
knows 
what 
you 
need 
before 
you 
ask 
him 
If 
that 
answer 
t 
good 
enough 
could 
you 
please 
articulate 
what 
you 
re 
saying 
I 
don 
t 
consider 
people 
babbling 
nonsense 
to 
be 
a 
spiritual 
gift 
What 
are 
stars 
literally 
We 
are 
to 
love 
and 
be 
patient 
with 
the 
church 
all 
her 
faults 
and 
failures 
notwithstanding 
knowing 
that 
we 
ourselves 
belong 
While 
the 
idea 
captures 
the 
nostalgia 
of 
many 
it 
is 
actually 
a 
very 
misguided 
notion 
that 
Christians 
should 
oppose 
Gen 
announced 
that 
mankind 
would 
be 
divided 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
separation 
of 
a 
people 
of 
God 
from 
the 
people 
of 
the 
Restless 
Heart

Confessions 
of 
Augustine

I 
thought 
it

I 
have 
noticed 
varies 
from 
local 
to 
local 
There 
are 
in 
my 
county 
Each 
one 
has 
its 
own 
flavor 
I 
figured 
it 
t 
unique 
to 
here 
or 
the 
I 
know 
congregations 
way 
more 
conservative 
than 
some 
congregations 
Reformed 
Episcopal 
Church 
I 
been 
on 
five 
continents 
and 
several 
countries 
How 
does 
that 
work 
Yep 
I 
should 
also 
mention 
that 
the 
who 
is 
openly 
was 
the 
first 
to 
jump 
into 
action 
about 
the 
Fed 
Vis 
controversy 
stating 
the 
Westminster 
standards 
and 
calling 
for 
repentance 
It 
was 
swift 
It 
was 
on 
point 
It 
t 
mixed 
up 
with 
a 
bunch 
of 
other 
baggage 
It 
is 
stuff 
like 
this 
that 
inspired 
my 
original 
comment 
that 
I 
suspect 
that 
if 
the 
people 
involved 
in 
the 
drama 
were 
good 
apathetic 
there 
would 
have 
been 
a 
calm 
charitable 
discussion 
rather 
than 
a 
freak 
out 
As 
one 
k 
critic 
in 
explained 
Federal 
Vision 
is 
the 
natural 
progression 
of 
the 
principles 
of 
That 
is 
why 
many 
the 
st 
generation 
federal 
are 
and 
and 
the 
Federal 
Vision 
are 
not 
identical 
but 
they 
are 
twins 
As 
I 
understand 
it 
things 
went 
nuts 
in 
the 
The 
Billy 
Graham 
type 
evangelicals 
freaked 
out 
over 
a 
higher 
view 
of 
the 
sacraments 
and 
elitism 
The 
K 
freaked 
out 
because 
they 
equated 
as 
the 
new 
face 
of 
their 
true 
enemy 
not 
the 
secular 
humanists 
No

The 
did 
not 
spin 
out 
of 
control 
over 
It 
was 
determined 
that 
the 
and 
New 
Perspective 
on 
Paul 
had 
some 
very 
valid 
points 
to 
make 
although 
aberrant 
views 
on 
justification 
have 
been 
promulgated 
from 
within 
these 
circles 
That 
probably 
points 
to 
my 
ignorance 
of 
what 
happened 
It 
might 
explain 
the 
hesitance 
to 
engage 
in 
another 
probably 
bigger 
fight 
For 
my 
part 
I 
probably 
cut 
some 
of 
the 
crowd 
extra 
slack 
because 
I 
really 
like 
some 
of 
their 
thought 
provoking 
work 
on 
typology 
Like 
I 
said 
I 
m 
a 
new 
convert 
so 
that 
has 
certain 
downsides 
ignorance 
and 
certain 
insights 
fresh 
eyes 
and 
I 
can 
t 
help 
but 
notice 
what 
gets 
people 
institutionally 
riled 
up 
and 
what 
t 
What 
would 
you 
find 
if 
you 
really 
looked 
at 
the 
woke 
view 
of 
justification 
I 
read 
the 
report 
If 
I 
recall 
correctly 
it 
got 
much 
more 
heated 
in 
the 
so 
I 
might 
check 
that 
out 
but 
my 
suspicion 
has 
not 
been 
that 
it 
was 
overtly 
about 
which 
has 
been 
deemed 
a 
legit 
view 
Thus 
people 
don 
t 
go 
after 
each 
other 
explicitly 
on 
those 
grounds 
One 
more 
clarification 
Let 
s 
imagine 
that 
Van 
was 
I 
m 
not 
saying 
that 
people 
would 
have 
gone 
after 
Van 
for 
being 
I 
m 
saying 
that 
if 
Van 
was 
they 
would 
have 
gone 
after 
him 
for 
his 
idiosyncratic 
articulation 
of 
the 
Trinity 
I 
m 
a 
recent 
convert 
and 
I 
could 
totally 
be 
misreading 
the 
situation 
but 
I 
can 
t 
help 
but 
notice 
that 
the 
slow 
moving 
institutions 
don 
t 
ever 
get 
into 
gear 
unless 
a 
theologically 
conservative 
says 
something 
incorrect 
real 
or 
imagined 
Lesbian 
woke 
warriors 
are 
cool 
tho 
I 
m 
going 
to 
suggest 
something 
a 
controversial 
but 
I 
suspect 
that 
if 
the 
people 
involved 
in 
the 
drama 
were 
good 
apathetic 
there 
would 
have 
been 
a 
calm 
charitable 
discussion 
rather 
than 
a 
freak 
out 
get 
up 
in 
arms 
when 
target 
their 
apathy 
This 
is 
really 
sick 
and 
disturbing 
They 
re 
calling 
it 
sacred 
work 
The 
god 
they 
worship 
sure 
t 
our 
Heavenly 
Father 
The 
Revelation 
can 
only 
be 
understood 
in 
the 
light 
of 
Old 
Testament 
symbols 
and 
sequences 
The 
same 
is 
true 
of 
the 
epistle 
Bruce 
a 
reformed 
OT 
scholar 
who 
also 
taught 
at 
s 
seminary 
was 
also 
strongly 
in 
favor 
of 
abortion 
He 
said 
the 
unborn 
child 
t 
have 
a 
soul 
and 
abortion 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
th 
commandment 
and 
it 
was 
primarily 
an 
economic 
decision 
Not 
just 
silent 
though 
Paul 
who 
was 
there 
at 
Westminster 
Seminary 
s 
founding 
as 
the 
leading 
church 
historian 
who 
was 
there 
with 
for 
the 
s 
founding 
was 
adamantly 
pro 
abortion 
and 
called 
an 
unborn 
child 
an 
entity 
and 
abstraction 
This 
is 
something 
uncomfortable 
to 
talk 
about 
but 
all 
the 
institutions 
were 
silent 
too 
As 
far 
as 
I 
know 
nobody 
in 
the 
reformed 
world 
even 
attempted 
to 
address 
the 
issue 
until 
the 
resurgence 
This 
type 
of 
Christian 
pessimism 
and 
denial 
of 
responsibility 
led 
to 
the 
silence 
It 
also 
led 
to 
the 
vacuum 
that 
Social 
Justice 
progressives 
are 
attempting 
to 
fill 
They 
felt 
it 
was 
wrong 
to 
get 
involved 
in 
issues 
of 
justice 
because 
we 
are 
just 
passing 
through 
this 
life 
with 
our 
eyes 
fixed 
on 
heavenly 
spiritual 
things 
The 
world 
was 
going 
to 
inevitably 
keep 
getting 
worse 
so 
why 
polish 
the 
brass 
on 
a 
sinking 
ship 
What 
do 
you 
think 
Lord 
means 
Okay 
I 
ll 
give 
it 
a 
chance 
t 
co 
t 
co 
r 
Stop 
misusing 
the 
phrase 
respecter 
of 
persons 
It 
means 
showing 
more 
respect 
to 
people 
based 
on 
their 
social 
standing 
If 
anything 
God 
does 
the 
opposite 
Jesus 
was 
the 
promise 
That 
s 
what 
they 
believed 
in 
They 
t 
know 
the 
name 
of 
his 
mum 
or 
all 
the 
details 
of 
his 
ministry 
They 
believed 
in 
the 
promise 
of 
a 
redeemer 
whose 
image 
became 
clearer 
as 
revelation 
progressed 
If 
you 
re 
just 
scared 
of 
going 
to 
hell 
so 
you 
say 
a 
little 
prayer 
because 
you 
think 
that 
s 
some 
type 
of 
magical 
cheat 
code 
to 
a 
good 
afterlife 
then 
I 
m 
sorry 
but 
that 
s 
not 
how 
it 
works 
Nobody 
knew 
Christ 
was 
pretty 
clear 
on 
this 
point 
O 
foolish 
ones 
and 
slow 
of 
heart 
to 
believe 
all 
that 
the 
prophets 
have 
spoken 
Was 
it 
not 
necessary 
that 
the 
Christ 
should 
suffer 
these 
things 
and 
enter 
into 
his 
glory 
just 
because 
I 
m 
not 
an 
antinomian 
that 
t 
make 
me 
a 
I 
m 
talking 
about 
what 
s 
going 
in 
the 
heart 
If 
you 
treat 
the 
cross 
as 
a 
fire 
insurance 
policy 
you 
re 
doing 
the 
NC 
version 
of 
going 
through 
the 
motions 
with 
an 
animal 
sacrifice 
Won 
t 
help 
you 
I 
m 
not 
a 
big 
fan 
of 
most 
contemporary 
Christian 
musicians 
on 
account 
of 
my 
inexplicable 
inauthentic 
detecting 
radar 
but 
I 
do 
enjoy 
some 
contemporary 
takes 
on 
the 
psalms 
In 
the 
sphere 
of 
religion 
as 
in 
other 
spheres 
the 
things 
about 
which 
men 
are 
agreed 
are 
apt 
to 
be 
the 
things 
that 
are 
That 
s 
putting 
it 
lightly 
Like 
I 
said 
approaching 
the 
atonement 
without 
the 
right 
heart 
is 
worthy 
of 
God 
s 
anger 
in 
any 
administration 
People 
do 
this 
today 
by 
treating 
the 
atonement 
as 
a 
fire 
insurance 
policy 
Let 
him 
that 
stole 
steal 
no 
more 
but 
rather 
let 
him 
working 
with 
his 
hands 
the 
thing 
which 
is 
good 
that 
he 
may 
have 
to 
give 
to 
him 
that 
Ephesians 
We 
live 
in 
a 
world 
were 
that 
word 
has 
become 
almost 
exclusively 
negative 
and 
it 
often 
is 
but 
phrases 
like 
false 
religion 
would 
be 
a 
meaningless 
jumble 
of 
words 
without 
its 
opposite 
i 
e 
true 
religion 
James 
characterizes 
this 
pure 
religion 
as 
being 
unstained 
by 
the 
world 
Dear 
Reader 
of 
the 
Bible 
Skipping 
Leviticus 
will 
leave 
you 
without 
the 
tools 
to 
understand 
the 
bulk 
of 
the 
theological 
Carl 
Trueman 
notes 
that 
while 
Luther 
and 
Zwingli 
could 
agree 
on 
fourteen 
theological 
points 
laid 
out 
at 
the 
Coll 
We 
are 
religious 
faith 
based 
creatures 
People 
who 
reject 
the 
true 
God 
have 
to 
create 
an 
imitation 
to 
fill 
the 
void 
It 
s 
just 
how 
we 
are 
We 
live 
in 
a 
society 
where 
religion 
is 
a 
bad 
word 
and 
everyone 
and 
their 
mother 
bends 
over 
backwards 
to 
deny 
they 
have 
a 
religion 
but 
everyone 
has 
a 
religion 
Everyone 
has 
faith 
something 
Even 
the 
atheist 
has 
faith 
in 
his 
anti 
religion 
but 
it 
is 
still 
faith 
and 
still 
religion 
Not 
about 
me 
t 
co 
So 
you 
don 
t 
have 
a 
religion 
YOU 
DO 
THOUGH 
BECAUSE 
EVERYONE 
DOES 
EVEN 
THE 
ATHEIST 
and 
now 
you 
claim 
the 
authority 
to 
redefine 
the 
meaning 
of 
words 
to 
suit 
your 
personal 
needs 
Okay 
You 
got 
a 
religion 
It 
consists 
of 
you 
who 
you 
basically 
elected 
as 
pope 
Hard 
work 
People 
went 
to 
the 
temple 
which 
was 
the 
like 
a 
God 
approved 
Disney 
Land 
of 
the 
time 
bought 
a 
bird 
and 
had 
somebody 
else 
kill 
it 
They 
hung 
out 
with 
friends 
They 
ate 
food 
and 
drank 
wine 
and 
praised 
God 
and 
got 
atonement 
You 
re 
acting 
like 
it 
s 
farming 
I 
do 
everyday 
But 
here 
s 
the 
thing 
because 
Christ 
was 
a 
greater 
sacrifice 
that 
t 
mean 
the 
lessor 
sacrifice 
was 
garbage 
during 
its 
day 
I 
m 
sorry 
but 
did 
you 
pick 
your 
religion 
based 
on 
how 
lazy 
you 
can 
be 
It 
seems 
like 
a 
driving 
factor 
Okay 
so 
if 
you 
do 
it 
does 
that 
merit 
anything 
No 
you 
re 
back 
to 
square 
one 
and 
if 
you 
do 
it 
with 
an 
improper 
heart 
you 
re 
worse 
off 
then 
before 
So 
since 
it 
is 
an 
act 
of 
grace 
even 
though 
it 
requires 
getting 
off 
your 
butt 
it 
is 
not 
a 
works 
based 
system 
Let 
me 
clarify 
A 
reprobate 
is 
not 
simply 
a 
bad 
boy 
sinner 
No 
human 
knows 
who 
is 
a 
reprobate 
and 
it 
is 
sinful 
to 
presume 
that 
you 
have 
that 
power 
Some 
of 
the 
worst 
sinners 
convert 
but 
that 
was 
part 
of 
God 
s 
plan 
You 
re 
misunderstanding 
this 
To 
sacrifice 
an 
animal 
for 
sin 
might 
seem 
like 
work 
to 
you 
but 
it 
was 
actually 
a 
means 
of 
Grace 
We 
t 
using 
the 
same 
words 
in 
the 
same 
ways 
right 
now 
Adam 
and 
Eve 
were 
the 
only 
ones 
to 
operate 
under 
a 
covenant 
of 
works 
and 
it 
was 
a 
super 
simple 
one 
Paul 
says 
the 
charismatic 
gifts 
were 
passing 
away 
That 
s 
why 
is 
a 
biblical 
response 
rather 
than 
simply 
an 
observational 
response 
Okay 
you 
peaked 
my 
interest 
Care 
to 
be 
less 
cryptic 
You 
mean 
like 
some 
far 
out 
hologram 
And 
some 
literal 
woman 
is 
going 
to 
stand 
on 
the 
literal 
moon 
either 
before 
or 
after 
it 
turns 
to 
literal 
blood 
and 
literal 
suns 
are 
literally 
going 
to 
enter 
our 
solar 
system 
Oh 
and 
we 
can 
see 
the 
literal 
woman 
on 
the 
literal 
moon 
literally 
from 
earth 
It 
is 
geographical 
ecological 
expression 
that 
is 
not 
meant 
to 
be 
taken 
literally 
Milk 
flows 
from 
mammals 
not 
land 
Oh 
and 
the 
moon 
is 
going 
to 
turn 
into 
literal 
blood 
too 
I 
forgot 
to 
mention 
that 
Matthew 
Where 
is 
the 
river 
of 
milk 
Where 
So 
when 
Jesus 
says 
the 
sun 
is 
going 
to 
die 
and 
the 
suns 
from 
other 
solar 
systems 
are 
going 
to 
collide 
with 
planet 
earth 
but 
people 
in 
Judea 
should 
flee 
to 
the 
mountains 
to 
survive 
the 
impact 
maybe 
you 
need 
to 
take 
your 
literalism 
down 
a 
notch 
Now 
if 
you 
are 
tracking 
with 
me 
on 
the 
land 
of 
milk 
and 
honey 
not 
being 
some 
wild 
ecosystem 
keep 
in 
mind 
that 
t 
even 
from 
a 
vision 
or 
dream 
which 
requires 
additional 
non 
If 
Moses 
said 
they 
would 
enter 
a 
land 
of 
milk 
and 
honey 
and 
you 
think 
that 
actually 
happened 
then 
you 
are 
a 
on 
that 
issue 
If 
some 
one 
who 
t 
understand 
the 
prophetic 
idiom 
says 
hey 
the 
land 
t 
made 
of 
honey 
you 
correct 
them 
Yes 
What 
kind 
of 
question 
is 
that 
Yep 
Imagine 
Satan 
repenting 
and 
believing 
Hypothetically 
possible 
Pointless 
question 
Fallen 
beings 
are 
basically 
the 
same 
The 
difference 
is 
God 
s 
saving 
grace 
which 
He 
does 
not 
dispense 
universally 
Wow 
I 
only 
ever 
seen

at

Do 
you

After 
posting 
this 
I 
thought 
of 
the 
church 
plant 
in 
my 
neighborhood 
that 
t 
have 
Presbyterian 
in 
the 
name 
has 
the 
word 
City 
in 
the 
name 
and 
has 
the 
affiliation 
buried 
on 
its 
It 
is 
basically 
an 
adult 
youth 
group 
They 
have 
folk 
hipster 
stuff 
I 
want 
to 
also 
add 
that 
Augustine 
did 
not 
invent 
this 
approach 
It 
was 
a 
very 
common 
method 
of 
interpreting 
scripture 
of 
Alexandria 
used 
it 
All 
of 
the 
NT 
writers 
used 
it 
as 
well 
I 
m 
not 
so 
sure 
about 
that 
Paul 
put 
very 
capable 
elders 
and 
deacons 
in 
charge 
at 
those 
churches 
in 
Asia 
Minor 
They 
were 
more 
than 
capable 
of 
clarifying 
anything 
a 
new 
convert 
from 
paganism 
might 
be 
confused 
about 
When 
Paul 
brought 
up 
Abraham 
s 
two 
sons 
did 
he 
view 
them 
as 
a 
Or 
did 
he 
see 
allegorical 
truth 
ALSO 
present 
When 
Paul 
brought 
up 
the 
law 
against 
muzzling 
the 
ox 
did 
he 
see 
it 
as 
a 
i 
e 
a 
law 
that 
applied 
specifically 
and 
only 
to 
ox 
Or 
did 
he 
view 
it 
as 
something 
bigger 
than 
a 
passage 
about 
oxen 
Historical 
narrative 
poetry 
visions 
dreams 
parables 
songs 
wisdom 
literature 
abstract 
doctrine 
etc 
etc 
Do 
you 
include 
genre 
in 
the 
what 
category 
So 
you 
don 
t 
reject 
God 
s 
law 
you 
just 
reject 
the 
idea 
that 
you 
have 
any 
obligation 
to 
acknowledge 
it 
as 
applicable 
for 
you 
Nothing 
you 
said 
up 
this 
point 
has 
indicated 
that 
you 
see 
any 
of 
those 
things 
as 
applicable 
to 
Christians 
You 
need 
to 
put 
on 
your 
thinking 
cap 
and 
interpret 
it 
based 
on 
what 
it 
is 
trying 
to 
convey 
Scripture 
t 
baby 
us 
by 
spelling 
out 
every 
use 
of 
figures 
or 
symbols 
or 
double 
meanings 
It 
expects 
us 
to 
see 
it 
Or 
they 
were 
reading 
scriptures 
and 
singing 
psalms 
and 
learning 
those 
things 
because 
they 
were 
deepening 
in 
their 
faith 
I 
t 
say 
that 
everything 
was 
allegorical 
So 
if 
I 
look 
in 
the 
writings 
of 
Paul 
I 
won 
t 
find 
page 
after 
page 
after 
page 
after 
page 
of 
quotes 
from 
Judaism 
That 
s 
the 
nature 
of 
a 
dichotomy 
The 
two 
parts 
are 
warring 
against 
each 
other 
what 
verse 
is 
that 
in 
Scripture 
t 
speak 
in 
terms 
of 
literal 
The 
word 
appears 
no 
where 
Most 
symbols 
are 
self 
evident 
They 
don 
t 
need 
to 
spell 
it 
out 
to 
the 
readers 
because 
that 
s 
just 
how 
ancient 
people 
thought 
Modern 
western 
man 
has 
this 
literal 
obsession 
There 
is 
no 
dichotomy 
There 
s 
a 
dichotomy 
between 
truth 
and 
falsehood 
but 
there 
is 
no 
dichotomy 
in 
which 
scripture 
is 
fighting 
against 
itself 
I 
never 
given 
a 
Paul 
was 
Jewish 
Stop 
pretending 
he 
s 
a 
gentile 
honorary 
or 
not 
You 
reject 
God 
s 
law 
and 
you 
reject 
norms 
How 
are 
you 
not 
an 
antinomian 
There 
was 
no 
such 
things 
as 
parentheses 
back 
then 
It 
s 
a 
man 
made 
idea 
applied 
anachronistically 
to 
the 
bible 
in 
a 
violent 
way 
I 
gave 
you 
a 
quote 
from 
a 
hyper 
regarding 
the 
blasphemy 
of 
repentance 
and 
I 
asked 
if 
you 
agreed 
and 
you 
did 
This 
when 
we 
first 
spoke 
Don 
t 
take 
my 
word 
for 
it

it 
yourself 
How 
many 
people 
do 
you

who 
are

All 
I 
experienced 
from

the

single 
piano 
but 
what 
about 
this 
praise 
band 
hoedown 
Is 
this 
a 
common 
thing 
Repentance 
involves 
humility 
I 
m 
not 
sure 
if 
you 
can 
muster 
that 
up 
I 
am 
not 
sure 
I 
have 
repented 
I 
just 
go 
on 
and 
try 
to 
do 
a 
better 
job 
from 
there 
I 
don 
t 
think 
so 
I 
think 
if 
I 
do 
something 
wrong 
I 
think 
I 
just 
try 
and 
make 
it 
right 
I 
don 
t 
bring 
God 
into 
that 
picture 
I 
don

Id 
I 
believe 
that 
is 
how 
the 
great 
theologian 
Donald 
J 
Trump 
defines 
repentance 
but 
we 
Christians 
have 
a 
fuller 
understanding 
of 
it 
that 
also 
involved 
a 
change 
of 
thinking 
You 
think 
he 
came 
to 
earth 
to 
set 
up 
some 
nationalistic 
Kingdom 
right 
I 
must 
have 
missed 
that 
big 
announcement 
What 
s 
wrong 
with 
Which 
manuscript 
speaks 
of 
the 
parentheses 
I 
already 
put 
you 
into 
a 
corner 
and 
pushed 
you 
until 
you 
confessed 
your 
incorrect 
belief 
that 
you 
believe 
repentance 
is 
blasphemy 
I 
believe 
you 
called 
it 
denying 
the 
sufficiency 
of 
Christ 
s 
death 
None 
of 
the 
the 
writers 
of 
the 
NT 
use 
the 
method 
You 
re 
all 
alone 
Every 
Rabbi 
thinks

is 
a 
You 
act 
like 
using 
that 
word 
is 
a 
checkmate 
for 
your 
position 
It 
is 
not 
Shank 
t 
believe 
in 
repentance 
Satan 
knows 
what 
Christ 
did 
BTW 
The 
law 
written 
on 
the 
heart 
is 
sanctification 
which 
you 
have 
a 
serious 
problem 
with 
addressing 
It 
s 
not 
your 
fault 
I 
blame 
the 
teachers 
who 
brainwashed 
you 
with 
this 
nonsense 
who 
you 
pretend 
don 
t 
exist 
You 
equate 
everyone 
against

I 
don 
t 
think 
you 
know 
what 
that 
word 
means 
You 
can 
t 
tell 
the 
difference 
between 
legalism 
and 
sanctification 
You 
re 
mixing 
yourself 
up 
Don 
t 
you 
see 
how 
your 
two 
sets 
of 
ideas 
are 
in 
contradiction 
Christians 
t 
under 
the 
law 
because 
they 
walk 
in 
the 
spirit 
They 
t 
have 
to 
be 
told 
not 
to 
murder 
because 
the 
spirit 
wrote 
it 
on 
their 
hearts 
You 
already 
admitted 
that 
conversion 
leads 
to 
good 
works 
yet 
you 
find 
a 
way 
to 
compartmentalize 
that 
so 
it 
has 
no 
real 
impact 
on 
your 
system 
You 
do 
that 
with 
a 
lot 
of 
stuff 
man 
Hold 
up 
It 
sounds 
like 
you 
re 
saying 
they 
don 
t 
need 
to 
be 
under 
the 
law 
because 
the 
law 
is 
written 
on 
their 
heart 
so 
all 
they 
have 
to 
do 
is 
walk 
in 
the 
spirit 
but 
you 
already 
denied 
all 
of 
that 
I 
don 
t 
think 
you 
know 
what 
that 
word 
even 
means 
or 
understand 
how 
I 
have 
been 
using 
it 
Almost 
every 
and 
is 
some 
form 
of 
and 
there 
s 
a 
lot 
of 
those 
Amen 
There 
s 
something 
about 
going 
through 
that 
sort 
of 
experience 
that 
makes 
one 
grasp 
sovereignty 
on 
an 
experiential 
level 
I 
know 
former 
addicts 
who 
despise 
everything 
about 
Calvin 
but 
when 
they 
start 
talking 
about 
coming 
out 
of 
addiction 
they 
sound 
super 
Calvinistic 
same 
here 
I 
first 
heard 
of 
the 
phrase 
from 
and 
Needless 
to 
say 
I 
am 
a 
convert 
who 
once 
did 
a 
lot 
of 
drugs 
I 
was 
attempting 
to 
be 
cheeky 
Now 
don 
t 
get 
me 
wrong 
I 
m 
not 
going 
to 
pussyfoot 
I 
think 
the 
PB 
position 
is 
wrong 
if 
I 
t 
I 
would 
be 
a 
PB 
I 
t 
rest 
my 
case 
on 
pointing 
out 
semantic 
similarities 
with 
atheists 
If 
I 
understand 
the 
PB 
position 
correctly 
it 
is 
that 
the 
decision 
is 
the 
result 
of 
regeneration 
and 
the 
general 
baptist 
sees 
it 
in 
reverse 
Now 
certainly 
the 
atheist 
has 
no 
category 
for 
regeneration 
only 
social 
conditioning 
and 
existential 
insecurity 
Paul 
speaks 
about 
condemnation 
wrath 
works 
and 
perseverance 
but 
like 
the 
unregenerate 
scribe 
during 
Jesus 
times 
you 
don

What 
does 
it 
mean 
to 
not 
be 
under 
the 
law 
Does 
it 
mean 
that 
murder 
is 
okay 
What 
about 
stealing 
What 
about 
worshiping 
idols 
Or 
that 
s 
how 
you 
patch 
the 
holes 
in 
your 
busted 
theology 
That 
s 
why 
I 
threw 
in 
the 
not 
a 
good 
look 
part 
to 
draw 
attention 
to 
the 
surface 
of 
it 
Jokes 
and 
polemics 
aside 
a 
particular 
baptist 
and 
an 
atheist 
have 
different 
reasons 
behind 
their 
objections 
They 
just 
happen 
to 
semantically 
overlap 
You 
follow 
your 
own 
delusions 
Are 
you 
not 
a 
man 
Paul 
makes 
vague 
statements 
that 
you 
are 
stretching 
way 
beyond 
their 
reasonableness 
and 
to 
the 
point 
of 
actually 
contradicting 
things 
Paul 
said 
You 
re 
confusing 
yourself 
They 
spoke 
of 
it 
Have 
you 
not 
read 
about 
the 
knowledge 
of 
YAHWEH 
going 
out 
to 
ends 
of 
the 
earth 
WHAT 
ARE 
YOU 
SAYING 
What 
mysteries 
Be 
specific 
Are 
you 
talking 
about 
something 
like 
nobody 
knew 
that 
some 
guy 
named 
Saul 
would 
be 
told 
by 
the 
spirit 
not 
to 
go 
to 
some 
particular 
town 
What 
are 
you 
actually 
saying 
that 
s 
now 
how 
prophecy 
works 
The 
details 
unfold 
and 
get 
more 
specific 
over 
time 
The 
emphasis 
is 
on 
continuity 
not 
discontinuity 
That 
s 
a 
problem 
Let 
them 
make 
their 
own 
decision 
when 
they 
are 
old 
enough 
to 
make 
it 
for 
themselves 
is 
the 
credo 
position 
is 
it 
not 
Not 
theologically 
So 
you 
re 
saying 
that 
because 
someone 
t 
keep 
the 
Sabbath 
holy 
they 
are 
free 
to 
go 
around 
committing 
mass 
murder 
What 
are 
you 
actually 
saying 
I 
ll 
paraphrase 
what 
I 
recall 
reading 
from 
the 
thread 
LET 
THEM 
MAKE 
THEIR 
OWN 
DECISION 
IF 
THEY 
WANT 
TO 
JOIN 
YOUR 
STUPID 
CULT 
LET 
THEM 
DO 
IT 
THEMSELVES 
All 
that 
the 
prophets 
have 
spoken 
Was 
it 
not 
necessary 
that 
the 
Christ 
should 
suffer 
these 
things 
and 
enter 
into 
his 
glory 
And 
beginning 
with 
Moses 
and 
all 
the 
Prophets 
he 
interpreted 
to 
them 
in 
all 
the 
Scriptures 
the 
things 
concerning 
himself 
I 
don 
t 
see 
that 
in 
my 
Bible 
Do 
you 
have 
the 
expanded 
The 
audience 
was 
the 
church 
in 
the 
first 
century 
You 
re 
thinking 
like 
a 
liberal 
So 
you 
listed 
one 
thing 
which 
can 
be 
debated 
Do 
you 
have 
any 
more 
Not 
a 
good 
look 
They 
had 
some 
of 
the 
same 
arguments 
too 
Not 
I 
I 
think 
churches 
and 
Christians 
that 
refuse 
to

Christ 
explained

The

You 
are

announcing

radically 
unforeseen 
totally 
different 
message 
that 
had

else 
in

does

point 
to

being 
in

of

in

very

It 
happened 
to

times

What 
I 
was 
referring 
to 
is 
a 
measure 
of 
what 
is 
often 
called 
God 
s 
Common 
Grace 
to 
unbelievers 
I 
m 
just 
wondering 
about 
the 
accusation 
It 
s 
an 
odd 
accusation 
He 
was 
differentiating 
his 
message 
from 
the 
HERETICS 
the 
other 
apostles 
were 
not 
heretics

you 
talking 
about 
Did 
you 
notice 
that 
I 
said 
additional 
assurance 
Good 
works 
are 
also 
a 
measure 
before 
the 
Church 
Every 
church 
worthy 
of 
the 
name 
would 
not 
allow 
membership 
to 
someone 
who 
simply 
claimed 
faith 
but 
lived 
like 
an 
unrepentant 
heathen 
of 
the 
time 
So 
now 
you 
re 
turning 
Paul 
against 
Paul 
to 
support 
your 
warped 
interpretation 
of 
Paul 
Bravo 
Paul 
told 
the 
Church 
to 
judge

Church 
Jesus 
told 
the 
Church 
to 
judge

told 
the 
Church 
to 
judge

Church 
We 
are 
commanded 
to 
do 
this

basis 
of 
behavior 
Good 
works

for 
additional 
assurance

shows 
the 
spirit 
has 
sealed 
you 
and 
you 
re 
not 
just 
engaging 
in 
wishful 
thinking 
self 
deception 
It 
shows 
God 
is 
actually 
conforming 
you 
to 
the 
image 
of 
His 
Son 
If 
that 
s 
not 
happening 
and 
you 
reject 
the 
whole 
idea 
you 
got 
problems 
So 
if 
God 
takes 
away 
protection 
from 
an 
individual 
or 
group 
and 
allows 
Satan 
do 
what 
he 
wants 
what 
s 
going 
to 
happen 
Do 
you

you 
will 
accept 
stuff

books

not

that

just

Well 
Satan

evil 
so 
he

God

Satan

only

God 
has 
one 
people 
If 
that 
is 
so 
they 
were 
not 
being 
faithful 
to 
the 
Greek 
I 
believe 
that 
it 
is 
misleadingly 
translated 
by 
the 
Catholics 
and 
Anglicans 
as 
Testament 
but 
the 
word 
is 
covenant 
Bad 
translations 
why 
you 
afraid 
of 
the 
covenant 
It 
is 
a 
grotesque 
perversion 
Amen 
You 
equate 
the 
body 
of 
Christ 
with 
gentiles 
for 
no 
good 
reason 
It 
is 
a 
translation 
issue 
for 
the 
He 
is 
a 
Paul 
He 
rejects 
everyone 
else 
as 
too 
Jewish 
for 
his 
tastes 
According 
to 
the 
yes 
According 
to 
the 
Greek 
nope 
Why 
do 
you 
reject 
the 
new 
covenant 
The 
was 
a 
middle 
ages 
thing 
He 
will 
not 
listen 
The 
covenant 
of 
grace 
began 
after 
the 
fall 
There 
are 
those 
who 
only 
accept 
Paul 
s 
prison 
letters 
He 
will 
not 
answer 
this 
because 
he 
is 
basically 
an 
anarchist 
in 
regards 
to 
authority 
He 
does 
not 
want 
a 
king 
I 
have 
been 
trying 
to 
get 
him 
to 
answer 
those 
questions 
since 
I 
first 
started 
talking 
to 
him 
Good 
luck 
You 
have 
wacky 
interpretation 
of 
those 
verses 
too 
You 
are 
adding 
stuff 
to 
what 
John 
wrote 
They 
are 
Paul 
so 
they 
just 
try 
to 
find 
something 
that 
says 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
Paul 
even 
though 
the 
continuity 
undermines 
their 
claims 
of 
radical 
discontinuity 
I 
m 
not 
trying 
to 
be 
rude 
but 
if 
unity 
was 
the 
goal 
what 
s 
the 
point 
of 
getting 
so 
close 
Is 
it 
too 
much 
to 
ask 
to 
baptize 
your 
kids 
into 
the 
covenant 
and 
have 
some 
authority 
above 
the 
congregation 
It 
s 
not 
first 
to 
the 
Jews 
and 
then 
something 
completely 
radically 
different 
and 
distinct 
and 
discontinuous 
to 
everyone 
else

The 
Holy 
Spirit 
is 
there 
guiding 
you 
and 
keeping 
you 
from 
permanently 
falling 
away 
but 
that 
means 
you

no

Is 
God 
making 
saved 
people 
puppets 
by 
keeping 
them 
from 
falling 
away 
t 
that 
some 
violation 
of 
human 
rights 
or 
something 
I 
agree 
So 
where 
s 
the 
autonomous 
free 
will 
in 
all 
that 
Because 
scripture 
assumed 
that 
people 
would 
understand 
that 
Saul 
was 
under 
God 
s 
judgment 
For 
me 
I 
believe 
that 
God 
providentially 
ensures 
that 
His 
people 
persevere 
This 
is 
not 
a 
problem 
for 
me 
because 
I 
do 
not 
have 
a 
free 
will 
fetish 
The 
are 
at 
least 
consistent 
on 
this 
issue 
Saul 
was 
not 
sealed 
He 
was 
an 
enemy 
of 
God 
We 
sing 
psalms 
about 
God 
graciously 
crushing 
Saul 
the 
chief 
enemy 
of 
David 
Saul 
was 
a 
type 
of 
How 
many 
of 
David 
s 
psalms 
are 
likely 
about 
how 
God 
is 
going 
to 
crush 
Saul 
for 
eternity 
Can 
they 
lose 
their 
faith 
and 
keep 
their 
salvation 
Saul 
was 
under 
God 
s 
wrath 
You 
re 
making 
a 
big 
deal 
about 
a 
tiny 
phrase 
that 
clearly 
indicates 
that 
Saul 
was 
about 
to 
meet 
his 
maker 
Samuel 
said 
Why 
do 
you 
consult 
me 
now 
that 
the 
Lord 
has 
departed 
from 
you 
and 
become 
your 
enemy 
Saul 
was 
a 
cursed 
individual 
who 
engaged 
in 
a 
capital 
offense 
without 
any 
repentance 
and 
committed 
suicide 
Why 
do 
you 
assume 
that 
Samuel 
was 
saying 
anything 
more 
than 
soon 
you 
re 
going 
to 
die 
What 
does 
it 
say 
What 
does 
it 
not 
say 
I 
m 
talking 
about 
a 
man 
who 
became 
a 
Satanist 
He 
gave 
his 
soul 
to 
the 
devil 
He 
engaged 
in 
Satanic 
rituals 
God 
struck 
him 
down 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
one 
This 
is 
all 
shades 
of 
to 
you 
Does 
it 
really 
make 
a 
difference 
if 
he 
made 
a 
profession 
of 
faith 
Does 
it 
mean 
that 
he 
can 
renounce 
it 
and 
put 
himself 
under 
the 
headship 
of 
Satan 
with 
no 
consequences 
Yeah 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
the 
dead 
The 
inner 
man 
wanted 
to 
go 
to 
a 
Satanic 
orgy 
and 
God 
struck 
him 
down 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
it 
What 
else 
do 
you 
need 
to 
know 
Another 
question 
once 
the 
Holy 
Spirit 
indwells 
a 
believer 
does 
the 
believer 
lose 
his 
free 
will 
to 
become 
a 
Satanist 
until 
the 
day 
he 
dies 
OR 
did 
he 
just 
lose 
some 
of 
his 
rewards 
Would 
I 
be 
a 
fruit 
inspector 
for 
saying 
that 
the 
guy 
who 
had 
a 
heart 
attack 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
a 
Satanic 
orgy 
probably 
t 
saved 
to 
begin 
with 
But 
but 
but 
but 
but 
I 
wish 
I 
could 
find 
the 
quote 
and 
the 
source 
of 
the 
quote 
but 
I 
have 
heard 
people 
from 
your 
camp 
saying 
something 
along 
the 
lines 
of 
there 
are 
people 
who 
could 
have 
died 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
performing 
a 
Satanic 
ritual 
who 
go 
to 
heaven 
because 
they 
once 
had 
faith 
What 
about 
through 
their 
own 
free 
will 
Did 
they 
lose 
that 
when 
they 
became 
a 
believer 
I 
m 
not 
saying 
that 
it 
does 
include 
you 
Your 
camp 
is 
the 
camp 
saying 
that 
perseverance 
is 
not 
necessary 
meaning 
that 
apostasy 
is 
okay 
People 
don 
t 
have 
the 
free 
will 
to 
exit 
Falling 
away 
from 
the 
faith 
Perseverance 
looks 
like 
not 
dying 
as 
an 
apostate 
years 
was 
a 
symbolic 
number 
in 
the 
prophetic 
idiom 
and 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
prophets 
and 
the 
historical 
records 
are 
irrelevant 
Now 
these 
are 
the 
two 
orthodox 
possibilities 
I 
am 
open 
to 
either 
one 
but 
option 
one 
has 
some 
work 
to 
do 
There 
are 
two 
possible 
orthodox 
answers 
The 
hyper 
are 
correct 
in 
this 
one 
instance 
the 
Babylonian 
captivity 
lasted 
precisely 
years 
and 
every 
single 
Babylonian 
record 
is 
incredibly 
wrong 
not 
by 
a 
couple 
of 
years 
but 
by 
decades 
If 
you 
do 
not 
persevere 
endure 
finish 
the 
race 
and 
you 
die 
outside 
the 
faith 
then 
you 
get 
nothing 
Are 
they 
going 
to 
build 
a 
temple 
with 
a 
river 
that 
makes

oceans

God 
s 
providences 
both 
favorable 
and 
adverse 
are 
often 
powerful 
means 
of 
sanctification 
The 
Apostle 
Paul 
commended 
his 
readers 
for 
testing 
what 
he 
said 
in 
comparison 
with 
other 
scripture 
He 
was 
not 
a 
Paul 
He 
saw 
continuity 
between 
what 
he 
was 
saying 
and 
the 
whole 
council 
of 
God 
Paul 
who 
I 
have 
not 
purchased 
this 
book 
and 
I 
have 
read 
many 
of 
the 
early 
writings 
and 
there 
is 
no 
way 
to 
honestly 
present 
them 
as 
It 
s 
actually 
laughable 
It 
s 
not 
too 
hard 
Just 
admit 
it 
You 
don 
t 
have 
the 
answers 
Say 
you 
ll 
give 
it 
some 
more 
thought 
It 
s 
okay 
Like 
I 
said 
you 
re 
being 
evasive 
If 
you 
can 
t 
answer 
the 
question 
directly 
then 
just 
say 
so 
Like 
I 
already 
said 
he 
went 
off 
on 
to 
some 
other 
side 
road 
that 
I 
t 
asking 
about 
I 
m 
asking 
are 
you 
persevering 
in 
the 
faith 
Do 
you 
reject 
the 
faith 
Do 
you 
renounce 
it 
Do 
you 
have 
the 
power 
to 
do 
that 
You 
are 
playing 
games 
right 
now 
You 
don 
t 
like 
these 
questions 
because 
you 
want 
two 
contradictory 
things 
to 
be 
true 
at 
the 
same 
time 
This 
cannot 
be 
the 
case 
so 
you 
re 
being 
slippery 
He 
did 
not 
answer 
my 
question 
at 
all 
He 
went 
off 
on 
a 
totally 
different 
side 
road 
Let 
me 
ask 
again 
are 
you 
persevering 
in 
the 
faith 
Do 
you 
have 
the 
free 
will 
to 
not 
persevere 
in 
the 
faith 
Okay 
this 
is 
a 
joke 
Let 
me 
know 
when 
you 
are 
going 
to 
stop 
playing 
games 
This 
is 
what 
I 
was 
just 
talking 
about 
a 
minute 
ago 
You 
re 
trying 
to 
be 
evasive 
I 
m 
guessing 
that 
you 
know 
my 
answer 
but 
I 
m 
also 
guessing 
that 
you 
guys 
will 
do 
what 
you 
always 
do 
when 
this 
question 
comes 
up 
you 
will 
try 
to 
run 
away 
and 
not 
being 
direct 
I 
m 
asking 
you 
to 
be 
direct 
Is 
that 
asking 
too 
much 
I 
asked 
first 
Can 
you 
please 
answer 
my 
questions 
in 
a 
direct 
way 
Are 
you 
persevering 
Do 
you 
have 
the 
free 
will 
to 
not 
persevere 
So 
what 
you 
re 
saying 
is 
that 
you 
are 
persevering 
and 
you 
can 
t 
even 
use 
your 
precious 
free 
will 
to 
separate 
yourself 
from 
God 
Is 
this 
correct 
I 
m 
not 
asking 
you 
if 
you 
are 
focusing 
your 
mind 
on 
persevering 
I 
m 
asking 
you 
if 
you 
are 
in 
fact 
persevering 
To 
not 
persevere 
is 
to 
walk 
away 
from 
Christ 
Does 
that 
describe 
you 
Are 
you 
not 
persevering 
Covenant

doing 
damage

I 
do 
not 
know 
if 
you 
understand 
the 
position 
When 
they 
speak 
of 
the 
evil 
against 
the 
church 
they 
t 
talking 
about 
snow 
on 
a 
Sunday 
They 
are 
talking 
about 
people 
If 
it 
were 
the 
typical 
Christian 
Entertainment 
Industry 
film 
it 
would 
have 
been 
all 
about 
How 
Ethan 
Got 
His 
Groove 
Back 
but 
instead 
it 
was 
about 
how 
Ethan 
found 
a 
substitute 
religion 
politics 
embraced 
justification 
by 
political 
works 
and 
self 
destructed 
The 
falling 
away 
happened 
before 
the 
film 
even 
began 
The 
main 
character 
admitted 
to 
being 
incapable 
of 
praying 
A 
minister 
incapable 
of 
praying 
can 
t 
perform 
his 
office 
Well 
art 
is 
subjective 
But 
the 
theme 
was 
apostasy 
The 
was 
the 
furthest 
thing 
from 
his 
mind 
It 
was 
recited 
as 
a 
lackluster 
reenactment 
It 
was 
The 
filmmaker 
grew 
up 
reformed 
Went 
to 
Calvin 
College 
Became 
an 
apostate 
It 
is 
a 
look 
at 
him 
in 
a 
way 
as 
well 
He 
completely 
gave 
up 
on 
reformed 
thought 
if 
he 
ever 
believed 
it 
in 
the 
first 
place 
He 
had 
to 
justify 
himself 
The 
director 
went 
to 
Calvin 
College 
so 
he 
knew 
what 
he 
was 
bringing 
up 
and 
not 
bringing 
up 
They 
called 
the 
church 
a 
museum 
because 
it 
was 
and 
the 
main 
character 
was 
like 
a 
historical 
actor 
like 
at 
colonial 
Williamsburg 
He 
t 
believe 
it 
It 
was 
boring 
to 
him 
so 
when 
a 
trendy 
political 
issue 
came 
up 
he 
dove 
in 
I 
agree 
I 
took 
it 
as 
historic 
reformed 
theology 
in 
the 
northeast 
dying 
like 
the 
main 
character 
It 
was 
just 
going 
through 
the 
motions 
like 
a 
Civil 
War 
reenactment 
I 
think 
it 
was 
great 
I 
liked 
how 
it 
did 
not 
try 
to 
do 
what 
most 
Christian 
films 
do 
everyone 
gets 
saved 
It 
was 
vacuous 
because 
most 
of 
Christianity 
is 
vacuous 
Ethan 
lost 
faith 
and 
became 
obsessed 
with 
politics

A 
literal

Literal

You 
take 
everything 
so 
literally 
here 
You 
re 
talking 
about 
symbolism 
now 
I 
thought 
you 
t 
do 
that 
Who

woman 
Cool 
Do 
your 
hyper

with 
this 
And 
a

with

under 
her 
feet 
and 
on 
her 
head 
a 
crown 
of 
twelve 
stars 
This 
is 
correct 
If 
he 
wanted 
us 
to 
know 
he 
would 
have 
mentioned 
it 
Everyone 
no 
matter 
how 
confident 
is 
just 
speculating 
The 
point 
is 
that 
the 
two 
witnesses 
are 
part 
of 
the 
lawsuit 
against 
apostate 
Israel 
Elijah 
is 
not

into

You 
have 
presented 
texts 
that 
you 
fail 
to 
see 
the 
deepness 
of 
You 
interpret 
it 
at 
the 
most 
superficial 
level 
which 
you 
not 
just 
you 
but 
all 
fancy 
as 
the 
most 
God 
honoring 
literal 
sense 
That 
s 
because 
Jesus 
like 
every 
single 
person 
in 
scripture 
was 
not 
a 
wooden 
Please 
please 
please 
understand 
this 
point 
You 
are 
dishonoring 
the 
text 
by 
reading 
it 
as 
hyper 
literal 
John 
was 
a 
TYPE 
of 
Elijah 
If 
you 
think 
Elijah 
s 
spirit 
was 
literally 
in 
John 
the 
Baptist 
then 
you 
believe 
in 
reincarnation 
John 
the 
Baptist 
was 
not 
Elijah 
He 
symbolically 
represented 
Elijah 
on 
a 
typological 
level 
We 
do 
not 
believe 
in 
reincarnation 
People 
from 
all 
over 
the 
Roman 
Empire 
came 
to 
feast 
their 
eyes 
on 
the 
temple 
It 
was 
one 
of 
the 
major 
wonders 
of 
the 
world 
Ezekiel 
was 
in 
exile 
and 
God 
said 
the 
exile 
would 
end 
and 
they 
would 
return 
to 
the 
land 
and 
build 
the 
second 
temple 
He 
was 
given 
a 
symbolic 
vision 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
God 
s 
faithfulness 
to 
His 
promises 
It 
was 
the 
second 
temple 
Jesus 
confirmed 
a 
new 
covenant 
and 
was 
cut 
off 
making 
the 
sacrifice 
and 
the 
oblation 
obsolete 
and 
before 
his

I

sorry

way 
Peace 
I 
don 
t 
know 
anything 
about 
this 
tradition 
and 
I 
don 
t 
want 
to 
make 
a 
snap 
on 
a 
second

It 
s 
not

It 
probably 
should 
be

IMO 
Cool 
It 
s 
a 
cool 
song 
I 
m 
not 
knocking 
it 
but 
like 
everything 
it 
belongs 
in 
a 
proper 
context 
Singing 
patriotic 
American 
songs 
at 
American 
sporting 
events 
is 
one 
thing 
Going 
up 
in 
a 
foreigners 
face 
and 
singing 
the 
National 
Anthem 
is 
something 
entirely 
different 
I 
m 
not 
some 
dude 
making 
stuff 
up 
I 
learned 
this 
in 
grad 
school 
It 
s 
a 
variation 
on 
a 
custom 
that 
goes 
back 
centuries 
What 
means 
to 
imply 
is 
we 
i 
e 
all 
native 
people 
are 
united 
as 
one 
against 
you 
the 
boy 
in 
hat 
and 
by 
extension 
his 
entire 
group 
the 
song 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
sung 
together 
to 
foster 
unity 
among 
the 
various 
native 
nations 
Banging 
it 
in 
a 
non 
native 
face 
is 
provocative 
If 
this 
is 
news 
to 
you 
go 
ask 
your 
elders 
Scripture 
puts 
forward 
a 
demand 
for 
balance 
We 
are 
not 
to 
be 
so 
spiritually 
minded 
that 
we 
are 
no 
earthly 
good 
We 
are 
also 
advised 
not 
to 
become 
so 
focused 
on 
earthly 
things 
that 
we 
lose 
sight 
in 
the 
other 
extreme 
There 
s 
an 
earthly 
kingdom 
for 
everyone 
We 
re 
in 
it 
right 
now 
Christ 
is 
putting 
his 
enemies 
under 
his 
feet 
He 
has 
dominion 
We 
have 
a 
commission 
It 
is 
spiritual 
heavenly 
and 
on 
earth 
Now 
if 
you 
want 
to 
know 
what 
God 
wrote 
through 
the 
Apostle 
John 
and 
if 
you 
have 
ears 
to 
hear 
it 
pay 
close 
attention 
John 
wrote 
during 
THE 
TRIBULATION 
John 
writes 
t 
the 
tribulation 
I 
m 
sorry 
you 
have 
a 
bad 
translation 
I 
don 
t 
know 
what 
position 
you 
think 
you 
re 
arguing 
against 
I 
m 
at 
a 
loss 
for 
words 
Now 
if 
you 
are 
native 
and 
not 
some 
white 
person 
with 
guilt 
to 
atone 
for 
you 
would 
know 
what 
song 
it 
is 
and 
you 
would 
know 
perfectly 
well 
that 
banging 
a 
drum 
in 
the 
face 
of 
a 
white 
boy 
while 
singing 
the 
American 
Indian 
Movement 
song 
is 
not 
a 
friendly 
gesture 
Two 
points 
First 
you 
don 
t 
understand 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
God 
because 
if 
you 
did 
you 
t 
describe 
it 
like 
a 
zealot 
Secondly 
Paul 
was 
talking 
about 
it 
to 
the 
pagans 
as 
well 
which 
destroys 
your 
whole 
methodology 
because 
if 
you 
were 
right 
then 
Paul 
would 
not 
bring 
it 
up 
English 
is 
the 
only 
language 
that 
distinguishes 
between 
the 
two 
In 
most 
languages 
a 
song 
is 
a 
chant 
and 
a 
chant 
is 
a 
song 
but 
if 
you 
want 
to 
be 
superficial 
I 
can 
t 
stop 
you 
Same 
to 
you 
All 
the 
Paul 
Mid 
Acts 
never 
want 
to 
address 
Acts 
He 
lived 
there 
two 
whole 
years 
at 
his 
own 
expense 
and 
welcomed 
all 
who 
came 
to 
him 
proclaiming 
the 
KINGDOM 
OF 
GOD 
and 
teaching 
about 
the 
Lord 
Jesus 
Christ 
with 
all 
boldness 
and 
without 
hindrance 
It 
proved 
Jesus 
t 
a 
false 
prophet 
and 
the 
Old 
Covenant 
was 
over 
Nobody 
took 
him 
literally 
or 
they 
would 
have 
built 
the 
temple 
according 
to 
his 
specifications 
Also 
t 
there 
something 
about 
a 
river 
flowing 
out 
of 
the 
temple 
How 
are 
they 
going 
to 
create 
a 
river 
It 
s 
symbolic 
What 
year 
did 
it 
start 
What 
year 
did 
it 
end 
Does 
the 
number 
equal 
You 
re 
assuming 
that 
Daniel 
has 
the 
same 
modern 
western 
understanding 
of 
numbers 
as 
you 
do 
I 
asked 
for 
the 
math 
where 
two 
years 
are 
provided 
and 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
is 
exactly 
Do 
you 
understand 
the 
cultural 
significance 
of 
beating 
a 
drum 
in 
the 
face 
of 
someone

singing 
the 
AIM 
American

your 
point

I

The 
Roman 
Empire 
broke 
out 
into 
Civil 
War 
after 
the 
death 
of 
Nero 
People 
thought 
that 
it 
was 
the 
end 
of 
the 
empire 
until 
Vespasian 
took 
over 
started 
the 
dynasty 
It

the

of

The

The

time 
The

Well

You

his

Now 
do 
you 
understand 
the 
difference 
between 
a 
prophetic 
vision 
described 
in 
the 
prophetic 
idiom 
and 
the 
historical 
accounts 
of 
Titus 
destroying 
the 
second 
temple 
Ezekiel 
described 
the 
second 
temple 
in 
the 
prophetic 
idiom 
In 
other 
words 
Ezekiel 
described 
a 
temple 
so 
vast 
and 
huge 
that 
it 
could 
never 
be 
constructed 
nor 
was 
it 
intended 
to 
be 
constructed 
according 
to 
his 
description 
It 
was 
a 
vision 
People 
understood 
that 
Absolutely 
It 
is 
a 
description 
of 
the

That 
goes 
without

genres

I 
think 
Well 
here 
s 
a 
warning 
what 
you 
re 
going 
to 
see 
there 
might 
look 
as 
realistic 
in 
form 
as 
a 
Rembrandt 
but 
it 
s 
in 
a 
different 
genre 
that 
uses 
symbolism 
and 
you 
t 
look 
at 
a 
Dali 
the 
same 
way 
you 
look 
at 
a

The 
Messiah 
the 
Prince 
came 
and 
cut 
a 
new 
covenant 
with 
many 
and 
with 
his 
own 
sacrifice 
put 
an 
end 
to 
the 
old 
sacrificial 
system 
and 
his 
body 
was 
an 
atonement 
for 
sin 
Then 
the 
second 
temple 
was 
destroyed 
How 
is 
this 
not 
clear 
The 
Messiah 
is 
the 
Prince 
Why 
are 
you 
waiting 
for 
the 
second 
temple 
to 
be 
destroyed 
No 
you 
do 
not 
take 
the 
bible 
literally 
because 
if 
you 
took 
the 
bible 
literally 
then 
you 
would 
not 
read 
the 
prophetic 
idiom 
like 
the 
encyclopedia 
Internal 
evidence

The

of 
things

Thanks 
for 
the 
offer 
though 
I 
trusted 
a 
teacher 
who 
presented 
this 
bad 
math 
too 
when 
I 
first 
became 
a 
Christian 
When 
I 
realized 
the 
math 
t 
add 
up 
it 
turned 
me 
against 
that 
teacher 
and 
made 
me 
distrust 
everything 
he 
ever 
said 
and 
it 
turns 
out 
it 
was 
one 
of 
his 
lesser 
bits 
of 
misinformation 
Listen 
I 
know 
there 
is 
a 
lot 
of 
bad 
experts 
out 
there 
telling 
you 
that 
Daniel 
s 
prophecy 
adds 
up 
like 
a 
mathematical 
formula 
and 
this 
makes 
a 
great 
apologetic 
tool 
but 
I 
suggest 
not 
lying 
to 
people 
about 
math 
Teach 
them 
doctrine 
then 
the 
prophetic 
genre 
If 
Daniel 
was 
making 
a 
wooden 
point 
he 
would 
have 
said 
years 
but 
he 
t 
Instead 
he 
put 
it 
in 
a 
strange 
way 
made 
up 
exclusively 
in 
terms 
of 
highly 
symbolic 
numbers 
I 
suggest 
doing 
a 
word 
study 
of 
and 
If 
you 
want 
to 
understand 
how 
this 
symbolism 
is 
interpreted 
in 
ancient 
Hebrew 
culture 
then 
I 
suggest 
looking 
at 
a 
non 
canonical 
work 
called 
the 
Book 
of 
Jubilee 
It 
clearly 
shows 
that 
people 
of 
that 
time 
would 
see 
the 
weeks 
in 
terms 
of 
eras 
marked 
by 
creation 
and 
rest 
No 
I 
think 
prophecy 
is 
primarily 
symbolic 
and 
points 
to 
a 
spiritual 
reality 
more 
than 
a 
wooden 
literal 
reality 
In 
prophetic 
terms

not

The 
walls

as 
the 
prophecy 
said 
would 
happen 
The 
city 
was 
already

is 
just 
to 
rebuild 
the 
walls

in

and

of 
the 
Lord 
the 
God 
of 
Israel 
he 
is 
the 
God 
who

Thus 
says 
Cyrus 
king 
of 
Persia 
The 
Lord 
the 
God 
of 
heaven 
has 
given 
me 
all 
the 
kingdoms 
of 
the 
earth 
and 
he 
has 
charged 
me 
to 
build 
him 
a 
house 
at 
Jerusalem 
which 
is 
in 
Judah 
Whoever 
is 
among 
you 
of 
all 
his 
people 
may 
his 
God 
be 
with 
him 
and 
let 
him 
go 
up 
to 
Jerusalem 
In 
the 
first 
year 
of 
Cyrus 
king 
of 
Persia 
that 
the 
word 
of 
the 
Lord 
by 
the 
mouth 
of 
Jeremiah 
might 
be 
fulfilled 
the 
Lord 
stirred 
up 
the 
spirit 
of 
Cyrus 
king 
of 
Persia 
so 
that 
he 
made 
a 
proclamation 
throughout 
all 
his 
kingdom 
and 
also 
put 
it 
in 
writing 
See 
here 
s 
the 
thing 
numbers 
in 
ancient 
cultures 
especially 
in 
Hebrew 
culture 
are 
not 
seen 
as 
modern 
western 
man 
sees 
numbers 
in 
which 
the 
number 
is 
simply 
one 
more 
than 
and 
one 
less 
than 
They 
have 
symbolic 
power 
And 
if 
you 
want 
to 
take 
Jeremiah 
s 
prophecy 
about 
seventy 
years 
captivity 
then 
you 
could 
take 
the 
beginning 
of 
captivity 
at 
BC 
and

and 
get

Well 
the 
captivity 
ended 
in 
BC 
That 
s 
not 
what 
Ezra 
says 
Well 
if 
you 
want 
to 
take 
Daniel 
s 
prophecy 
as 
a 
wooden 
does 
then 
you 
would

the

calling 
you 
a 
hero 
The 
chief 
modern 
rival 
of 
Christianity 
is 
liberalism 
I 
am 
not 
gonna 
argue 
with 
that 
I 
know 
the 
stuff 
you 
re 
saying 
is 
a 
very 
popular 
way 
of 
looking 
at 
prophecy 
today 
but 
I 
sincerely 
believe 
these 
ideas 
are 
spread 
by 
false 
teachers 
who 
come 
up 
with 
sensationalist 
ideas 
to 
sell 
books 
Our 
eschatology 
should 
not 
be 
determined 
by 
newspaper 
clippings 
You 
must 
also 
understand 
that 
the 
prophetic 
idiom 
is 
not 
the 
same 
way 
we 
talk 
with 
our 
friends 
in 
It 
s 
a 
specific 
genre 
with 
a 
specific 
way 
of 
going 
beyond 
the 
mere 
physical 
not 
to 
exaggerate 
like 
a 
fisherman 
describing 
a 
big 
fish 
but 
to 
show 
the 
spiritual 
importance 
Am 
I 
wasting 
my 
time 
talking 
to 
a 
parody 
account 
or 
are 
you 
for 
real 
Are 
you 
kidding 
me 
Please 
give 
up 
on 
the 
methodology 
God 
gives 
a 
promise 
and 
fulfills 
it 
He 
t 
say 
he 
s 
going 
to 
do 
something 
within 
a 
generation 
and 
do 
it 
thousands 
or 
millions 
of 
years 
later 
God 
determines 
it 
to 
show 
His 
power 
All 
this 
talk 
of 
huge 
strings 
of 
unfulfilled 
prophecies 
would 
be 
of 
no 
use 
to 
anyone 
It 
is 
not 
His 
fault 
people 
t 
aware 
of 
history

an 
army

up 
of 
many 
nations

things 
happened

you 
read 
the 
comment 
I 
made 
just 
below 
the 
one 
you 
just 
commented 
on 
Who 
is 
teaching 
you 
to 
read 
prophecy 
Are 
you 
learning 
this 
stuff 
from 
rabbis 
The 
exception 
are 
Messianic 
prophecies 
and 
those 
have 
been 
fulfilled 
Here 
s 
the 
gist 
God 
t 
generally 
give 
prophecies 
that 
are 
an 
insanely 
long 
period 
in 
the 
future 
without 
saying 
something 
like 
seal 
up 
this 
prophecy 
or 
something 
similar 
to 
make 
it 
clear 
that 
it 
is 
a 
long 
time 
away

You 
re 
making 
a 
historical 
argument 
I 
m 
telling 
you 
what 
we 
know 
about 
from 
historical 
records 
Joseph 
lived 
in 
the 
north 
because 
he 
was 
a 
skilled 
craftsman 
working 
on 
a 
building 
project 
His 
ancestral 
home 
was 
in 
the 
south 
However 
most 
of 
Jesus 
neighbors 
would 
have 
been 
from 
the 
tribes 
They 
owned 
the 
lands 
The 
ones 
that 
remained 
were 
intermarried 
with 
the 
pagans 
The 
ones 
who 
left 
returned 
with 
the 
rest 
Who 
do 
you 
think 
Jesus 
neighbors 
were 
From 
a 
quick 
scan 
these 
all 
already 
happened 
What 
s 
your 
issue 
Many 
individuals 
became 
known 
as 
the 
Samaritans 
by 
intermarrying 
I 
asked 
for 
one 
Please 
give 
me 
one 
Now 
don 
t 
point 
me 
to 
something 
written 
during 
the 
Babylonian 
exile 
that 
prophecies 
the 
return 
in 
and 
say 
it 
is 
not 
fulfilled 
Have 
you 
read 
Ezra 
It 
s 
about 
the 
return 
It 
was 
written 
during 
the 
persecutions 
in 
the 
s 
I 
m 
trying 
to 
be 
open 
minded 
but 
I 
am 
not 
sure 
where 
you 
are 
coming 
from 
Could 
you 
please 
name 
one 
of 
the 
supposedly 
hundreds 
of 
unfulfilled 
prophecies 
Most 
of 
Jesus 
disciples 
were 
from 
the 
northern 
tribes 
They 
did 
John 
wrote 
that 
in 
the 
s 
The 
temple 
was 
still 
standing 
then 
That 
s 
a 
dishonorable 
use 
of 
the 
text 
The 
text 
was 
about 
what 
was 
happening 
then 
I 
m 
talking 
about 
the 
nation 
It 
was 
gone 
Certainly 
not 
every 
individual 
of 
the 
nation 
was 
killed 
The 
early 
church 
in 
Jerusalem 
fled 
to 
the 
mountains 
just 
like 
Jesus 
warned 
them 
to 
do 
when 
they 
saw 
the 
armies 
surround 
the 
city 
Are 
you 
asking 
if 
every 
single 
individual 
returned 
then 
no 
Did 
they 
return 
Yes 
Those 
were 
horrible 
events 
but 
what 
happened 
in 
AD 
was 
the 
end 
of 
the 
old 
world 
order 
It 
was 
massive 
I 
don 
t 
know 
what 
you 
mean 
about 
the 
application 
This 
is 
a 
prophecy 
that 
played 
out 
in 
history 
God 
punished 
the 
northern 
kingdom 
who 
were 
captured 
and 
dragged 
off 
Same 
with 
the 
southern 
kingdom 
Israel 
was 
annihilated 
The 
city 
was 
destroyed 
The 
temple 
was 
destroyed 
The 
people 
were 
dragged 
off 
into 
slavery 
Corpses 
were 
left 
with 
burial 
for 
the 
birds 
to 
eat 
The 
country 
no 
longer 
existed 
Yep 
Jeremiah 
is 
all 
about 
offering 
negative 
sanctions 
of 
exile 
with 
one 
hand 
and 
future 
hope 
of 
restoration 
with 
the 
other 
hand 
Ezekiel 
too 
It 
was 
annihilated 
Did 
you 
know 
some 
big 
event 
happened 
in 
AD 
Jeremiah 
is 
talking 
about 
the 
return 
to 
the 
land 
in 
BC 
To 
make 
it 
about 
anything 
else 
is 
to 
not 
honor 
the 
text 
Israel 
return 
What 
are 
you 
talking 
about 
Matthew 
is 
about 
the 
annihilation 
of 
Israel 
Did 
you 
notice 
that 
when 
discussing 
the 
Fig 
Tree 
Christ 
says 
Truly 
I 
say 
to 
you 
this 
generation 
will 
not 
pass 
away 
until 
all 
these 
things 
take 
place 
That 
generation 
already 
passed 
away 
Those 
things 
took 
place 
If 
you 
don 
t 
see 
that 
maybe 
you 
are 
misinterpreting 
it 
Simple 
Jeremiah 
wrote 
about 
the 
return 
of 
the 
people 
from 
Babylonian 
exile 
and 
that 
occurred 
in 
BC 
My 
point 
is 
you 
re 
now 
sounding 
like 
a 
Native 
Twitter 
has 
gone 
ablaze 
as 
a 
Native 
American 
elder 
singing 
the 
AIM 
Song 
in 
Washington 
DC 
during 
the 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
March 
was 
ridiculed 
taunted 
and 
mocked 
by 
a 
group 
of 
non 
Native 
youth 
t 
co 
it 
s 
actually 
a 
pretty 
cool 
chant 
that 
is 
pretty 
popular 
Indian 
Country 
Today 
also 
confirmed 
that 
it 
s 
the 
AIM 
chant 
The 
elder 
was 
likely 
part 
of 
that 
movement 
and 
I 
am 
not 
just 
speculating 
The 
song 
he 
s 
chanting 
is 
the 
AIM 
chant 
AIM 
was 
the 
group 
dedicated 
to 
provocation 
for 
media 
coverage 
Perhaps 
they 
changed 
their 
approach 
in 
more 
recent 
times 
but 
I 
m 
guessing 
not 
I 
got 
an 
MA 
in 
colonial 
history 
with 
a 
focus 
on 
Native 
studies 
but 
we 
learned 
about 
more 
contemporary 
issues 
and 
I 
hate 
to 
say 
it 
but 
a 
lot 
of 
the 
s 
era 
activism 
was 
aimed 
at 
taking 
real 
issues 
and 
provoking 
potentially 
violent 
confrontations 
for 
media 
coverage 
God 
question 
And 
was 
the 
Apocrypha 
given 
by 
inspiration 
of 
God 
when 
it 
was 
being 
translated 
for 
the 
Listen 
I 
thought 
you 
wanted 
a 
non 
translation 
but 
the 
translators 
kept 
a 
lot 
of 
the 
Vulgate 
s 
mistakes 
because 
they 
were 
popular 
misconceptions 
Not 
my 
problem 
The 
first 
reports 
I 
heard 
made 
it 
out 
like 
they 
were 
a 
roving 
pack 
of 
street 
looking 
to 
start 
stuff 
but 
then 
I 
saw 
a 
video 
of 
what 
looks 
like 
kids 
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
waiting 
for 
their 
school 
bus 
to 
pick 
them 
up 
to 
leave 
the 
March 
for 
Life 
event 
Are 
you 
that 
attached 
to 
the 
Latin 
Vulgate 
Although 
it 
cleaned 
up 
some 
of 
the 
more 
obvious 
issues 
e 
g 
the 
Jeremiah 
vs 
Epistle 
of 
the 
Hebrews 
covenant 
vs 
testament 
distinction 
the 
translators 
did 
not 
go 
far 
enough 
I 
m 
guessing 
it 
would 
have 
ruffled 
of 
the 
feathers 
of 
some 
of 
the 
Anglican 
liturgical 
ceremonies 
The 
translation 
team 
was 
apparently 
more 
interested 
in 
maintaining 
the 
continuity 
of 
this 
bad 
translation 
than 
have 
coherent 
continuity 
within 
scripture 
It 
was 
a 
bad 
call 
is 
where 
the 
phrase 
New 
Testament 
that 
we 
use 
in 
everyday 
discussion 
today 
for 
speaking 
of 
Christian 
books 
of 
our 
Bible 
It 
is 
based 
on 
a 
bad 
translation 
of 
the 
New 
Covenant 
that 
became 
so 
widely 
accepted 
that 
it 
can 
t 
possibly 
be 
done 
away 
with 
Another 
example 
when 
the 
Vulgate 
translated 
Jeremiah 
it 
uses 
the 
word 
for 
the 
covenant 
but 
when 
the 
Jeremiah 
passage 
is 
quoted 
in 
the 
th 
chapter 
of 
the 
Epistle 
to 
the 
Hebrews 
it 
uses 
the 
or 
more 
specifically 
When 
translating 
the 
Greek 
the 
translators 
preferred 
even 
when 
referring 
to 
things 
in 
the 
OT 
it 
previously 
translated 
as 
For 
instance 
circumcision 
was 
a 
sign 
of 
the 
in 
the 
NT 
and 
in 
the 
OT 
It 
thus 
created 
a 
false 
discontinuity 
The 
error 
likely 
stems 
from 
an 
over 
reliance 
on 
the 
Vulgate 
who 
were 
the 
first 
to 
introduce 
this 
covenant 
testament 
distinction 
in 
translating 
the 
Hebrew 
and 
Greek

What

Check 
your

Did

with

being

The

way 
of

not

When 
do 
you 
believe 
the 
pause 
started 
That 
s 
a 
problem 
if 
you 
want 
to 
understand 
scripture 
There 
is 
no 
consistency 
The 
was 
made 
up 
of 
translation 
teams 
Some 
apparently 
preferred 
one 
word 
over 
the 
other 
but 
the 
end 
result 
of 
their 
team 
effort 
is 
a 
product 
of 
confusion 
To 
be 
completely 
honest 
I 
don 
t 
know 
how 
this 
is 
even 
up 
for 
debate 
unless 
you 
mistake 
the 
end 
for 
the 
end 
of 
the 
universe 
which 
is 
a 
big 
big 
big 
interpretive 
mistake 
During 
the 
Babylonian 
exile 
we 
had 
specific 
prophecy 
about 
the 
return 
and 
when 
it 
would 
occur 
Not 
so 
with 
If 
I 
t 
understand 
how 
covenants 
work 
I 
might 
confused 
by 
it 
but 
then 
we 
d 
have 
to 
change 
the 
meaning 
of 
everlasting 
There 
is 
no 
gap 
The 
temple 
was 
destroyed 
If 
it 
is 
a 
testament 
it 
changes 
nothing 
other 
than 
to 
confuse 
people 
by 
introducing 
a 
weird 
translation 
What 
is 
a 
testament 
A 
covenant 
What 
is 
a 
feature 
of 
a 
covenant 
Continuity 
What 
does 
a 
testament 
provide 
Continuity 
of 
inheritance 
to 
an 
elected 
people 
So 
God 
promised 
them 
to 
multiply 
and 
enter 
the 
land 
of 
Canaan 
Then 
there 
s 
this 
part 
about 
possessing 
it 
which 
historically 
did 
not 
happen 
I 
understand 
why 
that 
t 
happen 
It 
relates 
to 
understanding 
the 
nature 
of 
covenant 
By 
all 
means 
advance 
your 
case 
but 
I 
suggest 
not 
working 
backwards 
from 
a 
English 
translation 
to 
the 
Greek 
where 
you 
might 
get 
tripped 
up 
by 
a 
word 
that 
is 
similar 
in 
the 
English 
translation 
but 
not 
related 
in 
the 
Greek 
I 
am 
the 
one 
talking 
about 
Daniel 
I 
don 
t 
think 
Mark 
said 
anything 
about 
it 
All 
these 
texts 
work 
together 
Christ 
is 
the 
one 
who 
brought 
the 
new 
covenant 
He 
established 
the 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
the 
covenant 
that 
Daniel 
said 
would 
be 
cut 
just 
prior 
to 
being 
cut 
off 
himself 
Christ 
refers 
to 
this 
explicitly 
in 
Matthew 
He 
claimed 
to 
be 
that 
Messiah 
who 
would 
cut 
a 
new 
covenant 
with 
the 
many 
and 
be 
cut 
off 
to 
seemingly 
have 
nothing 
and 
then 
the 
temple 
would 
be 
destroyed 
Now 
compare 
this 
Mat 
to 
Daniel 
about 
the 
Messiah 
cutting 
a 
new 
covenant 
with 
many 
for 
the 
forgiveness 
of 
sin 
prior 
to 
being 
cut 
off 
and 
the 
temple 
being 
destroyed 
And 
he 
gave 
him 
the 
covenant 
k 
n 
of 
circumcision 
Acts 
for 
this 
is 
my 
blood 
of 
the 
covenant 
k 
s 
which 
is 
poured 
out 
for 
many 
for 
the 
forgiveness 
of 
sins 
Matthew 
Do 
you 
have 
any 
evidence 
that 
the 
Greek 
word 
for 
testimony 
was 
used 
during 
the 
last 
supper 
or 
is 
it 
always 
the 
Greek 
word 
for 
covenant 
If 
that 
s 
not 
what 
you 
re 
saying 
then 
why 
bring 
up 
Revelation 
It 
s 
a 
different 
word 
Perhaps 
I 
am 
missing 
your 
point 
Could 
you 
do 
me 
a 
favor 
and 
tell 
where 
the 
unconditional 
covenant 
with 
Jacob 
is 
mentioned 
You 
been 
saying 
that 
the 
word 
for 
a 
person 
s 
account 
means 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
the 
word 
for 
covenant 
when 
you 
feel 
like 
that 
s 
how 
you 
want 
to 
interpret 
it 
When 
the 
NT 
refers 
to 
it 
though 
So 
would 
you 
say 
when 
male 
kids 
were 
circumcised 
it 
was 
a 
sign 
of 
a 
testimony 
When 
Christ 
refers 
to 
the 
Lord 
s 
supper 
he 
uses 
the 
word 
k 
for 
covenant 
It 
is 
the 
same 
word 
for 
what 
was 
delivered 
to 
Abraham 
and 
Moses 
Josh 
showed 
me 
that 
a 
testimony 
is 
not 
the 
same 
as 
a 
covenant 
but 
nobody 
thought 
they 
were 
since 
the 
NT 
writers 
used 
two 
different 
words 
for 
each 
Future 
So 
we 
live 
in 
the 
new 
testament 
not 
the 
new 
covenant 
even 
though 
they 
are 
exactly 
the 
same 
word 
Very 
clever 
Rev 
is 
not 
referring 
to 
covenant 
k 
It 
refers 
to 
a 
testimony 
It 
is 
where 
we 
get 
the 
word 
martyr 
Why 
t 
the 
writers 
of 
the 
NT 
distinguish 
Paul 
was 
known 
for 
inventing 
a 
new 
word 
when 
the 
occasion 
called 
for 
it 
Why 
not 
here 
So 
there 
is 
no 
new 
covenant 
if 
the 
only 
translates 
the 
word 
for 
covenant 
as 
testament 
The 
IF 
is 
all 
the 
believing 
ones 
Same 
word 
It 
is 
not 
the 
best 
translation 
but 
it 
is 
fine 
as 
long 
as 
you 
speak 
of 
an 
testament 
and 
a 
Mosaic 
testament 
and 
a 
testament 
etc 
It 
is 
not 
an 
either 
or 
A 
will 
is 
a 
covenant 
Look 
to 
Daniel 
who 
said 
the 
messiah 
would 
cut 
a 
new 
covenant 
with 
many 
and 
be 
cut 
off 
Testament 
is 
a 
double 
word 
play 
because 
it 
had 
to 
do 
with 
Christ 
s 
death 
but 
it 
is 
still 
a 
covenant 
It 
is 
the 
same 
word 
in 
the 
Greek 
I 
can 
tell 
you 
this 
without 
a 
survey 
They 
leave 
because 
they 
don 
t 
believe 
in 
Jesus 
Please 
stop 
placing 
blame 
on 
other 
Yep 
This 
is 
devastating 
blow 
for 
the 
position 
that 
holds 
the 
New 
Covenant 
is 
some 
futuristic 
exclusively 
Jewish 
thing

This 
Guy 
Spent 
Years 
Growing 
A 
Church 
From 
Trees 
t 
co 
I 
bet 
they 
do 
not 
hire 
Muslims 
to 
teach 
their 
Christian 
religious 
courses 
too 
I 
am 
literally 
shaking 
Why 
The 
author 
to 
the 
Hebrews 
said 
all 
that 
was 
passing 
away 
And 
why 
did 
Paul 
preach 
the 
kingdom 
in 
Acts 
I 
keep 
asking 
you 
this 
but 
you 
never 
answer 
It 
is 
kind 
of 
odd 
Jesus 
preached 
the 
temple 
would 
be 
destroyed 
In 
other 
words 
the 
truth 
changes 
for 
different 
ethnic 
groups 
So 
depending 
on 
the 
ethnicity 
of 
the 
person 
you 
are 
talking 
to 
Acts 
goes 
up 
about 
or 
I 
believe 
Paul 
was 
beheaded 
a 
few 
years 
later 
That 
is 
not 
a 
big 
window 
You 
said 
Peter 
John 
and 
James 
led 
the 
churches 
in 
Asia 
astray 
right 
Both 
were 
written 
around 
the 
same 
time 
s 
So 
Peter 
and 
James 
and 
John 
are 
in 
hell 
for 
spreading 
a 
false 
gospel 
You 
call 
us 
cold 
because 
we 
hold 
to 
election 
but 
your 
narrow 
warped 
definition 
of 
the 
gospel 
is 
held 
by 
so 
few 
people 
that 
you 
end 
up 
sending 
more 
people 
to 
hell 
then 
the 
most 
cage 
stage 
Calvinist 
You 
are 
being 
evasive 
You 
have 
made 
it 
clear 
that 
virtually 
all 
churches 
do 
not 
have 
the 
true 
gospel 
so 
they 
t 
saved 
Heaven 
must 
be 
roomy 
Who 
had 
the 
true 
gospel 
in 
the 
th 
century 
Not 
joking 
Virtually 
all 
Christians 
are 
repulsed 
by 
your 
theology 
and 
your 
understanding 
of 
the 
gospel 
You 
would 
consider 
them 
all 
to 
be 
mixing 
law 
and 
gospel 
and 
worthy 
of 
hellfire 
Since 
people 
have 
not 
arrived 
any 
where 
close 
to 
you 
until 
very 
recently 
and 
there 
might 
be 
a 
thousand 
people 
who 
agree 
with 
you 
then 
most 
Christians 
since 
the 
beginning 
have 
not 
believed 
what 
you 
consider 
to 
be 
the 
true 
gospel 
They 
are 
in 
hell 
correct 
Your 
definition 
of 
the 
gospel 
has 
been 
held 
by 
less 
then 
a 
thousand 
people 
of 
Christians 
reject 
your 
view 
of 
Paul 
s 
theology 
including 
Paul 
himself 
If 
you 
are 
right 
Paul 
is 
in 
hell 
Nobody 
thought 
anything 
remotely 
close 
to 
until 
very 
recently 
and 
if 
is 
the 
gospel 
then 
of 
Christians 
are 
in 
hell 
Nobody 
thinks 
it 
is 
much 
older 
then 
Darby 
Darby 
is 
too 
moderate 
for 
you 
guys 
Of 
course 
you 
think 
every 
Lutheran 
Calvinist 
eastern 
orthodox 
methodist 
baptist 
etc 
etc 
etc 
all 
had 
a 
false 
gospel 
and 
were 
damned 
Even 
during 
the 
reign 
of 
Constantine 
at 
the 
church 
at 
Jerusalem 
Charles 
Caldwell 
Seriously 
no 
Christian 
thought 
anywhere 
remotely 
close 
to 
you 
until 
less 
than 
a 
century 
ago 
Is 
that 
when 
heaven 
opened 
up 
the 
gate 
for 
the 
first 
time 
since 
the 
first 
century 
Well 
you 
do 
not 
think 
anyone 
in 
the 
early 
church 
did 
You 
do 
not 
anyone 
in 
the 
Roman 
church 
did 
nor 
eastern 
church 
nor 
reformation 
So 
when 
did 
people 
start 
going 
to 
heaven 
You 
act 
like 
everyone 
went 
to 
hell 
until 
mid 
Acts 
came 
around 
Not 
true 
God 
will 
judge 
his 
heart 
If 
it 
turns 
out 
that 
he 
never 
converted 
then 
he 
did 
great 
things 
for 
the 
church 
by 
legalizing 
our 
faith 
It 
was 
an 
answer 
to 
many 
prayers 
Silly 
people 
say 
that 
He 
professed 
faith 
He 
made 
life 
much 
better 
for 
Christians 
He 
built 
churches 
Squashed 
heresies 
You 
call 
him 
a 
pagan 
like 
you 
know 
any 
thing 
We 
also 
know 
he 
professed 
Christ 
and 
was 
baptized 
and 
you 
question 
his 
faith 
I 
do 
not 
know 
where 
you 
get 
that 
right 
You 
assume 
he 
t 
but 
you 
have 
no 
evidence 
All 
we 
have 
to 
look 
at 
is 
his 
works 
which 
are 
a 
million 
times 
greater 
than 
yours 
And 
you 
judge 
him 
based 
on 
your 
prejudice 
Where 
did 
Mr 
Easy 
go 
Now 
you 
are 
inspecting 
fruit 
and 
calling 
people 
out 
as 
false 
converts 
Funny 
how 
things 
change 
Christians 
controlled 
the 
region 
Just 
admit 
that 
you 
misspoke 
but 
I 
just 
anticipate 
you 
digging 
your 
feet 
in 
further 
Did 
you 
conjure 
up 
their 
souls 
from 
the 
afterlife 
and 
figure 
that 
out 
It 
most 
certainly 
was 
a 
passion 
for 
Christ 
You 
re 
deflecting 
again 
I 
can 
t 
picture 
you 
walking 
across 
the 
street 
to 
build 
a 
church 
Those 
people 
traveled 
across 
nations 
out 
of 
love 
and 
you 
want 
to 
judge 
them 
like 
you 
re 
more 
spiritual 
then 
them 
You 
don 
t 
know 
anything 
about 
them 
Look 
at 
the 
passion 
they 
had 
for 
Christ 
compared 
to 
you 
who 
won 
t 
even 
get 
into 
a 
vehicle 
and 
drive 
to 
church 
You 
re 
deflecting 
again 
So 
unbelieving 
gentiles 
knocked 
down 
unbelieving 
gentile 
temples 
to 
build 
churches 
for 
other 
unbelieving 
gentiles 
In 
what 
world 
does 
that 
make 
sense 
Now 
who 
was 
in 
control 
of 
Jerusalem 
The

at

A 
significant 
wave 
of 
Christian 
immigration 
to 
the 
city 
begins 
This

the 
date 
on 
which 
the 
city

generally 
taken 
to

been 
renamed

Constantine

Within 
a 
few 
months 
the 
First 
Council 
of 
first 
worldwide 
Christian 
council 
confirms 
status 
of 
as 
a 
patriarchate 
Who 
controlled 
it 
then 
Given 
their 
own 
idolatry 
it 
is 
no 
wonder 
they 
did 
not 
succeed 
Let 
me 
help 
you 
out 
while 
you 
go 
off 
into 
a 
totally 
different 
tangent 
the 
Crusades 
were 
about 
RETAKING 
Jerusalem 
They 
had 
it 
They 
lost 
it 
It 
was 
under 
their 
control 
Rome 
let 
the 
Muslims 
take 
it 
because 
they 
had 
a 
beef 
with 
the 
Byzantines 
Byzantine 
Empire 
What 
do 
you 
think 
the 
Crusades 
were 
about 
It 
was 
Christian 
land 
They 
planted 
churches 
They 
went 
on 
pilgrimages 
to 
it 
It 
was 
theirs 
Your 
endless 
string 
of 
unfulfilled 
prophecies 
is 
ridiculous 
You 
re 
one 
degree 
of 
separation 
of 
still 
waiting 
for 
the 
Messiah 
to 
be 
born 
You 
can 
t 
even 
seem 
to 
resolve 
the 
issue 
without 
creating 
more 
issues 
I 
m 
not 
going 
to 
let 
you 
forget 
this 
You 
have 
solved 
nothing 
In 
fact 
it 
is 
a 
very 
clear 
illustration 
about 
how 
bankrupt 
your 
system 
is 
when 
it 
is 
forced 
to 
take 
in 
all 
the 
words 
instead 
of 
skip 
over 
them 
There 
are 
earthly 
repercussions 
for 
sin 
Now 
don 
t 
change 
the 
subject 
The 
Church 
controlled 
that 
land 
for 
quite 
some 
time 
That 
s 
why 
there 
are 
super 
old 
churches 
there 
If 
you 
re 
not 
part 
of 
God 
s 
people 
then 
you 
re 
damned 
The 
apostle 
John 
wrote 
during 
the 
tribulation 
Or 
why 
Paul 
spoke 
about 
the 
Kingdom 
to 
gentiles 
Or 
why 
Paul 
taught 
baptism 
to 
gentiles 
Or 
why 
the 
Church 
is 
called 
terms 
normally 
applied 
to 
Israel 
Or 
why 
the 
Church 
brought 
YAHWEH 
s 
name 
to 
the 
world 
and 
not 
Israel 
You 
haven 
t 
explained 
why 
church 
discipline 
hearings 
two 
or 
three 
witness 
is 
the 
same 
exact 
formula 
as 
Israel 
s 
legal 
proceedings 
Or 
why 
Paul 
told 
Christian 
children 
to 
obey 
the 
fifth 
commandment 
Or 
why 
the 
Church 
had 
the 
same 
responsibility 
to 
care 
for 
widows 
as 
Israel 
And 
do 
not 
presume 
to 
say 
to 
yourselves 
We 
have 
Abraham 
as 
our 
father 
for 
I 
tell 
you 
God 
is 
able 
from 
these 
stones 
to 
raise 
up 
children 
for 
Abraham 
But 
you 
have 
a 
false 
sense 
of 
clarity 
based 
on 
ignoring 
continuity 
We 
illustrated 
this 
time 
and 
time 
again 
Just 
from 
the 
other 
day 
you 
still 
haven 
t 
explained 
why 
Paul 
taught 
former 
pagans 
to 
partake 
in 
the 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
when 
it 
is 
supposed 
to 
be 
for 
the 
Jewish 
Who 
here 
is 
a 
gentile 
What 
promises 
The 
Church 
already 
did 
take 
over 
that 
land 
Idolatry 
became 
widespread 
and 
God 
sent 
the 
Muslims 
to 
punish 
them 
Sound 
familiar 
Yeah 
that 
s 
what 
God 
did 
to 
Israel 
with 
Babylon 
That 
s 
what 
God 
does 
to 
the 
Church 
If 
the 
Church 
is 
not 
chosen 
then 
it 
is 
damned 
perhaps 
My 
knee 
jerk 
reaction 
is 
to 
worry 
that 
it 
blurs 
the 
creator 
creature 
distinction 
but 
I 
suppose 
there 
could 
be 
a 
case 
for 
that 
view 
under 
a 
headship 
approach 
What 
benefit 
implications 
does 
it 
have 
Are 
you 
asking 
about 
the 
traditional 
Talmudic 
interpretation 
of 
the 
Godhead 
It 
matters 
a 
great 
deal 
to 
your 
boy 
Knox 
It 
s 
the 
basis 
of 
everything 
he 
s 
saying 
was 
has 
I 
m 
not 
denying 
what 
you 
re 
accusing 
me 
of 
denying 
God 
elects 
His 
people 
He 
was 
one 
people 
The 
administration 
can 
change 
forms 
The 
manner 
of 
fulfillment 
can 
change 
forms 
but 
there 
s 
one 
people 
of 
God 
Israel 
was 
a 
continuation 
of 
a 
continuation 
of 
a 
continuation 
Some 
people 
get 
cut 
off 
along 
the 
way 
Okay 
so 
why 
interpret 
every 
reference 
to 
the 
Godhead 
as 
being 
a 
reference 
to 
the 
Father 
alone 
I 
m 
talking 
about 
Christ 
I 
am 
led 
to 
guess 
that 
s 
what 
you 
believe 
because 
your 
boy 
Knox 
apparently 
just 
sees 
any 
reference 
to 
God 
and 
assumes 
that 
it 
is 
about 
the 
Father 
I 
m 
sorry 
but 
your 
system 
has 
you 
going 
into 
grotesque 
places 
I 
m 
not 
talking 
about 
the 
bride 
metaphor 
I 
m 
talking 
about 
what 
you 
do 
to 
the 
Trinity 
Do 
you 
guys 
even 
believe 
the 
second 
person 
of 
the 
Trinity 
existed 
prior 
to 
the 
incarnation 
Christ 
is 
true 
Israel 
In 
order 
to 
understand 
this 
point 
you 
need 
to 
stop 
thinking 
like 
a 
modern 
westerner 
trying 
to 
do 
a 
crude 
mathematical 
equation 
Paraphrase 
You 
can 
t 
have 
Israel 
married 
to 
the 
father 
and 
the 
church 
married 
to 
Christ 
and 
have 
the 
church 
be 
Israel 
because 
you 
can 
t 
have 
one 
bride 
married 
to 
a 
father 
and 
His 
son 
that 
s 
gross 
Not 
at 
all 
What 
I 
hear 
when 
you 
say 
Israel 
and 
the 
Church 
is 
not 
an 
apparently 
obvious 
statement 
I 
hear 
the 
implications 
that 
you 
draw 
from 
it 
You 
are 
putting 
the 
Trinity 
into 
Civil 
War 
Why 
is 
it 
so 
unbelievable 
that 
someone 
can 
understand 
the 
argument 
and 
not 
agree 
with 
it 
The 
man 
believes 
in 
weird 
living 
on 
different 
planet 
stuff 
It 
is 
not 
even 
close 
to 
credible 
I 
haven 
t 
made 
myself 
suffer 
through 
listening 
to 
your 
boy 
Knox 
much 
but 
he 
is 
definitely 
scripture 
His 
view 
of 
the 
Trinity 
is 
warped 
to 
put 
it 
nicely 
Listen 
closely 
to 
what 
he 
says 
he 
has 
Christ 
s 
mission 
and 
the 
Father 
s 
mission 
to 
be 
totally 
distinct 
Christ 
says 
that 
scripture 
is 
about 
him 
not 
Israel 
Your 
of 
scripture 
is 
incredibly 
concerning 
So 
the 
point 
of 
scripture 
is 
not 
really 
about 
Christ 
it 
s 
about 
Israel 
Got 
it 
John 
Releases 
First 
Children 
s 
Book 
Goodnight 
Blood 
Moon 
It 
is 
a 
simple 
question 
Do 
you 
own 
it 
So 
you 
do 
not 
disagree 
with 
the 
assessment 
It 
was 
not 
a 
compliment 
This 
is 
why 
people 
say 
you 
have 
an 
method 
Thank 
you 
Someone 
needed 
to 
ask 
it 
But 
won 
t 
they 
be 
discouraged 
when 
they 
realize 
he 
makes 
stuff 
up 
with 
a 
straight 
face 
t 
co 
He 
s 
going 
for 
in 
the 
title 
alone 
before 
he 
even 
says 
a 
word 
Then 
he 
immediately 
goes 
into 
rapture 
fever 
Please 
why 
Why 
Why 
He 
thinks 
that 
people 
who 
do 
not 
hold 
to 
a 
view 
of 
scripture 
believe 
that 
the 
church 
is 
the 
physical 
seed 
of 
Abraham 
Why 
is 
he 
saying 
these 
things 
Who 
takes 
him 
seriously 
I 
m 
not 
being 
I 
sincerely 
with 
all 
my 
heart 
believe 
that 
you 
are 
completely 
wrong 
on 
this 
subject 
Your 
video 
has 
a 
strong 
start 
if 
the 
goal 
is 
to 
make 
stuff 
up 
Please 
find 
another 
teacher 
I 
don 
t 
get 
why 
a 
supposed 
Christian 
has 
the 
same 
hermeneutic 
as 
a 
Jewish 
Nationalist 
who 
can 
t 
understand 
the 
difference 
between 
bloodline 
and 
covenant 
So 
when 
you 
think 
about 
the 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
your 
mind 
goes 
straight 
to 
Israel 
This 
is 
why 
you 
are 
accused 
of 
being 
rather 
the 
Do 
you 
feel 
yourself 
unworthy 
of 
the 
promise 
because 
of 
your 
bloodline 
Well 
let 
me 
share 
the 
gospel 
with 
you 
You 
too 
can 
partake 
in 
the 
covenant 
of 
promise 
regardless 
of 
your 
bloodline 
The 
message 
of 
the 
Jewish 
messiah 
is 
going 
out 
to 
the 
whole 
world 
All 
to 
the 
glory 
of 
God 
Before 
the 
great 
commission 
non 
Jews 
were 
strangers 
to 
the 
covenants 
of 
promise 
having 
no 
hope 
and 
without 
God 
in 
the 
world 
and 
now 
you 
know 
about 
YAHWEH 
but 
you 
wish 
to 
remain 
a 
stranger 
to 
the 
covenant 
of 
promise 
Does 
that 
seem 
odd 
If 
you 
guys 
are 
going 
to 
make 
some 
big 
distinction 
between 
the 
same 
Greek 
word 
k 
whether 
it 
should 
be 
translated 
as 
testament 
or 
covenant 
then 
you 
guys 
should 
figure 
out 
which 
applies 
to 
this 
dispensation 
and 
which 
is 
just 
for 
the 
Jewish 
Paul 
our 
sufficiency 
is 
from 
God 
who 
has 
made 
us 
sufficient 
to 
be 
ministers 
of 
a 
new 
covenant 
not 
of 
the 
letter 
but 
of 
the 
Spirit 
You 
re 
on 
the 
outside 
The 
lamb 
that 
takes 
away 
sin 
What 
s 
that 
about 
What 
about 
Adam 
Was 
a 
he 
a 
Jew 
as 
well 
You 
got 
some 
bad 
sources 
Was 
Noah 
a 
Jew 
A 
son 
of 
Abraham 
Then 
go 
back 
to 
Daniel 
The 
Messiah 
would 
form 
a 
New 
Covenant 
with 
many 
and 
be 
cut 
off 
You 
sacrifice 
an 
animal 
for 
a 
covenant 
You 
spill 
its 
blood 
and 
you 
eat 
its 
flesh 
Where 
have 
I 
heard 
that 
before 
Oh 
yeah 
the 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
What 
do 
you 
think 
a 
covenant 
involved 
The 
death 
of 
an 
animal 
It 
s 
the 
same 
word 
in 
Greek 
Same 
word 
dude 
Surely 
you 
feel 
the 
weight 
of 
this 
issue 
on 
your 
entire 
system 
I 
suggest 
giving 
it 
some 
serious 
thought 
and 
prayer 
Why 
Is 
this 
the 
New 
Covenant 
that 
is 
interesting 
t 
it 
Is 
that 
your 
argument 
for 
not 
obeying 
a 
specific 
command 
from 
our 
LORD 
and 
from 
your 
favorite 
Apostle 
So 
did 
Christ 
return 
and 
that 
justifies 
not 
practicing 
the 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
Did 
Paul 
forget 
that 
it 
was 
just 
supposed 
to 
be 
a 
Jewish 
thing 
like 
you 
said 
Paul 
apparently 
t 
as 
good 
at 
rightly 
dividing 
as 
you 
are 
Nope 
but 
there 
s 
continuity 
between 
what 
Christ 
said 
to 
the 
and 
what 
Paul 
told 
the 
former 
pagans 
in 
Corinth 
So 
even 
if 
Paul 
s 
letters 
are 
flawed 
i 
e 
not 
infallible 
by 
the 
misconception 
of 
when 
Christ 
would 
return 
it 
would 
not 
explain 
why 
he 
was 
spreading 
the 
practice 
among 
non 
Jews 
You 
got 
a 
problem 
any 
way 
you 
look 
at 
it 
You 
said 
that 
gentiles 
should 
not 
be 
participating 
in 
the 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
because 
they 
are 
not 
part 
of 
the 
New 
Covenant 
because 
the 
NC 
is 
only 
for 
Jews 
Why 
is 
Paul 
spreading 
it 
to 
the 
gentiles 
We 
are 
told 
perform 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
New 
Covenant 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
from 
the 
time 
of 
the 
Last 
Supper 
until 
he 
returns 
If 
gentiles 
were 
doing 
things 
they 
should 
not 
have 
been 
doing 
Paul 
would 
have 
freaked 
out 
and 
said 
something 
like 
I 
wish 
they 
drank 
themselves 
to 
death 
So 
Paul 
was 
telling 
Jewish 
women 
to 
act 
modest 
like 
Jews 
but 
he 
forgot 
to 
make 
that 
known 
in 
his 
letter 
that 
it 
was 
just 
for 
the 
Jewish 
women 
Your 
method 
makes 
not 
sense 
You 
said 
the 
New 
Covenant 
is 
for 
Jews 
only 
and 
the 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
is 
a 
sign 
of 
the 
New 
Covenant 
and 
Paul 
taught 
the 
former 
pagans 
to 
observe 
it 
How 
does 
that 
make 
sense 
So 
Paul 
was 
a 
because 
you 
think 
some 
Jews 
were 
in 
Corinth 
where 
was 
Paul 
to 
call 
Paul 
out 
for 
being 
a 
hypocrite 
like 
Paul 
did 
to 
Peter 
You 
re 
not 
making 
sense 
According 
to 
you 
Paul 
would 
be 
the 
former 
pagans 
by 
telling 
them 
to 
observe 
the 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
So 
why 
did 
Paul 
teach 
the 
former 
pagans 
in 
Corinth 
to 
observe 
it 
Why 
The 
New 
Covenant 
is 
the 
post 
resurrection 
administration 
of 
God 
s 
covenant 
that 
was 
announced 
first 
to 
the 
Jews 
and 
then 
to 
the 
gentiles 
That 
s 
what 
Christ 
told 
the 
That 
s 
what 
Christ 
told 
Paul 
to 
tell 
the 
church 
You 
can 
t 
process 
this 
information 
because 
your 
slogan 
won 
t 
let 
it 
compute 
Paul 
taught 
them 
to 
observe 
it 
Paul 
taught 
them 
it 
is 
a 
sign 
of 
the 
New 
Covenant 
He 
said 
we 
should 
celebrate 
it 
for 
the 
same 
reasons 
Jesus 
told 
the 
to 
celebrate 
it 
Address 
this 
issue 
And 
you 
still 
haven 
t 
explained 
why 
Paul 
was 
teaching 
the 
former 
pagans 
to 
observe 
the 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
Yes 
yes 
I 
know 
they 
were 
all 
Jewish 
but 
Christ 
said 
the 
supper 
should 
be 
practiced 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
the 
New 
Covenant 
until 
he 
returns 
not 
after 
You 
guys 
need 
to 
have 
meeting 
and 
figure 
out 
what 
is 
going 
on 
with 
the 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
a 
sign 
of 
the 
New 
Covenant 
is 
being 
practiced 
in 
a 
dispensation 
that 
it 
t 
be 
practiced 
in 
and 
why 
Paul 
was 
practicing 
it 
in 
Corinth 
among 
former 
pagans 
It 
s 
all 
very 
strange 
But 
that 
s 
for 
the 
New 
Covenant 
after 
all 
the 
Christians 
get 
beamed 
out 
and 
the 
world 
goes 
full 
Nicolas 
Cage 
and 
the 
Jews 
start 
New 
Covenant 
What 
s 
going 
on 
Do 
you 
celebrate 
the 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
Don 
t 
go 
full 
Nicolas 
Cage 
t 
co 
I 
m 
sorry 
but 
I 
m 
not 
going 
to 
let 
this 
go 
You 
have 
to 
deal 
with 
it 
Well 
obviously 
you 
want 
to 
deflect 
with 
jokes 
but 
when 
you 
get 
some 
time 
give 
it 
some 
thought 
What 
are 
you 
talking 
about 
If 
Jesus 
told 
the 
to 
do 
it 
and 
Paul 
told 
the 
non 
Hebrews 
to 
do 
it 
and 
it 
is 
a 
sign 
of 
the 
New 
Covenant 
then 
what 
on 
earth 
are 
you 
talking 
about 
the 
New 
Covenant 
being 
a 
futuristic 
Jewish 
only 
thing 
And 
none 
of 
that 
got 
through 
to 
you 
It 
s 
just 
bouncing 
off 
you 
like 
nothing 
Paul 
said 
to 
put 
on 
the 
full 
armor 
of 
God 
not 
the 
full 
armor 
of 
Thanks 
for 
supporting 
my 
point 
I 
m 
still 
lost 
Did 
I 
lead 
you 
to 
believe 
that 
some 
country 
called 
Israel 
did 
not 
exist 
as 
a 
geopolitical 
entity 
I 
never 
said 
that 
This 
single 
illustration 
alone 
should 
put 
an 
end 
to 
your 
weird 
futuristic 
divisions 
and 
prove 
conclusively 
once 
and 
for 
all 
that 
mid 
Acts 
does 
not 
rightly 
divide 
Paul 
was 
writing 
to 
the 
church 
about 
performing 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
New 
Covenant 
The 
former 
pagan 
non 
Hebrews 
living 
in 
Corinth 
participated 
in 
it 
The 
Hebrew 
Christians 
participated 
in 
it 
It 
is 
a 
sign 
of 
what 
binds 
us 
all 
together 
in 
the 
New 
Covenant 
In 
the 
same 
way 
also 
he 
took 
the 
cup 
after 
supper 
saying 
This 
cup 
is 
the 
new 
covenant 
in 
my 
blood 
Do 
this 
as 
often 
as 
you 
drink 
it 
in 
remembrance 
of 
me 
For 
as 
often 
as 
you 
eat 
this 
bread 
and 
drink 
the 
cup 
you 
proclaim 
the 
Lord 
s 
death 
until 
he 
comes 
Paul 
writes 
For 
I 
received 
from 
the 
Lord 
what 
I 
also 
delivered 
to 
you 
that 
the 
Lord 
Jesus 
on 
the 
night 
when 
he 
was 
betrayed 
took 
bread 
and 
when 
he 
had 
given 
thanks 
he 
broke 
it 
and 
said 
This 
is 
my 
body 
which 
is 
for 
you 
Do 
this 
in 
remembrance 
of 
me 
This 
makes 
it 
crystal 
clear 
the 
continuity 
between 
Jesus 
message 
to 
the 
and 
Paul 
s 
message 
to 
the 
church 
and 
that 
the 
New 
Covenant 
is 
now 
You 
have 
to 
be 
invested 
into 
a 
serious 
error 
not 
to 
see 
it 
Paul 
told 
the 
Corinthians 
to 
partake 
in 
the 
signs 
of 
the 
new 
Covenant 
telling 
the 
church 
to 
perform 
this 
sign 
until 
he 
comes 
Who 
is 
denying 
that 
We 
have 
access 
to 
news 
media 
The 
Last 
Supper 
is 
proof 
of 
the 
New 
Covenant 
being 
instituted 
I 
have 
no 
idea 
what 
his 
point 
is 
That 
s 
not 
what 
I 
m 
saying 
I 
have 
never 
said 
anything 
that 
could 
lead 
you 
to 
insinuate 
that 
Our 
mission 
has 
not 
changed 
bring 
the 
gospel 
to 
the 
whole 
world 
God 
sure 
is 
sending 
a 
lot 
of 
His 
favorite 
people 
in 
the 
world 
to 
hell 
for 
hating 
His 
son 
Kind 
of 
odd 
don 
t 
you 
think 
There 
s 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
a 
suspended 
covenant 
That 
s 
is 
analogous 
to 
a 
divorce 
A 
divorced 
couple 
are 
not 
in 
a 
covenant 
union 
Romans 
speaks 
of 
a 
prophetic 
restoration 
I 
know 
your 
position 
is 
that 
Jesus 
is 
going 
to 
sit 
on 
a 
thrown 
in 
Jerusalem 
and 
sort 
out 
all 
the 
injustice 
in 
the 
world 
by 
hearing 
complaints 
which 
he 
being 
in 
the 
flesh 
can 
t 
possibly 
do 
so 
he 
ll 
have 
to 
set 
up 
some 
giant 
bureaucracy 
to 
run 
things 
for 
him 
Not 
buying 
it 
It 
s 
a 
prophecy 
about 
covenant 
restoration 
into 
the 
covenant 
community 
Scripture 
has 
nothing 
specific 
to 
say 
about 
just 
as 
scripture 
has 
nothing 
to 
specific 
say 
about 
the 
Crimean 
War 
It 
s 
just 
God 
s 
decree 
moving 
forward 
in 
time 
Our 
mission 
has 
not 
changed 
one 
bit 
Yes 
and 
then 
they 
will 
enter 
the 
New 
Covenant 
community 
which 
is 
the 
only 
thing 
that 
matters 
What 
are 
you 
talking 
about 
It 
s 
a 
country 
of 
unbelievers 
who 
are 
more 
or 
less 
incredibly 
hostile 
to 
Christianity 
who 
are 
surrounded 
by 
other 
countries 
incredibly 
hostile 
to 
Christianity 
What 
is 
your 
obsession 
How 
I 
t 
say 
you 
were 
in 
Israel 
Israel 
is 
over 
It 
is 
dead 
There 
s 
God 
and 
His 
people 
It 
s 
that 
simple 
People 
are 
grafted 
into 
communion 
with 
God 
not 
people 
Please 
try 
to 
understand 
this 
point 
There 
is 
no 
Israel 
Believing 
Israel 
means 
nothing 
Are 
you 
alive 
or 
are 
you 
dead 
That 
s 
the 
question 
Christ 
brought 
the 
New 
Covenant 
If 
you 
don 
t 
get 
on 
board 
you 
re 
dead 
Apostates 
were 
snapped 
off 
The 
point 
is 
not 
Israel 
centric 
To 
the 
people 
of 
God 
The 
covenant 
people 
The 
sons 
of 
Israel 
were 
grafted 
into 
that 
body 
of 
believers 
Gentiles 
were 
grafted 
in 
as 
well 
I 
agree 
God 
has 
a 
decree 
Nobody 
says 
anything 
about 
arm 
twisting 
A 
heart 
undergoing 
regeneration 
naturally 
gravitates 
towards 
God 
I 
t 
put 
it 
that 
way 
Evidence 
only 
becomes 
convincing 
if 
you 
have 
a 
softened 
heart 
God 
does 
the 
softening 
I 
heard 
all 
the 
evidence 
before 
It 
is 
super 
easy 
to 
dismiss 
if 
you 
want 
to 
dismiss 
it 
There 
s 
a 
reason 
it 
s 
called 
faith 
Could 
you 
give 
a 
specific 
example 
I 
can 
relate 
to 
his 
experience 
Well 
that 
s 
good 
for 
the 
congregation 
I 
heard 
that 
tension 
is 
a 
common 
though 
Those 
were 
anecdotes 
but 
I 
heard 
enough 
of 
them 
to 
make 
a 
mental 
note 
Very 
true 
It 
is 
both 
a 
string 
and 
percussion 
I 
think 
more 
people 
on 
the 
street 
would 
think 
of 
it 
in 
terms 
of 
beat 
vs 
melody 
though 
By 
God 
s 
providence 
I 
got 
this 
very 
strange 
notion 
in 
my 
head 
that 
I 
t 
had 
in 
a 
while 
I 
wanted 
to 
know 
more 
Atheists 
have 
this 
weird 
delusion 
that 
they 
understand 
scripture 
more 
than 
believers 
and 
I 
wanted 
to 
freshen 
up 
on 
my 
critique 
That 
s 
about 
when 
God 
flipped 
me 
Can 
you 
give 
one 
specific 
example 
I 
had 
heard 
the 
gospel 
hundreds 
of 
times 
before 
then 
I 
thought 
it 
was 
absurd 
and 
the 
people 
offering 
it 
were 
absurd 
It 
repulsed 
me 
At 
the 
time 
of 
my 
conversion 
I 
t 
been 
witnessed 
to 
in 
years 
I 
was 
a 
militant 
atheist 
who 
hated 
Christianity 
and 
Christians 
I 
would 
describe 
it 
as 
God 
s 
work 
that 
manifested 
itself 
both 
gradual 
and 
sudden 
Sort 
of 
like 
the 
straw 
that 
broke 
the 
camel 
s 
back 
but 
in 
my 
case 
it 
was 
the 
gradual 
softening 
of 
the 
heart 
I 
shared 
it 
on 
this 
tread 
already 
I 
thought 
this 
was 
a 
generally 
accepted 
fact 
t 
even 
a 
term 
until 
about 
Prior 
to 
that 
all 
were 
considered 
I 
think 
it 
has 
to 
do 
with 
the 
Zeitgeist 
of 
post 
WWI 
era 
pessimism 
The 
idea 
of 
making 
worship 
cool 
or 
treat 
it 
as 
an 
evangelistic 
tool 
is 
very 
suspicious 
to 
me 
Worship 
is 
for 
believers 
It 
t 
to 
cater 
to 
unbelievers 
I 
personally 
don 
t 
see 
it 
as 
a 
big 
deal 
or 
something 
to 
be 
legalistic 
about 
It 
s 
more 
about 
sincerely 
trying 
to 
honor 
God 
and 
worship 
in 
a 
way 
that 
would 
not 
be 
a 
New 
Covenant 
version 
of 
strange 
fire 
innovations 
The 
piano 
is 
a 
string 
instrument 
God 
likes 
string 
instruments 
in 
worship 
whether 
it 
is 
on 
earth 
or 
in 
heaven 
The 
NT 
did 
not 
abolish 
string 
instruments 
No 
That 
s 
a 
primitive 
baptist 
thing 
Also 
worth 
mentioning 
you 
re 
knowledge 
of 
church 
history 
needs 
some 
work 
You 
are 
conflating 
Roman 
Catholic 
with 
catholic 
in 
the 
same 
breath 
that 
you 
almost 
acknowledge 
the 
distinction 
We 
are 
catholic 
The 
universal 
church 
Not 
the 
individualistic 
anarchist 
reflection 
of 
a 
decadent 
American 
culture 
church 
My 
pastor 
lives 
on 
church 
grounds 
It 
is 
pretty 
humble 
You 
guys 
seem 
to 
associate 
organized 
churches 
with 
these 
charlatans 
that 
seem 
to 
have 
taken 
over 
the 
evangelical 
world 
I 
don 
t 
see 
the 
office 
of 
worship 
leader 
in 
scripture 
It 
s 
a 
superfluous 
position 
Many 
pastors 
I 
know 
outside 
of 
old 
school 
Presbyterianism 
have 
constant 
issues 
with 
the 
worship 
team 
either 
starting 
drama 
or 
getting 
off 
message 
into 
what 
people 
want 
to 
hear 
vs 
need 
to 
hear 
We 
treat 
the 
youth 
like 
they 
are 
adults 
Unless 
a 
baby 
can

stop 
crying 
or 
needs 
a 
diaper 
change 
they 
are

We

songs 
from 
the 
Trinity 
Psalter 
Hymnal 
that 
usually

No

I 
don

of 
these

denomination

I

they 
are 
awful 
We 
don 
t 
have 
a 
big 
screen 
or 
multi 
big 
screens 
We 
don 
t 
have 
a 
sound 
system 
although 
the

go 
to 
little 
speakers 
in 
a

crying 
kids 
We 
have 
a

No

We

We

no

My 
pastor 
makes 
circa 
k 
The 
pastor 
should 
be 
an 
elder 
He 
s 
not 
Moses 
He 
should 
have 
other 
elders 
who 
keep 
him 
in 
check 
A 
presbytery 
made 
up 
of 
elders 
from 
numerous 
congregations 
should 
have 
oversight 
in 
case 
one 
congregation 
goes 
off 
the 
tracks 
Nobody 
is 
forcing 
offerings 
If 
your 
knee 
jerk 
reaction 
is 
to 
get 
defensive 
when 
the 
offering 
comes 
up 
then 
you 
got 
a 
problem 
I 
m 
in 
favor 
of 
expository 
preaching 
not 
topical 
preaching 
Rome 
would 
most 
certainly 
not 
have 
approved 
of 
st 
century 
church 
structure 
That 
s 
why 
there 
was 
a 
reformation 
You 
seem 
to 
imply 
that 
because 
power 
was 
abused 
we 
should 
abandon 
the 
system 
God 
set 
up 
for 
our 
benefit 
Galatians 
One 
who 
is 
taught 
the 
word 
must 
share 
all 
good 
things 
with 
the 
one 
who 
teaches 
Let 
the 
elders 
who 
rule 
well 
be 
considered 
worthy 
of 
double 
honor 
especially 
those 
who 
labor 
in 
preaching 
and 
teaching 
For 
the 
Scripture 
says 
You 
shall 
not 
muzzle 
an 
ox 
when 
it 
treads 
out 
the 
grain 
and 
The 
laborer 
deserves 
his 
wages 
Tim 
That 
s 
your 
right 
just 
as 
it 
is 
Paul 
s 
right 
to 
deny 
wages 
However 
look 
at 
the 
Pastoral 
Epistles 
First 
off 
that 
s 
rubbish 
Secondly 
Jesus 
references 
to 
two 
or 
three 
witnesses 
is 
from 
the 
Torah 
Paul 
said 
the 
exact 
same 
thing 
They 
set 
up 
the 
church 
as 
true 
Israel 
This 
big 
sharp 
cut 
in 
the 
fabric 
of 
time 
t 
as 
clear 
cut 
as 
you 
seem 
to 
think 
Okay 
so 
you 
re 
opposed 
to 
the 
system 
of 
church 
organization 
that 
God 
set 
up 
and 
was 
spelled 
out 
via 
your 
only 
apostle 
Paul 
especially 
in 
the 
pastoral 
epistles 
and 
now 
you 
walk 
around 
like 
individualist 
Popes 
How 
American 
God

I 
m 
a 
traditional 
Presbyterian 
who 
subscribes 
to 
the 
regulative 
principle 
of

I 
don

believe 
in 
that 
stuff 
I 
think 
they 
are 
dangerous 
You 
are

antinomian

Christian 
Christ 
set 
up 
the 
church 
Told 
it 
to 
the 
apostles 
They 
set 
up 
the 
churches 
after 
Pentecost 
Paul 
says 
the 
exact 
same 
things 
in 
the 
pastoral 
letters 
You 
are 
on 
the 
outside 
The 
organized 
body 
of 
believers 
under 
a 
plurality 
of 
leadership 
with 
rules 
for 
dealing 
with 
things 
Agreed 
The 
little 
guy 
can 
appeal 
to 
the 
elders 
or 
take 
it 
to 
the 
presbytery 
to 
reign 
in 
an 
over 
zealous 
local 
leader 
but 
wait 
you 
don 
t 
believe 
in 
that 
so 
you 
got 
no 
recourse 
That 
stinks 
For 
where 
two 
or 
three

among

Look 
at 
the 
context 
It 
s 
not 
about 
guys 
calling 
themselves 
the 
church 
It 
s 
about 
organized 
church 
authority 
and 
hierarchy 
Now 
this 
is 
the 
point 
where 
you 
say 
that 
s 
a 
Jewish 
thing 
right 
Truly 
I 
say 
to 
you 
whatever 
you 
bind 
on 
earth 
shall 
be 
bound 
in 
heaven 
and 
whatever 
you 
loose 
on 
earth 
shall 
be 
loosed 
in 
heaven 
Again 
I 
say 
to 
you 
if 
two 
of 
you 
agree 
on 
earth 
about 
anything 
they 
ask 
it 
will 
be 
done 
for 
them 
by 
my 
Father 
in 
heaven 
by 
the 
evidence 
of 
two 
or 
three 
witnesses 
If 
he 
refuses 
to 
listen 
to 
them 
tell 
it 
to 
the 
church 
And 
if 
he 
refuses 
to 
listen 
even 
to 
the 
church 
let 
him 
be 
to 
you 
as 
a 
Gentile 
and 
a 
tax 
collector 
If 
your 
brother 
sins 
against 
you 
go 
and 
tell 
him 
his 
fault 
between 
you 
and 
him 
alone 
If 
he 
listens 
to 
you 
you 
have 
gained 
your 
brother 
But 
if 
he 
does 
not 
listen 
take 
one 
or 
two 
others 
along 
with 
you 
that 
every 
charge 
may

don

an 
appreciation

Church 
history 
Augustine 
was 
writing 
during 
a 
transitional 
period 
in 
which 
he 
had 
aspects 
of 
catholicity 
as 
well 
as 
incipient 
concepts 
Augustine 
needed 
reformation 
If 
you 
don 
t 
like 
fellowship 
with 
believers 
on 
earth 
then 
you 
won 
t 
like 
it 
in 
the 
afterlife

might 
hear 
I 
never 
knew 
you 
The 
aspect 
should 
be 
called 
on 
to 
be 
reformed 
just 
as 
the 
eastern 
orthodox 
should 
be 
called 
on 
to 
be 
reformed 
but 
the 
universal 
catholic 
church 
is 
nothing 
to 
be 
ashamed 
of 
We 
have 
a 
connection 
to 
the 
ancient 
universal 
catholic 
church 
along 
with 
its 
ecumenical 
doctrinal 
creeds

describing 
merit

at 
the

was 
asking

much

From 
our 
conversations 
you 
made 
it 
abundantly 
clear 
that 
you 
heard 
the 
preaching 
of 
the 
gospel 
and 
you 
made 
the 
wise 
decision 
to 
have 
faith 
and 
because 
of 
this 
wise 
decision 
you 
merit 
salvation 
and 
the 
guy 
without 
faith 
t 
merit 
salvation 
Don 
t 
play 
with 
words 
Because 
we 
hold 
to 
the 
biblical 
view 
of 
in 
which 
regeneration 
directly 
into 
saving 
faith 
we 
are 
the 
only 
ones 
who 
can 
claim 
faith 
as 
a 
non 
meritorious 
act 
of 
God 
s 
grace 
alone 
What 
you 
have 
to 
do 
is 
play 
games 
with 
the 
definition 
of 
merit 
Okay 
be 
evasive 
You 
want 
the 
king 
to 
pardon 
you 
but 
you 
do 
not 
acknowledge 
him 
as 
king 
That 
is 
just 
having 
knowledge 
It 
is 
not 
being 
known 
though 
Savior 
and 
Being 
in 
the 
body 
is 
being 
in 
the

you

know 
about

That

all 
Christ 
shed 
blood

deny 
being

I 
think 
anyone 
who 
rebels 
against 
entering 
into 
Covenant 
with 
the 
Triune 
God 
will 
not 
reap 
any 
benefits 
In 
fact 
you 
have 
enough 
knowledge 
that 
you 
heap 
up 
by 
merely 
giving 
intellectual 
assent 
They 
claim 
to 
be 
outside 
of 
the 
Covenant 
They 
think 
the 
signs 
of 
the 
Covenant 
t 
for 
them 
but 
there 
is 
no 
salvation 
outside 
the 
Covenant 
What 
they 
have 
is 
knowledge 
Knowledge 
outside 
of 
Covenant 
just 
means 
more 
I 
like 
it 
when 
they 
interpret 
God 
is 
no 
respecter 
of 
persons 
at 
face 
value 
instead 
of 
looking 
up 
what 
the 
phrase 
respecter 
of 
persons 
actually 
means 
Someone 
who 
treats 
people 
according 
to 
their

were

with 
nothing 
about 
Westminster

something 
generic

I 
m 
not 
saying 
that

fits 
that 
description

I 
wonder 
why 
they

an

This 
week 
we 
have 
the 
last 
lecture 
that 
I 
gave 
in 
New 
Zealand 
the 
story 
of 
Scripture 
Next 
week 
Todd 
and 
I 
will 
be 
back

Why 
am 
I 
not 
surprised 
it 
is 
one 
of 
those 
with 
City 
Church 
in 
the 
name 
If 
you 
think 
identifying 
yourself 
as 
Presbyterian 
will 
turn 
worldly 
people 
off 
then 
teaching 
Presbyterian 
doctrine 
will 
definitely 
turn 
people 
off 
So 
why 
not 
get 
rid 
of 
that 
too 
Here 
s 
how 
the 
Cain 
and 
Abel 
story 
is 
portrayed 
Be 
warned 
this 
is 
very 
disturbing 
and 
in 
presenting 
humans 
this 
way 
it 
makes 
God 
s 
love 
for 
mankind 
look 
literally 
insane 
Humans 
came 
into 
His 
house 
i 
e 
the 
world 
and 
treated 
the 
house 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
house 
and 
each 
other 
like 
animals 
It 
is 
a 
very 
very 
disturbing 
yet 
provocative 
film 
However 
the 
theological 
errors 
are 
not 
the 
most 
disturbing 
thing 
about 
the 
film 
Rather 
the 
most 
disturbing 
thing 
is 
what 
it 
gets 
right 
It 
portrays 
humanity 
as 
the 
most 
unworthy 
ungrateful 
destructive 
violent 
creatures 
imaginable 
I 
just 
saw 
one 
of 
the 
most 
odd 
films 
of 
my 
entire 
life 
called 
mother 
Prime 
a 
biblical 
allegory 
of 
God 
s 
creation 
It 
is 
heretical 
in 
so 
many 
ways 
so 
I 
t 
recommend 
it 
to 
someone 
without 
a 
good 
grasp 
of 
doctrine 
coupled 
with 
discernment 
t 
co 
I 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
assume 
but 
I 
just 
kind 
of 
assumed 
that 
they 
were 
built 
by 
other 
denominations 
that 
closed 
down 
and 
were 
bought 
up 
Some 
came 
with 
housing 
Others 
t 
That 
makes 
sense 
There 
s 
a 
lot 
of 
diversity 
in 
architecture 
I 
m 
not 
trying 
to 
be 
a 
hater 
but 
I 
think 
that 
for 
most 
people 
not 
having 
to 
worry 
about 
spending 
circa 
half 
their 
income 
on 
housing 
would 
change 
the 
meaning 
of 
one 
s 
paycheck 
You 
are 
right 
I 
thought 
it 
was

here 
After 
telling 
Ezekiel 
that 
virtually 
nobody 
is 
going 
to 
listen 
to 
him 
God 
commands 
him 
to 
speak 
to 
them 
and 
say 
to 
them 
Thus 
says 
the 
Lord 
God 
whether 
they 
hear 
or 
refuse 
to 
hear 
As 
such 
Ezekiel 
is 
leveling 
blessings 
and 
curses 
Jesus 
said 
shake 
the 
dust 
off 
your 
feet 
This 
is 
essential 
teaching 
Hard 
hearts 
do 
not 
hear 
God 
says 
the 
house 
of 
Israel 
will 
not 
be 
willing 
to 
listen 
to 
you 
for 
they 
are 
not 
willing 
to 
listen 
to 
me 
because 
all 
the 
house 
of 
Israel 
have 
a 
hard 
forehead 
and 
a 
stubborn 
heart 
The 
heart 
needs

dipping 
into

of

that 
an

almost

an 
illustration 
of

self 
destructive 
people

Unless 
anyone 
has 
any 
serious 
questions

all 
that 
can 
be 
said 
has 
already 
been 
said 
We 
been 
over 
this 
I 
m 
becoming 
bored 
of 
repeating 
myself 
so 
you 
can 
reply 
with 
a 
bunch 
of 
nonsense 
and 
mid 
Acts 
slogans 
that 
t 
address 
what 
I 
m 
actually 
saying 
You 
seem 
to 
conflate 
reading 
another 
man 
s 
opinion 
with 
being 
forced 
to 
accept 
it 
It 
s 
okay 
to 
read 
books 
that 
challenge 
your 
thinking 
You 
don 
t 
have 
to 
be 
afraid 
They 
t 
going 
to 
kill 
you 
The 
issue 
is 
not 
that 
you 
cite 
scripture 
verses 
It 
s 
that 
you 
manhandle 
them 
to 
the 
point 
where 
they 
can 
t 
be 
harmonized 
with 
other 
parts 
of 
scripture 
which 
is 
why 
you 
have 
to 
come 
up 
with 
the 
Jewish 
George 
technique 
which 
t 
even 
solve 
all 
your 
problems 
You 
and 
are 
cookie 
cutter 
mid 
Acts 
Paul 
might 
be 
as 
well 
I 
m 
not 
sure 
he 
s 
thought 
it 
through 
Josh 
is 
a 
traditionalist 
of 
sorts 
without 
all 
the 
mid 
Acts 
insanity 
It 
s 
not 
that 
you 
don 
t 
need 
to 
read 
them 
It 
s 
that 
you 
don 
t 
want 
to 
read 
them 
It 
s 
because 
you 
re 
from 
a 
culture 
that 
is 
hostile 
afraid 
of 
reading 
other 
people 
You 
give 
too 
much 
credit 
to 
White 
He 
t 
invent 
the 
flattening 
out 
phrase 
It 
is 
actually 
a 
common 
phrase 
found 
in 
theology 
books 
but 
you 
take 
pride 
in 
not 
reading 
theologians 
so 
you 
t 
know 
it 
It 
is 
because 
I 
consider 
your 
school 
of 
theology 
to 
be 
heretical 
Why 
t 
I 
reject 
it 
Compromised 
is 
a 
word 
that 
captures 
all 
those 
other 
words 
you 
listed 
plus 
more 
My 
obsession 
is 
taking 
the 
whole 
council 
of

cartoon 
You 
are 
squishing 
everything 
down 
into 
a 
flattened 
out 
question 
of 
to 
heaven 
so 
when 
I 
say 
God 
disciplines 
people 
in 
this 
life 
you 
think 
I 
m 
talking 
about 
something 
I 
am 
not 
talking 
about 
Not 
even 
close 
Go 
take

look 
at

twitter 
Simply 
getting 
the 
results 
of 
what 
they 
done 
in 
the 
flesh 
is 
not 
going

disciplines 
people 
He 
disciplines 
nations 
He 
gives 
compromised 
Christians 
over 
to

just 
as 
He 
gave 
compromised 
Israel 
over 
to 
their

Talking

is 
optional 
five 
minutes

his 
heel 
Christians 
get 
the 
curses 
and 
blessings 
Look 
at 
the 
once 
faithful 
churches 
who 
God 
divorced 
Look 
at 
the 
material 
blessings 
taken 
away 
from 
those 
who 
turn 
away 
Look 
at 
the 
enemies 
getting 
the 
upper 
hand 
God 
is 
still 
in 
control 
Are 
you 
referring 
to 
God 
announcing 
the 
decree 
of 
putting 
enmity 
between 
the 
people 
of 
the 
serpent 
and 
the 
people 
of 
God 
using 
the 
future 
sense 
which 
is 
followed 
immediately 
in 
the 
very 
next 
chapter 
by 
the 
birth 
of 
Cain 
and 
Abel 
and 
the 
narrative 
about 
the 
enmity 
between 
them 
Boasting 
of 
the 
power 
of 
God 
offends 
people 
at 
the 
fleshly 
level 
They 
nitpick 
it 
They 
change 
the 
subject 
They 
disrupt 
the 
flow 
of 
scripture 
all 
in 
an 
effort 
to 
get 
out 
from 
under 
that 
fact 
Then 
they 
blast 
those 
who 
proclaim 
it 
It 
s 
not 
surprising 
in 
the 
least 
I 
boast 
of 
the 
power 
of 
God 
If 
you 
consider 
persevering 
to 
be 
a 
work 
then 
you 
are 
saying 
that 
you 
also 
consider 
faith 
five 
minutes 
after 
accepting 
an 
alter 
call 
to 
be 
completely 
optional 
Which 
is 
why 
all 
I 
get 
is 
from 
your 
camp 
when 
I 
bring 
up 
apostasy 
or 
even 
someone 
who 
appeared 
to 
everyone 
as 
who 
later 
became 
a 
Satanist 
You 
simply 
shutdown 
and 
act 
like 
it 
is 
impossible 
or 
hypothetical 
Like 
I 
said 
do 
not 
like 
complexity 
There 
is 
no 
born 
again 
new 
birth 
certificate 
you 
can 
frame 
and 
put 
on 
your 
wall 
There 
is 
no 
official 
acceptance 
paperwork 
from 
God 
with 
your 
name 
on 
it 
with 
the 
genuine 
box 
checked 
rather 
than 
the 
self 
deceived 
box 
checked 
Jude 
is 
bringing 
attention 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
God 
does 
not 
send 
down 
a 
born 
again 
certificate 
Some 
people 
hear 
a 
five 
star 
preacher 
man 
and 
get 
all 
frenzied 
and 
are 
bored 
of 
Christ 
a 
week 
later 
Or 
throw 
in 
the 
towel 
under 
adversity 
do 
not 
like 
complexity 
It 
is 
understandable 
to 
people 
who 
have 
the 
whole 
council 
of 
God 
I 
understand 
it 
I 
just 
find 
it 
goofy 
and 
unacceptable 
I 
do 
not 
accept 
the 
idea 
that 
Jude 
wrote 
his 
letter 
to 
the 
Jewish 
George 
I 
reject 
your 
interpretation 
It 
s 
too 
outlandish 
and 
idiosyncratic 
and 
novel 
It 
is 
also 
completely 
unnecessary 
It 
s 
a 
historical 
narrative 
There 
is 
no 
necessity 
to 
have 
some 
weird 
interpretation 
about 
hybrid 
DNA 
when 
a 
perfectly 
non 
weird 
interpretation 
exists 
I 
m 
not 
sure 
how 
I 
can 
apply 
Genesis 
to 
my 
life 
to 
be 
honest 
I 
understand 
that 
tend 
to 
take 
a 
DNA 
approach 
Genesis 
I 
really 
really 
really 
don 
t 
want 
to 
go 
down 
that 
rabbit 
hole 
Either 
way 
you 
look 
at 
it 
it 
s 
still 
about 
covenant 
There 
is 
no 
literal 
physical 
seed 
of 
Satan 
Some 
Rabbis 
had 
weird 
theories 
about 
that 
but 
they 
are 
wrong 
It 
s 
about 
who 
is 
your 
master 
God 
or 
the 
serpent 
with 
the 
freewill 
gospel 
Speaking 
of 
Jude 
Did 
you 
notice 
how 
he 
prayed 
to 
God 
who 
has 
the 
power 
to 
keep 
the 
people 
from 
stumbling 
It 
s 
almost 
like 
stumbling 
is 
under 
the 
sovereign 
decree 
of 
God 
too 
Such 
an 
odd 
absence 
of 
modernist 
humanist 
thinking 
in 
Jude 
It 
is 
the 
same 
with 
fallen 
man 
He 
needs 
to 
be 
regenerated 
to 
see 
the 
sweetness 
in 
the 
offer 
Otherwise 
it 
is 
just 
as 
repulsive 
to 
him 
as 
it 
is 
to 
his 
fallen 
angel 
counterpart 
You 
are 
not 
addressing 
the 
actual 
point 
We 
are 
fallen 
now 
You 
say 
we 
are 
affected 
by 
it 
but 
not 
really 
I 
doubt 
you 
d 
say 
that 
a 
demon 
could 
hear 
a 
five 
star 
sermon 
and 
say 
wow 
I 
have 
been 
super 
wrong 
let 
me 
say 
a 
prayer 
and 
get 
faith 
Not 
gonna 
happen 
It 
repulses 
them 
This 
is 
about 
covenant 
not 
DNA 
Are 
we 
not 
talking 
about 
a 
fallen 
world 
Read 
Romans 
again 
It 
says 
God 
foreknows 
people 
Then 
they 
fell 
and 
now 
they 
are 
demonic 
Man 
did 
not 
sin 
at 
first 
and 
then 
man 
fell 
and 
now 
man 
is 
essentially 
demonic 
without 
the 
special 
grace 
of 
God 
I 
m 
going 
to 
assume 
that 
you 
intended 
to 
have 
the 
form 
rather 
than 
the 
content 
be 
the 
focus 
here 
i 
e 
you 
wanted 
to 
post 
a 
and 
not 
address 
what 
I 
actually 
said 
So 
be 
it 
Are 
you 
trying 
to 
accurately 
represent 
what 
I 
said 
If 
so 
you 
are 
way 
off 
base 
I 
am 
worried 
that 
this 
question 
is 
coming 
from 
a 
place 
of 
modernist 
humanism 
Are 
those 
called 
and 
adopted 
as 
sons 
of 
God 
fully 
human 
Many 
Christians 
talk 
about 
how 
important 
the 
body 
is 
but 
would 
never 
reflect 
deeply 
on 
the 
significance 
of 
blood 
You 
can 
see 
this 
in 
a 
concrete 
way 
in 
cultural 
studies 
as 
well 
Look 
around 
the 
world 
and 
you 
see 
serpent 
worship 
on 
every 
continent 
with 
human 
societies 
I 
know 
this 
is 
hard 
for 
people 
from 
a 
fundamentalist 
background 
but 
stop 
thinking 
so 
literally 
and 
modern 
and 
start 
thinking 
like 
an 
ancient 
person 
If 
you 
think 
a 
verse 
is 
about 
DNA 
then 
you 
are 
almost 
certainly 
wrong 
This 
is 
why 
you 
guys 
get 
so 
mixed 
up 
with 
Israel 
The 
whole 
language 
about 
Rome 
and 
the 
empire 
Babylon 
and 
the 
Beast 
fit 
the 
last 
days 
of 
Nero 
and 
the 
time 
immediately 
f 
Freedom 
from 
God 
s 
law 
is 
slavery 
to 
men 
s 
If 
people 
just 
followed 
the 
second 
commandment 
then 
we 
can 
stop 
the 
silliness 
P 
S 
and 
if 
you 
are 
in 
Christ 
the 
children 
of 
the 
serpent 
will 
hate 
you 
for 
it 
Just 
as 
scripture 
describes 
the 
fallen 
angels 
as 
totally 
depraved 
they 
are 
also 
described 
as 
being 
on 
a 
leash 
which 
keeps 
them 
from 
acting 
as 
depraved 
as 
they 
inherently 
are 
Fallen 
man 
is 
the 
same 
God 
keeps 
fallen 
man 
on 
a 
leash 
to 
prevent 
us 
from 
destroying 
everything 
You 
say 
you 
acknowledge 
the 
fall 
with 
your 
mouth 
because 
it 
s 
impossible 
to 
miss 
it 
but 
you 
want 
to 
soften 
it 
to 
the 
point 
where 
our 
minds 
t 
as 
naturally 
messed 
up 
and 
mentally 
enslaved 
as 
the 
demons 
What 
separates 
us 
from 
them 
is 
God 
s 
transforming 
grace 
You 
seem 
to 
understand 
the 
nature 
of 
fallen 
angels 
They 
are 
totally 
depraved 
totally 
wicked 
They 
reject 
God 
They 
are 
never 
going 
to 
stop 
rejecting 
God 
It 
s 
in 
their 
nature 
Then 
when 
you 
start 
talking 
about 
fallen 
man 
you 
put 
on 
your 
rose 
colored 
glasses 
This 
idea 
that 
you 
guys 
have 
that 
we 
are 
not 
affected 
by 
the 
fall 
in 
any 
serious 
way 
leads 
to 
your 
belief 
that 
we 
are 
neutral 
that 
natural 
man 
does 
not 
respond 
like 
a 
demon 
to 
the 
gospel 
prior 
to 
regeneration 
We 
need 
to 
back 
it 
up 
a 
moment 
and 
get 
into 
the 
anthropology 
We 
are 
fallen 
creatures 
not 
that 
different 
from 
fallen 
angels 
We 
are 
born 
embodied 
demons 
instead 
of 
disembodied 
demons 
We 
like 
demonic 
stuff 
Then 
God 
redeems 
us 
with 
His 
grace 
and 
we 
become 
more 
angelic 
And 
yet 
he 
was 
incurably 
wicked 
in 
the 
face 
of 
the 
awesome 
God 
of 
the 
universe 
and 
all 
his 
descendants 
were 
even 
more 
wicked 
and 
God 
destroyed 
everyone 
but 
one 
family 
who 
was 
not 
related 
to 
him 
Wow 
it 
sounds 
like 
Jesus 
saw 
the 
murder 
of 
Abel 
as 
something 
more 
significant 
than 
a 
local 
crime 
news 
report 
Please 
learn 
that 
real 
events 
can 
have 
symbolic 
meaning 
The 
murder 
of 
Abel 
is 
not 
simply 
a 
local 
news 
report 
The 
children 
of 
God 
and 
the 
children 
of 
the 
serpent 
will 
be 
in 
conflict 
Christ 
is 
the 
awaited 
savior 
It 
was 
a 
Messianic 
prophecy 
The 
entire 
OT 
is 
filled 
with 
foreshadow 
and 
typology 
of 
that 
prophecy 
Cain 
was 
never 
going 
to 
master 
sin 
He 
had 
no 
inclination 
to 
master 
sin 
Do 
you 
realize 
we 
are 
talking 
about 
a 
reprobate 
Do 
you 
understand 
that 
something 
can 
be 
a 
foreshadow 
and 
be 
a 
real 
event 
at 
the 
same 
time 
It 
is 
a 
foreshadow 
How 
can 
you 
not 
see 
that 
If 
freewill 
is 
everywhere 
then 
congrats 
You 
found 
your 
true 
god 
Cain 
had 
options 
His 
hands 
crafted 
what 
his 
heart 
desired 
which 
was 
dedicated 
to 
his 
father 
the 
serpent 
Did 
Cain 
actually 
master 
it 
No 
And 
the 
reason 
why 
is 
he 
was 
a 
son 
of 
the 
serpent 
Mastering 
sin 
was 
not 
in 
his 
nature 
Thus 
there 
was 
inherent 
antithesis 
between 
him 
and 
Abel 
which 
is 
why 
he 
murdered 
him 
John 
writes 
We 
should 
not 
be 
like 
Cain 
who 
was 
of 
the 
evil 
one 
Can 
you 
think 
of 
anyone 
else 
called 
the 
evil 
one 
I 
m 
sure 
you 
can 
Well 
Cain 
was 
his 
son 
not 
literally 
although 
some 
Rabbis 
entertained 
that 
idea 
What 
bible 
am 
I 
reading 
The 
same 
bible 
that 
presents 
Cain 
as 
the 
quintessential 
son 
of 
the 
serpent 
I 
will 
put 
enmity 
between 
you 
and 
the 
woman 
and 
between 
your 
offspring 
and 
her 
offspring 
The 
offspring 
is 
not 
biological 
It 
s 
like 
when 
Christ 
called 
his 
mockers 
the 
sons 
of 
Satan 
Cain 
was 
the 
son 
of 
Satan 
Therefore 
for 
him 
to 
honor 
God 
would 
be 
against 
his 
nature 
Do 
you 
see 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
modern 
western 
humanist 
idea 
you 
re 
talking 
about 
and 
a 
non 
mandatory

Apocrypha 
You 
are 
though 
You 
chose 
God 
He 
loved 
sin 
You 
are 
smarter 
then 
a 
genius 
What 
people 
choose 
is 
a 
reflection 
of 
their 
nature 
They 
are 
not 
neutral 
in 
any 
regard 
So 
you 
love 
your 
sins 
less 
then 
say 
Stephen 
Hawking 
You 
chose 
God 
because 
you 
are 
better 
then 
him 
And 
if 
that 
is 
what 
you 
are 
saying 
then 
explain 
the 
difference 
between 
those 
who 
react 
positively 
vs 
negatively 
It 
sounds 
like 
you 
are 
saying 
that 
man 
s 
consciousness 
is 
not 
affected 
by 
sin 
and 
all 
he 
needs 
to 
hear 
is 
a 
five 
star

to 
rationally

what

I

a

without

or

Here 
s 
one 
of 
my 
critiques 
of 
I 
never 
hear 
you 
guys 
ever 
talk 
about 
the 
role 
of 
the 
the 
second 
temple 
in 
prophecy 
either 
it 
s 
construction 
or 
destruction 
Everything 
about 
the 
second 
temple 
is 
pushed 
into 
some 
futuristic 
era 
as 
temple 
Thank 
you 
for 
the 
challenge 
but 
like 
I 
said 
before 
I 
don 
t

repeat 
Some 
people 
are 
Calvinistic 
in 
their 
view 
of 
Believe 
it 
or 
not 
unlike 
today 
s 
contemporary

exile 
making

II 
So 
you 
can 
t 
even 
entertain 
the 
possibility 
that 
Ezekiel 
s 
vision 
was 
not 
a 
photograph 
That 
prophecy 
either 
already 
happened 
in 
a 
manner 
in 
which 
you 
haven 
t 
considered 
or 
it 
never 
will 
happen 
When 
the 
zealots 
rose 
up 
they

office

proof

affiliation 
There 
are 
no 
more 
tribes 
Nobody 
can 
prove 
they 
are 
this 
or 
that 
and 
there 
s 
no 
way 
to 
reconstruct 
them 
either 
I 
m 
under 
the 
impression 
that 
that 
theology 
has 
essentially 
been 
an 
answer 
to 
Pharisaical 
objections 
to 
Jesus 
as 
the 
messiah 
They 
essentially 
take 
their 
misconceptions 
and 
incorrect 
expectations 
and 
shove 
them 
into 
the 
future 
rather

The 
Americans 
took 
out 
a 
part 
about 
the 
civil 
magistrate 
s 
role 
in 
ecclesiastical 
matters 
in 
after 
splitting 
from 
England 
I 
believe 
it 
was 
something 
along 
the 
lines 
of 
the 
head

state 
could 
call

While 
and 
I 
enjoy 
our 
vacations 
you 
can 
hear 
what 
I 
had 
to 
say 
about 
biblical 
theology 
and 
to 
our 
bro 
How 
does 
one 
reject 
Ezekiel 
That 
s 
like 
rejecting 
the 
moon 
landing 
It 
already 
happened 
and 
we 
have 
proof 
of 
it 
It 
s 
in 
the 
past 
This 
is 
yet 
another 
illustration 
of 
why 
you 
are 
accused 
of 
being 
a 
secular 
humanist 
ally 
So 
blasphemy 
is 
just 
an 
issue 
of 
hurt 
feelings 
Well 
somebody 
has 
got 
to 
rule 
If 
you 
want 
to 
surrender 
that 
responsibility 
to 
God 
s 
enemies 
then 
don 
t 
pretend 
it 
s 
a 
prophetic 
sign 
of 
the 
end 
times 
when 
it 
s 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
Christian 
escapism

E 
Scripture 
defines 
the 
difference 
between 
a 
dead 
martyr 
and 
dead 
blasphemer 
say 
that 
Satan 
is 
the 
king 
of 
kings 
and 
the 
rulers 
are 
subservient 
to 
him 
Paul 
says 
that 
rulers 
are 
subservient 
to 
Christ 
the 
King 
of 
kings 
even 
if 
they 
do 
not 
acknowledge 
it 
A 
civic 
government 
not 
governed 
by 
Christians 
t 
care 
about 
blasphemy 
laws 
which 
is 
why 
our 
society 
is 
becoming 
increasingly 
more 
and 
more 
blasphemous 
Geneva 
however 
was 
governed 
by 
Christians 
Then 
what 
Paul 
says 
about 
civic 
leaders 
makes 
no 
sense 
It 
is 
yet 
another 
example 
of 
how 
confuses 
people 
While 
the 
church 
state 
distinction 
t 
be 
interpreted 
as 
the 
secularists 
insist 
there 
is 
a 
biblical 
distinction 
in 
administrative 
purposes 
The 
Inquisition 
as 
an 
arm 
of 
the 
church 
had 
no 
right 
to 
administer 
that 
sort 
of 
justice 
Their 
power 
extended 
to 
excommunication 
I 
been 
asked 
more 
questions 
then 
I 
can 
keep 
track 
of 
by 
this 
point

have 
to 
be 
more 
specific 
You 
d

What 
logical 
fallacies 
But 
Paul 
does 
not 
say 
anything 
about 
mercy 
and 
grace 
He 
speaks 
of 
being 
a 
terror 
to 
the 
wrongdoers 
which 
Paul 
most 
certainly 
meant 
in 
a 
biblical 
sense 
Now 
that 
does 
not 
exclude 
mercy 
nor 
does 
it 
make 
mercy 
the 
main 
objective 
It 
takes 
wisdom 
to 
know 
the 
difference 
I 
agree 
that 
Paul 
did 
not 
distinguish 
between 
saved 
or 
lost 
rulers 
because 
Christ 
is 
King 
of 
kings 
and 
Lord 
of 
lords 
His 
Kingdom 
extends 
beyond 
heaven 
and 
the 
hearts 
of 
believers 
God 
s 
law 
That 
s 
what 
I 
m 
saying 
If 
you 
have 
some 
illegitimate 
court 
that 
violates 
biblical 
codes 
of 
legal 
conduct 
then 
that 
is 
just 
a 
refined 
form 
of 
murder 
I 
believe 
it 
was 
Paul 
who 
wrote 
that 
their 
job 
was 
to 
be 
a 
terror 
to 
the 
lawless 
If 
that 
s 
a 
sin 
then 
the 
person 
who 
picked 
that 
mode 
of 
execution 
is 
responsible 
Civic 
leaders 
are 
not 
in 
the 
primary 
business 
of 
dispensing 
mercy 
and 
grace 
They 
dispense 
law 
and 
justice 
You 
re 
frustrated 
because 
logic 
insists 
that 
there 
is 
a 
real 
distinction 
between 
a 
civic 
court 
dispensing 
based 
on 
the 
rule 
of 
law 
and 
some 
guy 
shooting 
a 
store 
clerk 
So 
when 
a 
murderer 
gets 
lawfully 
convicted 
of 
being 
a 
murderer 
and 
is 
executed 
is 
the 
guy 
who 
administers 
the 
lethal 
injection 
a 
hit 
man 
there 
s 
a 
fact 
behind 
your 
ear 
Here 
s 
the 
thing 
we 
know 
the 
Jewish 
mob 
did 
not 
have 
the 
right 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
death 
penalty 
It 
had 
to 
go 
to 
Romans 
Where 
was 
the 
Roman 
judge 
Was 
it 
a 
legal 
proceeding 
Did 
the 
executioners 
have 
a 
fair 
trial 
Did 
they 
present 
witnesses 
Did 
they 
even 
have 
the 
right 
to 
carry 
out 
the 
execution 
according 
to 
the 
law 
You 
see 
the 
difference

blasphemy

Would 
a 
witness 
for 
the 
prosecution 
in 
a 
capital 
crime 
case 
be 
guilty 
of 
murder 
Now 
this 
is 
your 
evidence 
of 
him 
being 
a 
murderer 
You 
don 
t 
need 
to 
be 
to 
be 
an 
open 
theist 
If 
they 
saw 
that 
as 
some 
legalistic 
commandment 
then 
Jesus 
corrected 
them 
I 
know 
there 
s 
a 
lot 
of 
disinformation 
out 
there 
from 
dishonest 
people 
who 
are 
terrified 
of 
their 
embracing 
these 
ideas 
so 
they 
spread 
lies 
We 
been 
over 
this 
before 
Geneva 
was 
not 
a 
theocratic 
regime 
ruled 
by 
the 
clergy

did 
not 
murder 
anyone

Bingo 
Who 
asked 
the 
question 
If 
the 
question 
is 
whether 
scripture 
teaches 
open 
theism 
or 
predestination 
the 
answer 
is 
predestination 
I 
m 
not 
too 
familiar 
with 
the 
Lutheran 
position 
s 
It 
is 
my 
understanding 
that 
although 
Luther 
made 
predestination 
a 
point 
of 
contention 
with 
the 
Papists 
his 
later 
followers 
widely 
downplayed 
this 
aspect 
of 
Luther 
s 
theology 
They 
sold 
everything 
in 
the 
city 
which 
Jesus 
said 
would 
be 
destroyed 
in 
that 
generation 
and 
moved 
outside 
the 
city 
and 
pooled 
their 
money 
among 
themselves 
They 
did 
not 
give 
it 
to 
random 
poor 
people 
Now 
don 
t 
get 
me 
wrong 
I 
like 
think 
it 
a 
good 
thing 
that 
people 
are 
embracing 
the 
five 
points 
but 
the 
five 
points 
emerge 
out 
of 
a 
deeper 
theology 
The 
five 
points 
are 
not 
the 
theology 
itself 
There 
are 
Calvinistic 
Methodists 
Calvinistic 
charismatics 
Calvinistic 
Calvinistic 
Southern 
Baptists 
Calvinistic 
etc 
etc 
Embracing 
the 
five 
points 
is 
not 
enough 
to 
be 
in 
the 
Reformed 
camp 
First 
off 
let 
me 
clear 
something 
up 
The 
five 
points 
are 
not 
Calvinism 
They 
are 
the 
five 
points 
of 
anti 
Secondly 
being 
Calvinistic 
is 
not 
being 
Reformed 
The 
five 
points 
only 
make 
up 
a 
sliver 
of 
Reformed 
theology 
A 
large 
crowd 
on 
a 
mount 
It 
s 
basic 
reading 
comprehension 
not 
If 
giving 
up 
all 
possessions 
was 
a 
universal 
commandment 
applied 
to 
everyone 
and 
not 
simply 
his 
entourage 
of 
disciples 
during 
his 
earthly 
ministry 
then 
Jesus 
would 
have 
said 
it 
to 
every 
person 
he 
met 
MacArthur 
is 
a 
He 
s 
not 
reformed 
For 
the 
same 
reason 
I 
don 
t 
try 
to 
walk 
on 
water 
because 
Jesus 
told 
Peter 
to 
walk 
on 
water 
Do 
you 
get 
all 
your 
info 
from 
random 
people 
who 
make 
low 
quality 
videos 
Revelation 
was 
to 
steel 
the 
first 
century 
Church 
against 
the 
gathering 
storm 
of 
persecution 
and 
to 
brace 
t 
So 
because 
you 
do 
not 
like 
him 
it 
is 
okay 
to 
spread 
lies 
He 
told 
not 
to 
come 
to 
Geneva 
or 
face 
prosecution 
thought 
he 
was 
untouchable 
thought 
wrong 
If 
I 
was 
alive 
during 
Jesus 
earthly 
ministry 
and 
in 
order 
to 
follow 
him 
around 
and 
be 
his 
disciple 
then 
I 
would 
certainly 
give 
up 
all 
my 
stuff 
to 
the 
poor 
What 
if 
God 
desiring 
to 
show 
his 
wrath 
and 
to 
make 
known 
his 
power 
has 
endured 
with 
much 
patience 
vessels 
of 
wrath 
prepared 
for 
destruction 
The 
Lord 
has 
made 
everything 
for 
its 
purpose 
even 
the 
wicked 
for 
the 
day 
of 
trouble 
Is 
Twitter 
your 
church 
It 
s 
not 
about 
turning 
away 
It 
s 
about 
not 
honoring 
God 
as 
God 
or 
giving 
thanks 
to 
Him 
This 
is 
a 
major 
problem 
in 
circles 
It 
t 
appeal 
to 
some 
people 
s 
hearts 
because 
in 
their 
hearts 
they 
are 
in 
love 
with 
their 
own 
will 
and 
they 
want 
their 
will 
to 
be 
done 
on 
earth 
and 
in 
heaven 
is 
an 
embodiment 
of 
this 
type 
of 
heart 
Christ 
And 
when 
you 
pray 
you 
must 
not 
be 
like 
the 
hypocrites 
For 
they 
love 
to 
stand 
and 
pray 
in 
the 
synagogues 
and 
at 
the 
street 
corners 
that 
they 
may 
be 
seen 
by 
others 
Truly 
I 
say 
to 
you 
they 
have 
received 
their 
reward 
Your 
goal 
was 
destroy 
total 
depravity 
by 
parroting 
back 
a 
key 
tenet 
of 
Reformed 
theology 
the 
OT 
Saints 
were 
save 
by 
grace 
through 
faith 
Scripture 
is 
inerrant 
Calvin 
is 
not 
I 
t 
have 
to 
say 
that 
self 
evident 
statement 
but 
apparently 
people 
have 
an 
ax 
to 
grind 
so 
they 
want 
to 
slander 
So 
you 
just 
went 
out 
into 
the 
public 
sphere 
and 
made 
your 
prayer 
for 
everyone 
to 
look 
at 
you 
and 
a 
few 
moments 
later 
you 
write 
this 
slander 
You 
just 
can 
t 
help 
yourself 
He 
ends 
the 
section 
by 
saying 
Woe 
to 
you 
O 
Jerusalem 
How 
long 
will 
it 
be 
before 
you 
are 
made 
clean 
First 
off 
WOE

a 
bad 
thing 
to 
hear 
from

It 
means 
you

it 
Secondly 
it

yourself

not

to

He 
s 
saying

that 
s 
why 
God 
is 
about 
to 
bring

on

Destroy

on

That 
s 
what 
I 
had 
in

I 
have 
no 
clue 
what 
it 
is 
Nobody 
does 
God 
s 
intention 
was 
only 
that 
we 
know 
His 
Decree

In 
the 
Reformed 
tradition 
we 
speak 
of

as 
something 
that

be 
acknowledged

treated 
very

Jeremiah

mocking 
them 
What 
What 
A 
leopard 
can 
change 
his 
spots 
Is 
that 
what 
you 
think 
Jeremiah 
is 
saying 
The 
problem 
is 
God 
said 
that 
the 
secret 
decrees 
belong 
to 
Him 
and 
we 
should 
concern 
ourselves 
only 
with 
following 
His 
commandments 
not 
trying 
to 
contrast 
the 
commands 
with 
the 
secret 
decrees 
It 
is 
a 
recipe 
for 
disaster 
Can 
the 
Ethiopian 
change 
his 
skin

the 
leopard 
his 
spots

also 
you

to 
do 
evil 
This 
is 
how 
God 
talks 
about 
Himself 
Everyone 
let 
this 
sink 
in 
God 
talks 
of 
Himself

Do 
not 
mock 
His 
Sovereignty

His

To

His

God 
to 
make

story

You 
already

you 
dismiss 
the 
notion 
that 
your 
conversion 
was 
a 
part 
of 
God

Your

was

A 
fluke 
But 
what 
about

Was

Does 
God

in

You 
are 
jealous 
of 
your

when 
there 
s 
only

you

circa 
years

Stop 
talking

God 
about 
how 
He 
dispenses 
mercy 
Limited 
sovereignty 
is 
a 
very 
accurate 
description 
of 
their 
doctrine 
The 
TRUTH 
is 
God 
shows 
mercy 
on 
who 
He 
wills 
He 
hardens 
who 
He 
wills 
I 
am 
here 
to 
warn 
you 
that 
all 
this 
talking 
back 
to 
God 
is 
dangerous 
You 
are 
not 
immune 
to 
being 
hardened 
yourself 
Do 
you 
know 
what 
faith 
means 
There 
s 
that 
liberal 
humanist 
great 
defense 
of 
the 
reprobate 
against 
the 
authority

Scratch 
the 
surface 
just 
a 
little 
and 
it

always 
there 
You 
got 
baggage 
to 
drop 
Are 
you 
asking 
where 
I 
got 
the 
idea 
that 
there 
are 
negative 
sanctions 
for 
rejecting 
the 
Gospel 
as 
foolishness 
or 
repulsive 
etc 
etc 
It 
s

The

a 
Calvinistic 
which 
is 
an 
entirely 
convoluted 
and 
confused 
theology 
Yeah 
that 
s 
the 
worldwide 
Great 
Commission 
That 
s 
not 
what 
the 
text 
says 
That 
s 
you 
position 
which 
seems 
more 
accurately 
to 
be 
that 
Jesus 
died 
because 
that 
s 
how 
things 
happened 
to 
work 
out 
and 
the 
good 
news 
is 
people 
are 
able 
to 
preach 
the 
gospel 
of 
free 
will 
about 
Jesus 
being 
able 
to 
save 
people 
who 
enjoy 
preaching 
Yes 
but 
do 
you 
see 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
spirit 
pouring 
out 
to 
the 
further 
reaches 
of 
the 
world 
and 
every 
single 
individual 
getting 
saved 
Because 
liberal 
theology 
is 
merely 
a 
reflection 
of 
modern 
psychology 
it 
is 
not 
really 
Christianity 
at 
all 
John 
is 
speaking 
about 
the 
outpouring 
of 
the 
spirit 
on 
to 
the 
whole 
map 
spreading 
worship 
of 
Yahweh 
to 
the 
furthest 
reaches 
Propitiation 
is 
the 
act 
of 
appeasing 
God 
Christ 
That 
t 
apply 
to 
the 
whole 
world 
if 
you 
define 
it 
as 
every 
individual 
because 
people 
who 
are 
propitiated 
for 
don 
t 
go 
to 
hell 
Yet 
people 
do 
go 
to 
hell 
Therefore 
whole 
world 
t 
mean 
every 
single 
person 
I 
have 
faith 
I 
have 
had 
prayers 
answered 
I 
ascribe 
that 
to 
God 
in 
praise 
and 
glory 
Yes 
please 
I 
said 
the 
world 
is 
bigger 
than 
a 
little 
plot 
of

the 
size 
of

It 
is 
not 
every

person 
and

and 
animal 
and 
germ 
and

etc 
That 
s 
not 
what 
I 
said 
For 
someone 
who 
obsessively 
makes 
distinctions 
between 
Jews 
and 
gentiles 
you 
re 
missing 
a 
big 
one 
here 
If 
you 
re 
right 
then 
propitiation 
t

propitiation 
and 
if

propitiation 
then 
your

your

Classic 
orthodox 
You 
act 
like 
that 
s 
not 
part 
of 
the 
decree 
You 
act 
like 
the 
lack 
of 
real 
autonomous 
free 
will 
negates 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
nature 
Let 
go 
of 
the 
baggage 
and 
see 
God 
everywhere 
All 
Glory 
all 
the 
time 
He 
has 
a 
plan 
I 
m 
grateful 
to 
be 
able 
to 
have 
the 
ear 
of 
the 
King 
of 
the 
universe 
I 
can 
pray 
whenever 
Having 
some 
discipline 
in 
this 
area 
is 
a 
great 
blessing 
but 
there 
s 
no 
need 
to 
be 
or 
about 
it 
You 
can 
t 
imagine 
because 
you 
don 
t 
understand 
and 
you 
respond 
with 
hostility 
to 
those 
who 
are 
trying 
to 
help 
you 
understand 
I 
ll 
take 
any 
real 
questions 
if 
you 
got 
them 
Exactly 
Why 
pray 
if 
God 
t 
in 
control 
Why 
pray 
for 
the 
conversion 
of 
others 
if 
God 
can 
t 
overcome 
their 
autonomous 
free 
will 
A 
person 
s 
prayer 
is 
part 
of 
the 
decree 
so 
that 
when 
God 
fulfills 
a 
prayer 
He 
receives 
the 
Glory 
and 
His 
name 
is 
praised 
and 
His 
power 
demonstrated 
as 
a 
witness 
and 
comfort 
We 
are 
told 
to 
pray 
We 
are 
given 
the 
desire 
to 
pray 
We 
are 
told 
to 
make 
requests 
from 
a 
position 
of 
humility 
Intense 
communion 
It 
s 
a 
common 
feature 
in 
prayer 
life 
You 
should 
start 
walking 
that 
talk 
and 
ditch 
the 
worldly 
baggage 
you 
re 
dragging 
along 
with 
you 
That 
s 
the 
mindset 
of 
the 
poor 
reprobate 
that 
you 
keep 
shedding 
tears 
over 
Pick 
a 
side 
God 
has 
a 
purpose 
for 
everything 
We 
do 
not 
need 
to 
understand 
what 
the 
purpose 
is 
but 
we 
do 
not 
ever 
question 
how 
He 
decides 
to 
run 
the 
universe 
to 
work 
out 
His 
will 
Such 
questioning 
is 
a 
lack 
of 
real 
faith 
You 
seem 
to 
have 
an 
issue 
in 
that 
arena 
If 
find 
the 
challenge 
helpful 
for 
myself 
and 
for 
people 
who 
are

the 
fence 
about 
to

This 
is 
why 
I 
find 
your 
whole

completely 
liberal 
and 
humanist 
They 
thought 
they 
could 
just 
go 
raping 
their 
way 
through 
Asia 
and 
God 
would 
sit 
back 
and 
do 
nothing 
Our 
society 
is 
being 
judged 
for 
hating 
God 
Meanwhile 
many 
Christians 
think 
playing 
for 
the 
reprobates 
is 
like 
the 
most 
loving 
thing 
ever 
Others 
reject 
their 
responsibilities 
to

escapism

mania

Scripture

it 
Did 
you

what 
I 
said 
about 
being 
united 
Please 
give 
that 
some 
more 
consideration 
When 
it 
clicks 
it

make 
beautiful 
sense 
Apologies 
I 
meant 
to 
imply 
you 
in 
a 
generic 
sense 
not 
you 
specifically 
I 
t 
trying 
to 
preach 
at 
you 
I 
have 
a 
problem 
with 
it 
It 
s 
a 
divine 
on 
our 
society 
as 
a 
whole 
We 
are 
being 
called 
to 
step 
up 
and 
drop 
this 
escapism 
that 
typifies 
If 
it 
happened 
t 
was 
part 
of 
God 
s 
plan 
This 
is 
why 
being 
resentful 
and 
unforgiving 
and 
jealous 
and 
envious 
are 
such 
a 
destructive 
sins 
It 
s 
basically 
saying 
I 
don 
t 
like 
you 
God 
for 
how 
you 
are 
running 
the 
universe 
I 
could 
do 
better 
You 
think 
your 
worthless 
rags 
that 
you 
take 
credit 
for 
are 
going 
to 
impress 
God 
Put 
another 
way 
if 
you 
receive 
the 
seal 
of 
the 
spirit 
and 
numerous 
spiritual 
blessings 
start 
to 
flow 
from 
that 
and 
as 
you 
become 
a 
better 
person 
don 
t 
start 
taking 
credit 
for 
it 
Give 
the 
glory 
to 
God 
for 
transforming 
you 
form 
the 
wretch 
you 
once 
were 
Yes 
It 
s 
part 
of 
sanctification 
The 
spirit 
molds 
you 
throughout 
your 
life 
to 
be 
in 
conformance 
with 
the 
image 
of 
Christ 
You 
will 
never 
get 
there 
totally 
in 
this 
life 
but 
it 
is 
a 
taste 
of 
things 
to 
come 
the 
complete 
transformation 
of 
your 
nature 
as 
an 
adopted 
son 
of 
God 
Yes 
you 
do 
it 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
you 
are 
not 
alone 
The 
HS 
is 
not 
some 
external 
force 
You 
are 
united 
I 
am 
not 
saying 
the 
aborted 
babies 
are 
atoning 
for 
the 
sins 
of 
the 
elect 
The 
atomic 
bomb 
was 
not 
up 
for 
public 
discussion 
It 
was 
top 
secret 
Your 
whole 
scenario 
is 
make 
believe 
I 
am 
not 
a 
mid 
acts 
who 
gets 
triggered 
like 
a 
demon 
anytime 
someone 
quotes 
Jesus 
By 
the 
Grace 
of 
God 
I 
do 
forgive 
people 
and 
He 
makes 
it 
easy 
Without 
eating 
I 
will

That 
s 
what 
happens 
Thank 
God 
for 
your 
meals 
So 
you 
take 
credit 
for 
something 
the 
divine 
power 
does 
You 
don 
t 
see 
a 
problem 
with 
that 
The

You 
t 
able 
to 
resist 
the 
devil 
on 
your 
own 
That 
s 
why 
we 
ask 
God 
in 
prayer 
to 
lead 
us 
not 
into 
temptation 
but 
deliver 
us 
from 
the 
evil 
one 
Who 
has 
ever 
said 
this 
You 
re 
playing 
make 
believe 
That 
s 
completely 
unsubstantiated 
This 
fits 
under 
the 
umbrella 
of 
He 
hardens 
who 
He 
wills 
Jesus 
loses 
none 
of 
the 
elect 
That 
is 
true 
but 
you 
don 
t 
really 
believe 
in 
God 
s 
election 
so 
appealing 
to 
John 
makes 
no 
sense 
He 
ordained 
the 
murder 
of 
His 
own 
son 
yet 
condemned 
it 
at 
the 
same 
time 
God 
is 
sovereign 
over 
all 
affairs 
including 
matters 
of 
the 
state 
The 
NT 
makes 
this 
crystal 
clear 
God 
has 
given 
us 
a 
peek 
behind 
the 
curtain 
about 
this 
He 
shows 
mercy 
on 
who 
He 
wills 
and 
He 
hardens 
who 
He 
wills 
Well 
since 
your 
camp 
has 
an 
escapist 
view 
I 
don 
t 
have 
to 
worry 
about 
you 
guys 
getting 
power 
and 
being 
able 
to 
legally 
do 
something 
about 
what 
I 
say 
I 
deny 
nothing 
I 
love 
the 
whole 
council 
of

Not

If 
they 
hate 
blasphemy 
against 
God 
as 
poison 
for 
society 
they 
can 
do 
something 
about 
it 
legally 
What 
does

say 
about 
blasphemers 
Now 
you 
can 
say 
the 
law 
t 
apply 
today 
but 
that 
still 
t 
change 
the 
content 
of 
God

character 
He

them 
as

If

your

get 
sent 
to 
hell 
for 
the

of

If

If 
your

renounce

that 
once

I

in 
no

describe 
my 
experience 
as 
making 
a 
decision

Jesus 
I 
can 
t 
even 
really 
explain 
it 
logically 
It 
was

It 
was

experienced

experienced

heard 
the 
invitation 
s 
of 
times 
I 
hated

out

they

And 
since 
nobody 
is 
capable 
of 
doing 
this 
without

the

the 
one 
the 
atonement 
does 
not 
apply 
to 
This 
is 
why 
we 
talk 
about 
limited 
atonement

that 
the 
phrase

You

about

thing

u 
The 
people 
who 
are 
atoned 
for 
Now 
keep 
in 
mind 
the 
atonement 
is 
the 
sacrifice 
that 
reconciles 
fallen 
man 
with 
God 
If 
you 
t 
reconciled 
then 
you 
re 
not 
atoned

u 
I 
sometimes 
put 
it 
like 
this 
the 
atonement 
is 
Christ 
taking 
a 
bullet 
for 
you 
so 
that 
you 
can 
live 
Now 
if 
he 
took 
a 
bullet 
for 
everyone 
then 
it 
would 
mean 
nobody 
experiences 
eternal 
death 
u 
Now 
what 
is 
atonement 
It 
is 
the 
actual 
reconciliation 
of 
God 
and 
man 
through 
Jesus 
Christ 
Who 
is 
the 
atonement 
limited 
to 
Those 
who 
are 
actually 
reconciled 
to 
God

Define 
the 
terms 
What 
is 
limited 
atonement 
u 
Well 
if 
you 
want 
to 
throw 
out 
symbolism 
and 
typology 
then 
the 
only 
thing 
Christ 
did 
on 
the 
cross 
was 
bleed 
a 
lot 
just 
like 
all 
the 
other 
people 
getting 
crucified 
around

Seriously 
you 
got 
so 
many 
theological 
problems 
infant 
baptism 
is 
the 
least 
of 
your 
concerns 
Now 
you 
re 
free 
to 
not 
do 
it 
but 
don 
t 
take 
your 
kids 
to 
church 
church 
is 
for 
believers 
and 
preach 
hellfire 
to 
them 
constantly 
u 
It 
s 
the 
same 
system 
Converts 
get 
the 
sacrament 
after 
belief 
Children 
of 
believers 
get 
it 
after 
birth 
Hence 
the 
household 
baptisms 
Hence 
the 
overwhelming 
historical 
evidence 
Nobody 
had 
a 
problem 
for 
like 
years 
It 
s 
how 
we 
do 
it 
in 
our 
faith 
u 
A 
gentile 
convert 
prior 
to 
the 
cross 
had 
to 
believe 
and 
get 
circumcised 
along 
with 
the 
whole 
family 
Any 
subsequent 
children 
of 
a 
circumcised 
believer 
was 
circumcised 
on 
the 
th 
day 
Paul 
says 
the 
sign 
of 
circumcision 
has 
been 
replaced 
by 
the 
sign 
of 
baptism 
u 
You 
re 
thinking 
like 
someone 
a 
western 
nuclear 
family 
Ancient 
households 
included 
large 
extended 
families 
They 
had 
a 
child 
like 
every 
couple 
of 
years 
during 
childbearing 
years 
Practically 
every 
house 
had 
infants 
in 
it 
u 
I 
know 
the 
th 
command 
triggers 
but 
that 
s 
what 
happened 
We 
have 
historical 
evidence 
that 
long 
predates 
the 
existence 
of 
a 
Pope 
Circumcise 
infants 
into 
the 
covenant 
becomes 
baptizing 
them 
I 
m 
not 
telling 
you 
to 
do 
this 
I 
m 
saying 
this 
affects 
how 
we 
treat 
our 
children 
u 
Here 
s 
the 
formula 
The 
head 
of 
the 
house 
converts 
The 
head 
of 
the 
house 
says 
I 
am 
the 
head 
of 
the 
house 
I 
am 
a 
Christian 
This 
is 
a 
Christian 
household 
I 
have 
the 
authority 
to 
do 
this 
Everyone 
gets 
baptized 
u 
And 
he 
Paul 
took 
them 
the 
same 
hour 
of 
the 
night 
and 
washed 
their 
wounds 
and 
he 
was 
baptized 
at 
once 
he 
and 
all 
his 
family 
I 
Paul 
did 
baptize 
also 
the 
household

For 
the

off

whom 
the 
Lord 
our 
God 
calls 
to 
himself 
The 
Lord 
opened 
her 
heart 
psst 
regeneration 
to 
pay 
attention 
to 
what 
was 
said 
by 
Paul 
And 
after 
she 
was 
baptized 
and 
her 
household 
as 
well

Are 
you 
being 
facetious 
u 
If 
you 
mean 
catholic 
as 
in 
universal 
then 
it 
sure 
is 
If 
you 
mean 
Roman 
Catholic 
then 
The 
apostles 
baptized 
entire 
households 
A 
father 
s 
responsibility 
to 
raise 
children 
in 
the 
covenant 
community 
That 
means 
baptize 
them 
u 
We 
presume 
all 
covenant 
children 
are 
elect 
as 
a 
default 
attitude 
We 
raise 
them 
to 
grow 
in 
faith 
and 
wisdom 
in 
our 
Lord 
u 
There 
is 
no 
blind 
luck 
and 
chance 
in 
a 
world 
in 
which 
God 
is 
sovereign 
Be 
careful

those 
humanist 
assumptions

What 
good 
does 
it 
do 
for 
the 
reprobate 
Nothing 
It 
s 
actually 
worse 
for

Knowing 
the 
truth

turning 
from 
it

harsher

The 
average 
Christian 
is 
on 
a 
spiritual 
diet 
of 
milk 
years 
upon 
year 
upon 
years 
after 
coming 
to 
faith 
We 
start 
them 
on 
milk 
before 
they 
can 
even 
speak 
and 
solid 
food 
as 
soon 
as 
they 
can 
talk 
They 
are 
the 
covenant 
children 
u 
We 
assume 
that 
the 
promise 
of 
God 
s 
favor 
is 
for 
us 
and 
our 
children 
We 
treat 
them 
as 
elect 
u 
We 
baptize 
them 
as 
infants 
into 
the 
church 
Then 
we 
bring 
them 
to 
our 
services 
rather 
than 
put 
them 
in 
a 
babysitting 
room 
Then 
we 
instruct 
them 
in 
the 
Smaller 
Catechisms 
first 
and 
other 
standards 
later 
Our 
year 
olds 
know 
more 
than 
the 
average

Yes 
That 
s 
a 
real 
promise 
from 
a 
real 
God 
who 
has 
real 
power

real 
dominion 
and 
real 
sovereignty 
forever 
and 
ever

u 
In 
Paul 
s 
day 
there 
was 
the 
sentiment 
of 
the 
humanists 
who 
cried 
out 
well 
why 
did 
God 
make 
me 
this 
way 
Why 
does 
He 
find 
fault 
Who 
can 
resist 
His 
will 
Paul 
dignified 
them 
with 
a 
big 
fat

down

up

is

Don 
t 
forget 
it 
u 
Like 
I 
said 
there 
is 
no 
doctrine 
of 
Free 
Will 
in 
our 
scriptures 
You 
have 
to 
import 
this 
foreign 
pagan 
idea 
into 
our 
text 
We 
know 
the 
history 
of 
this 
idea 
We 
know 
how 
it 
entered 
the 
church 
I 
am 
warning 
you 
of 
the 
implications 
u 
As 
Christians 
it 
s 
our 
role 
to 
warn 
each 
other 
of 
sin 
with 
the 
word 
of 
God 
You 
need 
to 
stop 
importing 
this 
libertarian 
attitude 
into 
the 
church 
We 
watch 
out 
for 
each 
other 
u 
God 
is 
certain 
We 
have 
faith 
in 
Him 
u 
I 
m 
trying 
to 
warn 
you 
that 
you 
smuggled 
humanism 
into 
your 
theology 
Christ 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
humanism 
People 
who 
embrace 
humanism 
even 
the 
most 
intellectual 
of 
intellectuals 
are 
futile 
in 
their 
reasoning 
including 
their 
categories 
and 
ethics 
and 
all 
things 
u 
Because 
their 
father 
is 
Satan 
and 
they 
share 
the 
same 
fate 
as 
him 
u 
We 
know 
WHAT

hates 
We 
do 
not

WHO 
God 
hates 
Please 
respect 
the 
creator 
creature 
distinction 
u 
It 
s 
not 
the 
good 
news 
to 
humanists 
as 
long 
as 
they 
remain 
humanists 
u 
Humanism 
has 
as 
much 
with 
being 
human 
as 
feminism 
has 
to 
do 
with 
being 
a 
woman 
They 
are 
worldly 
philosophies 
Humanism 
and 
Christianity 
are 
antithetical 
u 
Is 
that 
cruel 
Your 
humanism 
is 
showing 
Who 
is 
your 
LORD 
Do 
you

what

loves 
Do 
you

Do 
you

Him

for 
everyone 
He 
died 
to 
save 
the 
elect 
and

in 
of 
the 
reprobate 
We 
don 
t 
know 
who 
is 
who

either 
way 
it 
furthers 
God

plan 
of 
dispensing 
blessing 
and 
cursing

is 
our 
purpose 
God 
saved 
us 
for 
good 
works

salvation

not 
really 
Reformed 
As 
weird 
as 
it 
sounds 
it 
s 
a 
debate 
between 
two 
camps 
Lordship 
Salvation 
is 
advanced 
by 
the 
Calvinistic 
Methodist 
camp 
I 
m 
not 
in 
that 
club 
u 
All 
that 
the 
Father 
grants 
him 
u 
I 
t 
say 
you 
worshiped 
it 
It 
s 
part 
of 
your 
gospel 
though 
Jesus 
died 
for 
you 
and 
he 
wants 
you 
to 
choose 
him 
as 
your 
I

savior 
Give 
him 
a 
try 
What 
harm 
will 
it 
do 
u 
Have 
you 
ever 
talked 
to 
a 
radical 
progressive 
who 
claims 
to 
be 
a 
Christian 
Radical 
progressivism 
did 
not 
exist 
at 
the 
time 
of

It

somehow 
they

foreign

I 
watch

you

Where 
in 
the

does 
it 
mention 
we 
lost 
our 
freewill 
We 
lost

We 
lost 
innocence 
We 
lost 
nearness 
to 
God 
and 
nearness 
to 
God 
translates 
into 
holiness 
I 
avoid 
using 
freewill

it 
s 
an 
external 
concept

muddles

making 
an 
argument 
from 
the 
history 
of 
ideas 
is 
thoroughly 
biblical 
which 
is 
why 
all 
Jewish 
sects 
ascribed 
to 
it 
except 
the 
Sadducee 
they 
rejected 
scripture 
as 
God 
breathed 
and 
why 
the 
apostles 
spoke 
about 
predestination 
prophecy 
etc 
u 
First 
Josephus 
was 
not 
a 
stoic 
or 
He 
knew 
about 
them 
because 
he 
was 
educated 
in 
a 
wide 
array 
of 
subjects 
just 
like 
Paul 
and 
scholars 
have 
made 
the 
same 
claim 
about 
him 
More 
importantly 
where 
was 
your 
position 
during 
the 
times 
of 
Jesus 
u 
The 
only 
ones 
who 
bought 
into 
an 
primitive 
form 
of 
were 
the 
Sadducee 
They 
were 
completely 
heretical 
not 
hypocrites 
like 
the 
Pharisee 
They 
justified 
their 
free 
will 
arguments 
on 
the 
claim 
that 
God 
is 
weak 
and 
far 
away 
This 
is 
how 
it 
tends 
to 
go 
u 
The 
problem 
with 
the 
Pharisees 
is 
that 
they 
held 
to 
theoretically 
because 
it 
is 
completely 
biblical 
but 
they 
acted 
in 
a 
way 
that 
was 
totally 
opposed 
to 
that 
position 
They 
took 
credit 
for 
what 
they 
did 
rather 
then 
give 
credit 
to 
God 
Jesus 
called 
them 
hypocrites

rejected

m

Since

ancient

The

example 
of 
it

the

God 
gave 
us 
dominion 
over

stock

created 
predators

Does 
it 
make 
sense 
for 
His

to 
be 
in 
tension

If 
you

Just 
speaking 
solely

The 
in

This

more 
of 
an 
idea 
popular 
among

the

up

monopolized 
education 
so 
that 
this

To

Think 
of 
Jeremiah 
when 
he 
became 
a 
prophet 
He 
heard 
a 
voice 
that 
was 
not 
literally 
there 
Then 
he 
was 
told 
to 
announce 
what 
he 
saw 
An 
almond

Read

But 
still 
that

Difficulty

Witty

In 
a 
sense 
I 
agree

The 
liberal 
expression 
of 
Christianity 
is 
an 
entirely 
different 
religion 
with 
an

The

where

honestly 
who

but 
still 
irrational 
phenomenon 
of 
Learning 
about 
the 
position

musical 
instruments 
in

were 
shadows

passed

Something 
new 
to 
learn 
today 
reformed 
covenant 
theology 
is 
not 
a

Reformed

in

to

One

But 
the 
and 
ism 
t

Then 
take 
out 
of 
your 
vocabulary 
I

You 
are 
a 
Labels 
we 
all 
do 
it 
Reformed 
people 
are 
trinitarians 
It 
would 
be 
blasphemous 
to 
call 
the 
third 
person 
of 
the 
trinity 
a 
bot 
Nobody 
would 
say 
that 
Now 
if 
you 
don 
t 
want 
to 
know 
about 
it 
I 
suggest 
simply 
not 
talking 
about 
it 
Am 
I 
talking 
to 
a 
random 
bible 
verse 
generating

I 
don 
t

this 
is 
a 
real 
conversation 
So 
you 
can 
make 
ignorant 
accusations 
about 
other 
people 
s 
positions 
and 
when 
you 
are 
called 
out 
then 
you 
can 
claim 
a 
made 
up 
biblical 
imperative 
to 
be 
ignorant 
What 
about 
the 
imperative 
to 
not 
talk 
foolishly 
or 
slander 
Do 
you 
really 
think 
that 
reformed 
people 
deny 
that 
Jesus 
was 
predestined 
It 
is 
more 
of 
a 
problem 
for 
who 
lack 
a 
fully 
formed 
conception 
of 
sanctification 
especially 
the 
progressive 
aspect 
of 
it 
It 
is 
not 
a 
problem 
for 
the 
non 
reformed 
position 
Jesus 
came 
into 
the 
world 
for 
the

This 
is

With 
regards 
to 
Christian 
music 
I 
think 
it 
has 
more 
to 
do 
with 
Christianity 
being 
seen 
as 
a 
viable 
market 
if 
approached 
in

formulaic 
lowest

painting 
with 
a 
large 
brush 
are 
taking 
the

forms 
and 
making 
them 
worse 
aesthetically 
And 
I 
don 
t 
want 
to 
come 
across 
like 
saying 
if 
you 
re 
doing 
music 
you 
should 
do 
what 
Handel 
did 
That 
s 
looking 
backwards 
too 
much 
With 
today 
s 
technology 
you 
can 
make 
a 
BIG 
sound 
aiming 
towards 
TRANSCENDENCE

am

pretty 
new

I 
don

know 
the 
depth 
of 
contemporary 
Christian 
culture 
but 
I 
don 
t 
think 
someone 
like 
Handel 
was 
treating 
his 
music 
primarily 
as 
secular 
outreach 
or 
a 
religious 
alternative 
that 
tries 
to 
emulate 
the 
world 
with 
Jesus 
thrown 
in 
Before 
Christian 
culture 
started 
making 
pop 
songs

basically 
signified

West 
B 
u 
Well 
sometimes 
you 
have 
to 
simplify 
things 
Part 
of 
the 
problem 
for 
Israel 
is 
they 
had 
fulfilled 
prophecies 
that 
they 
refused 
to 
acknowledge 
because 
it 
t 
live 
up 
to 
their 
expectations 
They 
heard 
things 
would 
be 
great 
but 
when 
they 
t 
perfect 
they 
assumed 
God 
failed

It 
is 
not

oh 
I 
t 
understand

Pythagorean 
theorem

then 
I 
tried 
harder 
and 
now 
I 
understand 
it 
thanks 
to 
being 
a 
good 
student 
u 
The 
point 
is 
that 
while 
the 
person 
was 
not 
reconciled 
with 
God 
for 
a 
time 
his 
effectual 
calling 
was 
known 
and 
ordained 
by 
God 
and 
not 
simply 
a 
matter 
of 
autonomously 
grasping 
the 
gospel 
as 
if 
the 
gospel 
was 
comparable 
to 
any 
other 
common 
set 
of 
ideas 
u 
That 
s 
a 
very 
common 
experience

I 
did 
not

God

patient 
He 
t 
give 
out 
prophecies 
incalculable 
measurements

Sound 
like 
a 
productive 
discussion 
u 
To 
bring 
free 
will 
into 
the 
discussion 
is 
to 
play 
make 
believe 
about 
pointless 
u 
God 
s 
will 
is 
an 
extension 
of 
His 
Nature 
as 
a 
Holy 
God 
He 
is 
Holy 
so 
He 
acts 
Holy 
He 
is 
not 
unholy 
so 
He 
does 
not 
act 
unholy 
Introducing 
Free 
Will 
into 
the 
discussion 
only 
muddles 
things 
u 
Then 
He 
chooses 
to 
be 
Holy 
u 
That 
is 
a 
nice 
man 
made 
philosophy 
u 
Okay 
so 
your 
position 
is 
that 
God 
s 
Holiness 
is 
optional 
and 
not 
a 
necessary 
feature 
of 
His 
nature 
Do 
you 
want 
to 
rethink 
that 
u 
I 
d 
like 
to 
see 
a 
prophecy 
that 
have 
agreed 
upon 
as 
being 
completely 
fulfilled

You

recordings 
of 
all 
of

brought 
up

One 
of 
the

been 
freely

Maybe 
you 
t 
using 
that 
word 
correctly 
u 
t 
co 
u 
I 
m 
sorry 
but 
that 
s 
an 
asinine 
statement 
u 
Yes 
yes 
yes 
He 
saved 
us 
He 
regenerated 
us 
to 
spiritual 
life 
and 
opened 
up 
our 
understanding 
of 
our 
deadness 
We 
understood 
that 
we 
need

We 
went 
to

How 
is 
this 
controversial 
u 
Let 
s 
take 
another 
type 
of 
experience 
An 
unbeliever 
gets 
dragged 
to 
a 
revival 
by 
a 
friend 
and 
hears 
some 
preaching 
Something 
i 
e 
regeneration 
comes 
over 
the 
unbeliever 
prior 
to 
and 
leading 
up 
to 
conversion 
If 
that 
something 
t 
happen 
they 
would 
not 
have 
converted 
u 
If 
you 
have 
a 
conversion 
story 
then 
you 
may 
also 
have 
a 
rejection 
story 
If 
so 
then 
why 
did 
you 
reject 
Was 
it 
a 
bad 
preacher 
man 
If 
he 
only 
preached 
a 
little 
better 
he 
might 
have 
won 
you 
over 
that 
day 
Seriously 
what 
changed 
u 
Regeneration 
points 
to 
Jesus 
who 
points 
to 
justification 
which 
points 
to 
adoption 
which 
points 
to 
eternal

BY 
the 
washing 
of 
REGENERATION

RENEWAL

the 
Holy 
Spirit

he 
poured 
out 
on 
us 
richly 
through 
Jesus 
Christ 
our

SO 
THAT 
being 
JUSTIFIED 
by 
his

we 
might 
become

Titus

Even 
the 
Pharisees

not 
articulate

doctrine

autonomous 
free 
will 
in 
the 
way 
you 
speak

it

Jesus 
blasted

show

the

translation 
especially 
at 
the 
end 
of 
Revelation 
where 
the

mistranslates

there

I 
have 
been 
defending 
Biblical 
authority 
from 
false 
teachers 
telling 
Christians 
that 
the 
Bible 
is 
only 
authoritative 
in 
some 
of

writings

they 
can 
t 
even 
interpret

So 
why 
impose 
all 
these 
secular 
humanist 
ideals 
on

O

u 
God 
is 
not

That 
would 
create

many

desire 
for 
autonomous

probably

In 
part 
it 
was 
to 
train 
His 
people 
to 
think 
in 
those 
terms 
In 
a 
sense 
it 
is 
the 
way 
that 
God 
thinks 
or 
at 
least 
communicates 
to 
us 
We 
need 
to 
get 
a

Common

is 
often 
the

side

said 
is 
you 
have 
no 
argument 
against 
them 
You 
thrown 
out 
God 
s 
law 
so 
now 
you 
re 
in 
the 
same 
boat 
as 
the 
atheist 
crying 
about 
the 
immorality 
of 
someone 
mugging 
them 
u 
Thou 
shalt 
not 
murder 
sickening 
Thou 
shalt 
not 
sacrifice 
to 
demons 
sickening 
Thou 
shalt 
honor 
your 
parents 
sickening 
u 
Again 
you 
re 
attacking 
a 
position 
that 
nobody 
maintains 
All 
you 
re 
doing 
is 
showing 
your 
knee 
jerk 
hostility 
to 
basic 
issues 
surrounding 
the 
Christian 
walk 
which 
you 
apparently 
can 
t 
differentiate 
from 
the 
lowest 
common 
denominator 
of 
getting 
your 
ticket 
punched 
u 
I 
appreciate 
your 
effort 
to 
be 
consistent 
on 
paper 
but 
when 
you 
follow 
this 
stuff 
through 
logically 
it 
produces 
absurd 
results 
u 
With 
all 
due 
respect 
you 
act 
like 
saying 
Christians 
should 
not 
murder 
their 
parents 
in 
their 
sleep 
for 
a 
satanic 
ritual 
is 
legalism 
and 
self 
righteousness 
and 
a 
burden 
on 
believers 
u 
Re 
singing 
Psalms 
t 
save 
you 
is 
a 
refutation 
of 
a 
position 
that 
literally 
nobody 
has 
ever 
held 
The 
point 
is 
Paul 
instructs 
the 
churches 
to 
have 
an 
expression 
of 
Christianity 
that 
is 
more 
than 
getting 
your 
heaven 
ticket 
punched 
u 
I 
am 
proving 
how 
extreme 
your 
positions 
are 
and 
that 
one 
can 
t 
open 
up 
a 
page 
of 
Paul 
without 
finding 
ammo 
against 
Mid 
Acts 
doctrine 
u 
Paul 
was 
a 
bad 
Mid 
Acts 
addressing 
one 
another 
in 
psalms 
and 
hymns 
He 
should 
have 
cut 
out 
the 
psalms 
He 
t 
have 
instructed 
believers 
to 
do 
anything 
Faith 
alone 
not 
faith 
songs 
u 
Allow 
me 
to 
clarify 
said 
there 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
saving 
faith 
I 
said 
plenty 
of 
people 
have 
faith 
that 
will 
not 
save 
and 
gave 
a 
list 
of 
examples 
u 
On 
another 
note 
I 
like 
how 
it 
played 
up 
the 
paradox 
element 
in 
wisdom 
lit 
I 
find 
those 
who 
operate 
in 
a 
hyper 
literal 
framework 
find 
this 
common 
feature 
in 
scripture 
to 
be 
a 
major 
stumbling 
block 
u 
I 
am 
not 
on 
the 
best 
device 
for 
reading 
right 
now 
but 
t 
it 
speak 
of 
imputed 
righteousness 
in 
connection 
with 
justification 
rather 
than 
simple 
righteousness 
u 
The 
object 
u 
t 
co 
u 
Like 
I 
said 
you 
are 
stuck 
You 
have 
the 
veil 
as 
u 
You 
can 
have 
faith 
in 
Jesus 
the 
non 
material 
spirit 
being 
You 
can 
have 
faith 
in 
Jesus 
a 
created 
being 
You 
can 
have 
faith 
in 
Jesus 
who 
is 
not 
king 
of 
the 
heaven 
and 
earth 
u 
Just 
playing 
I 
have 
lost 
count 
of 
the 
number 
of 
people 
who 
have 
already 
showed 
that 
to 
you 
and 
it 
makes 
no 
difference 
You 
are 
stuck 
u 
So 
if 
I 
found 
Paul 
talking 
about 
saving 
faith 
working 
will 
you 
admit 
you 
were 
splitting 
hairs 
u 
Should 
I 
do 
it 
again 
u 
This 
has 
already 
been 
shown 
to 
you 
The 
only 
thing 
you 
proved 
is 
you 
do 
not 
want 
to 
see 
the 
harmony 
u 
Written 
to 
the 
church 
Written 
to 
the 
church 
in 
the 
first 
century 
Israel 
was 
the 
oppressor 
They 
sung 
psalms 
calling 
for 
Israel 
s 
destruction 
for 
spilling 
the 
blood 
of 
Christians 
u 
I 
already 
have 
reconciled 
them 
You 
close 
your 
ears 
though 
u 
They 
wrote 
to 
Christians 
I 
repeat 
they 
wrote 
to 
Christians 
Why 
were 
they 
scattered 
Because 
Israel 
was 
persecuting 
them 
They 
were 
not 
writing 
to 
their 
oppressors 
u 
That 
is 
why 
you 
see 
a 
mass 
of 
contradiction 
You 
do 
not 
see 
the 
unfolding 
You 
want 
to 
flatten 
it 
all 
out 
into 
a 
joke 
u 
Israel 
meant 
the 
northern 
kingdom 
at 
times 
u 
Israel 
is 
used 
as 
a 
term 
that 
some 
times 
only 
means 
the 
northern 
kingdom 
u 
So 
the 
whole 
first 
to 
the 
Jews 
then 
to 
the 
gentiles 
reprise 
did 
not 
stick 
How 
do 
you 
split 
a 
hair

denounce 
liberal 
theology 
but 
they

in 
the

The 
writers 
want 
you 
to 
see 
it 
too

The

believed 
that

would

I 
thought 
you 
were 
supposed 
to 
disagree 
with

accuse

of 
misrepresenting

position 
Do 
you 
pray 
to 
Paul

Am 
I

accusation

Misapplication 
I 
was 
attempting 
to 
characterize 
your 
position 
nobody 
gets 
to 
the 
Father 
except 
through 
your 
abhorrent 
misconception 
of 
Paul 
You 
replaced 
Jesus 
with 
a 
fake 
Paul 
u 
You 
re 
still 
thinking 
like 
a 
zealot 
u 
You 
are 
taking 
the 
earthly 
heaven 
difference 
and 
turning 
it 
into 
a 
dichotomy 
The 
Kingdom 
of 
God 
Heaven 
is 
about 
breaking 
the 
dichotomy 
on 
earth 
as 
it 
is 
in 
heaven 
and 
in 
order 
to 
get 
that 
you 
have 
to 
stop

like 
a

u 
Wow 
there 
s 
a 
lot 
of 
wrong 
going 
on 
here 
You 
think 
like 
a 
zealot 
thinks 
of 
the 
kingdom 
Why 
is 
there 
so 
little 
influence 
People 
like 
you 
have 
abandoned 
your 
responsibilities 
and 
God 
does 
what 
He 
always 
does 
sends 
our 
enemies 
against 
us 
u 
Secondly 
proper 
exegesis 
is 
more 
than 
who 
what 
where 
when 
and 
why 
There 
is 
There 
is 
understanding 
the 
figures 
of 
speech 
There 
are 
unstated 
assumptions 
forming 
the 
logic 
and 
coherence 
There 
is 
the 
spirit 
at

The 
comments 
were 
on 
the 
subject 
of

Let 
me 
translate 
for 
you 
don 
t 
follow 
the 
heretics 
follow 
me 
What 
it 
does 
NOT 
say 
don 
t 
follow 
Jesus 
Peter 
John 
James 
or 
Jude 
follow 
me 
because 
this 
is 
the 
cult 
of 
Paul 
nobody 
gets 
to 
the 
Father 
except 
through 
me 
u 
If 
we 
wanted 
to 
play 
semantics 
we 
are 
closer 
to 
a 
world 
empire 
than 
a 
nation 
with 
borders 
u 
Like 
I 
said 
it 
s 
the 
same 
methodology 
with 
a 
different 
person 
to 
misrepresent 
For 
example 
the 
text 
just 
quoted 
above 
was 
directed 
towards 
heretics 
and 
is 
applied 
by 
towards 
Christ 
and 
the 
apostles 
thus 
making 
them 
heretics 
u 
Red 
letterers 
are 
just 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
coin 
of 
what 
you 
re 
doing 
asserting 
they 
are 
rightly 
dividing 
while 
misrepresenting 
the 
Jesus 
as 
they 
slice 
and 
dice 
the 
text 
to 
justify 
their 
own 
misrepresentations 
u 
No 
it 
was 
u 
And 
now 
I 
am 
blocked 
u 
Are 
you 
saying 
if 
I 
dropped 
more 
proof 
texts 
that 
would 
change 
your 
mind 
because 
you 
are 
not 
totally 
dug 
into 
your 
position 
u 
There 
is 
no 
wrong 
apostle 
You 
have 
twisted 
Paul 
so 
much 
that 
you 
can 
t 
reconcile 
him 
with 
anyone 
in 
scripture 
so 
you 
have 
to 
invent 
this 
monstrosity 
to 
repair 
the 
initial 
misconception 
thus 
digging 
a 
deeper 
hole 
of 
misconception 
You 
are 
mangling 
everything 
u 
The 
people 
who 
despise 
Paul 
are 
the 
ones 
who 
twist 
his 
words 
to 
say 
what 
they 
do 
not 
say 
u 
That 
is 
an 
impossible 
explanation 
The 
OT 
prophets 
knew 
the 
world 
would 
come 
to 
worship 
Yahweh 
the 
Messiah

new 
covenant 
Paul 
seems 
to 
be 
referring 
to 
something 
extremely 
narrow 
and 
surface 
level 
u 
do 
not 
see 
the 
connection 
between 
the 
bride 
metaphor

They

disconnected 
the 
big 
picture 
into 
atoms 
u 
Does 
the 
parallel 
just 
go 
over 
your 
head 
or 
do 
you 
see 
it 
and 
suppress 
it 
by 
chanting 
the 
mantra 
The 
NT 
authors 
intend 
you 
to 
see 
it 
u 
The 
lack 
of 
a 
specific 
reference 
from 
Paul 
using 
the 
figure 
keys 
is 
so 
beyond 
the 
point

Nice

Not

That 
is 
not 
an 
answer 
Yes 
or 
no 
would 
be 
fine 
Are 
you 
afraid 
to 
be 
open 
u 
Even 
die 
as 
a 
satanist

So 
I 
take 
it 
that 
you 
believe 
there 
are 
saved 
devil 
worshipers 
out 
there 
and 
I 
have 
some 
kind 
of 
problem 
of 
legalism 
for 
raising 
a 
question 
about 
it 
Okay 
u 
That 
is 
hyper 
literal

e 
over

That 
is 
not

clear 
answer

Where 
do 
you 
get 
all

So 
if 
you 
decided 
to 
become 
a 
satanist

you 
die 
that 
way

you 
are 
still

If 
you 
don

have 
to

why 
not 
just 
give 
up 
now

apostatize 
Is 
that

you 
are 
saying

Yes

they 
did 
happen

it 
was

It

You 
had

You 
can 
repeat 
yourself

that 
s 
not

make 
ancient 
people

is

u 
Daniel 
said 
that 
the 
Messiah 
would 
be 
cut 
off 
This 
is 
why 
I 
don 
t 
get 
this 
whole 
perspective 
of 
a 
Plan 
B 
or 
well 
if 
the 
Jews 
accepted 
Jesus 
then 
It 
was 
never 
going 
to 
happen 
or 
Daniel 
would 
be 
a 
false 
prophet 
u 
If 
Paul 
wrote 
down 
in 
our 
Holy 
Scripture 
that 
something 
big 
was 
about 
to 
soon 
take 
place 
and 
he 
completely 
misjudged 
how 
long 
it 
would 
be 
i 
e 
not 
soon 
at 
all 
then 
that 
raises 
questions 
of 
whether 
he 
was 
writing 
scripture 
or 
just 
his 
own 
thoughts 
u 
The 
early 
Church 
used 
this 
fulfilled 
prophecy 
as 
an 
apologetic 
tool 
They 
understood 
that 
Jesus 
prophecy 
came 
to 
pass 
precisely 
as 
he 
said 
it 
would 
u 
So 
you 
just 
inserted 
an 
element 
of 
error 
into 
the 
text 
Do 
you 
really 
want 
that 
and 
all 
the 
implications 
that 
go 
along 
with 
that

Think 
about 
it

that 
in 
Daniel 
Israel 
would 
get 
their 
long 
awaited 
Messiah 
and 
cut 
him 
off 
and 
have 
their 
temple 
destroyed 
They 
were 
blinded 
so 
prophecy 
could 
be 
fulfilled 
as 
it 
already 
has 
been 
fulfilled 
u 
Romans 
explains 
how 
the 
th 
week 
was 
able 
to 
happen 
in 
the 
first 
place 
You 
admit 
that 
Paul 
thought 
something 
was 
going 
to 
happen 
soon 
Why 
Because 
he 
t 
have 
an 
astrophysicist 
interpretation 
The 
old 
social 
order 
was 
ending 
very 
soon 
u 
Yep 
and 
I 
don 
t 
want 
to 
put 
my 
faith 
in 
a 
false 
prophet 
BTW 
being 
a 
false 
prophet 
is 
a 
sin 
of 
the 
highest 
order 
Jesus 
can 
t 
atone 
for 
sin 
if 
he 
is 
a 
false 
prophet 
u 
It 
explains 
scripture 
and 
proves 
without 
a 
doubt 
that 
it 
is 
from 
God 
Unbelievers 
are 
going 
to 
laugh 
at 
us 
but 
let 
s 
not 
give 
them 
ammunition 
All 
this 
talk 
of 
long 
lists 
of 
indefinitely 
delayed 
prophecies 
is 
embarrassing 
u 
Dude 
you 
have 
to 
invent 
this 
other 
temple 
that 
will 
never 
exist 
so 
things 
can 
play 
out 
exactly 
as 
they 
already 
did 
It 
already 
happened 
The 
problem 
is 
your 
conception 
of 
the 
prophetic 
idiom 
and 
modern 
assumptions 
u 
Are 
they 
going 
to 
get 
those 
stones 
back 
The 
stones 
Jesus 
was 
talking 
about 
Are 
they 
going 
to 
use 
those 
same 
stones 
and 
rebuild 
the 
temple 
No 
They 
are 
dust 
now 
It 
s 
over 
Accept 
it 
u 
Was 
the 
temple 
destroyed 
If 
it 
has 
been 
then 
that 
means 
you 
are 
thinking 
about 
these 
terms 
incorrectly 
u 
You 
re 
thinking 
about 
the 
world 
like 
a 
modern 
astrophysicist 
That 
s 
not 
what 
they 
were 
talking 
about 
It 
s 
the 
social 
order 
You 
at 
times 
recognize 
that 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
temple 
marked 
an 
end 
but 
follow 
it 
through 
u 
He 
was 
talking 
about 
the 
second 
temple 
The 
one 
they 
were 
just 
at 
The 
stones 
they 
just 
saw 
Then 
he 
says 
this 
generation 
circa 
years 
will 
see 
it 
s 
end 
They 
did 
The 
prophecy 
is 
fulfilled 
u 
If 
you 
equate 
the 
Discourse 
with 
the 
final 
then 
you 
re 
mixing 
things 
up 
u 
How 
would 
you 
know 
You 
refuse 
to 
come 
face 
to 
face 
with 
it 
u 
We 
will 
be 
pilgrims 
there 
Resurrection 
bound 
u 
The 
real 
issue 
is 
this 
Jesus 
said 
that 
those 
things 
would 
happen 
in 
that 
time 
frame 
Why 
don 
t 
you 
believe 
him 
Why 
do 
you 
nitpick 
everything 
to 
the 
point 
that 
you 
make 
everyone 
in 
the 
NT 
a 
false 
prophet 
Why 
would 
you 
put 
your 
faith 
in 
the 
teachings 
of 
false 
prophets 
u 
t 
co 
e 
Zn 
u 
how 
would 
you 
know 
You 
claim 
to 
only 
read 
the 
and 
you 
don 
t 
care 
about 
history 
Well 
all 
the 
Christians 
left 
Jerusalem 
by 
that 
point 
so 
there 
is 
only 
non 
Christian 
witnesses 
to 
the 
earthly 
events 
and 
you 
won 
t 
read 
them 
u 
Those 
who 
the 
spirit 
did 
not 
give 
ears 
will 
not 
hear 
it 
Now 
you 
might 
ask 
well 
why 
make 
the 
preaching 
necessary 
in 
the 
first 
place 
Answer 
to 
build 
the 
church 
It 
s 
not 
all 
about 
going 
to 
heaven 
The 
church 
has 
work 
on 
earth 
I 
ordered 
my 
niece 
this 
coloring 
book 
for 
her 
birthday 
Big 
pictures 
few 
words 
And 
then 
it 
started 
getting 
WEIRD 
When 
This 
week 
is 
a 
bonus 
episode 
while 
we 
gear 
up 
for 
episode 
This 
one 
is 
a 
sermon 
I 
preached 
in 
New 
Zealand 
last 
month 
Th 
u 
The 
entire 
framework 
of 
Mid 
Acts 
as 
I 
understand 
it 
thinks 
that 
all 
of 
Revelation 
is 
future 
Let 
that 
sink 
in 
John 
wrote 
about 
the 
church 
at 
Ephesus 
accusing 
of 
them 
of 
this 
or 
that 
but 
it 
t 
actually 
them 
It 
was 
a 
future 
church 
thousands 
of 
years 
later 
u 
He 
also 
says 
those 
without 
ears 
figuratively 
won 
t 
hear 
what 
the 
Spirit 
says 
in 
the 
letters 
to 
the 
seven 
churches 
so 
they 
won 
t 
respond 
to 
what 
they 
can 
t 
hear 
See 
how 
this 
works 
Invisible 
precedes 
the 
visible 
u 
Make 
up 
your 
mind 
about 
Revelation 
u 
Conversion 
is 
Trinitarian 
all 
the 
way 
through 
If 
that 
t 
your 
experience 
then 
trust 
scripture 
in 
saying 
what 
was 
going 
on 
behind 
the 
scenes 
If 
you 
reject 
that 
then 
I 
hope 
it 
is 
out 
of 
arrogance 
and 
not 
fact 
u 
It 
says 
nothing 
like 
and 
then 
the 
Holy 
Spirit 
comes 
out 
of 
the 
blue 
and 
says 
hi 
nice 
to 
meet 
you 
for 
the 
first 
time 
u 
However 
if 
I 
take 
you 
at 
your 
word 
that 
nothing 
happened 
to 
you 
prior 
and 
if 
something 
did 
happen 
prior 
no 
matter 
how 
subconscious 
you 
would 
have 
noticed 
it 
but 
you 
t 
notice 
it 
Then 
that 
could 
explain 
some 
stuff 
u 
Notice 
the 
Spirit 
is 
mentioned 
for 
the 
act 
of 
sealing 
You 
suppose 
that 
s 
the 
only 
work 
Like 
I 
said 
I 
don 
t 
know 
what 
you 
experience 
It 
was 
probably 
something 
alright 
I 
hope 
you 
re 
being 
arrogant 
in 
denying 
that 
God 
opened 
you 
up 
prior 
to 
conversion 
u 
However 
if 
they 
are 
correct 
that 
the 
Father 
t 
single 
them 
out 
the 
spirit 
t 
personally 
regenerate 
them 
to 
respond 
and 
Jesus 
did 
not 
die 
for 
them 
personally 
and 
their 
name 
was 
not 
in 
the 
book 
prior 
to 
some 
experience 
then 
I 
don 
t 
know 
what 
they 
experienced 
u 
I 
m 
not 
sure 
if 
people 
are 
taking 
credit 
for 
things 
they 
t 
take 
credit 
for 
arrogant 
but 
not 
damning 
or 
if 
they 
are 
telling 
the 
truth 
and 
they 
did 
not 
have 
a 
Trinitarian 
conversion 
false 
conversion 
Both 
would 
explain 
their 
reluctance 
to 
acknowledge 
Jesus 
as 
King 
u 
Did 
Jesus 
save 
you 
or 
did 
he 
make 
it 
possible 
for 
you 
to 
choose 
wisely

Some

t 
co 
S 
u 
I 
get 
your 
point 
I 
am 
just 
trying 
to 
avoid 
mixing 
up 
concepts 
I 
would 
probably 
talk 
about 
love 
rather 
than 
grace 
in 
the 
world 
u 
So 
you 
think 
Eden 
was 
in 
the 
dispensation 
of 
Grace 
u 
That 
s 
not 
the 
way 
grace 
is 
generally 
used 
in 
the 
Bible 
I 
don 
t 
think 
that 
s 
even 
how 
talk 
about 
grace 
Grace 
is 
mercy 
Mercy 
is 
needed 
because 
of 
sin 
u 
Eden 
was 
the 
only 
genuine 
covenant 
of 
works 
merit 
Having 
good 
food 
to 
eat 
in 
Eden 
was 
not 
a 
form 
of 
grace 
I 
don 
t 
think 
that 
even 
the 
reformed 
thinkers 
who 
write 
about 
Common 
Grace 
i 
e 
non 
Grace 
would 
call 
the 
good 
fruit 
in 
Eden 
a 
form 
of 
grace 
u 
They 
were 
good 
They 
were 
not 
perfect 
The 
world 
was 
a 
world 
without 
grace 
Grace 
only 
comes 
into 
the 
picture 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
sin 
u 
Reprobation 
is 
usually 
discussed 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
original 
sin 
Is 
it 
asking 
too 
much 
to 
stick 
to 
a 
post 
Genesis 
world 
when 
discussing 
it 
u 
No 
Cain 
was 
reprobate 
Any 
more 
questions 
u 
That 
s 
not 
what 
reformed 
people 
mean 
when 
they 
use 
the 
phrase 
irresistible 
grace 
It 
t 
mean 
that 
you 
do 
not 
initially 
wrestle 
with 
the 
gospel 
It 
means 
that 
God 
overcomes 
your 
resistance 
The 
Reformed 
churches 
don 
t 
confess 
baptismal 
regeneration 
u 
Sure 
u 
Why 
are 
you 
so 
hooked 
on 
that 
Exhale 
God 
is 
in 
charge 
Give 
Him 
the 
glory 
u 
No 
It 
is 
not 
some 
random 
lottery 
You 
have 
never 
heard 
this 
explained 
before 
u 
that 
is 
the 
point 
It 
is 
natural 
It 
is 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Spirit 
making 
the 
invisible 
work 
of 
God 
visible 
in 
you 
like 
a 
light 
to 
the 
world 
u 
That 
is 
an 
outward 
show 
u 
You 
have 
an 
IF 
u 
Sure 
God 
knows 
the 
heart 
He 
knows 
the 
fakers 
Is 
that 
hard 
to 
believe 
u 
I 
did 
not 
say 
that 
It 
is 
Trinitarian 
salvation 
along 
with 
the 
whole 
package 
which 
includes 
sanctification 
u 
So 
if 
Tom 
does 
this 
God 
does 
that 
but 
it 
is 
not 
a 
covenant 
based 
on 
an 
if 
Makes 
total 
sense 
u 
It 
is 
not 
some 
lottery 
like 
there 
is 
some 
unrepentant 
living 
like 
a 
heathen 
who 
dies 
that 
way 
and 
goes 
to 
heaven 
because 
he 
got 
lucky 
God 
saves 
who 
He 
wills

Golden

baby

Make 
up 
your 
mind 
First 
you 
said 
the 
elect 
was 
Israel 
Now 
you 
are 
saying 
it 
is 
anyone 
who 
voting 
for 
yourself 
u 
Building 
the 
church 
is 
incredibly 
important 
though 
The 
church 
is 
not 
just 
some 
social 
club 
u 
Because 
we 
are 
not 
all 
knowing 
We 
do 
not 
know 
who 
the 
elect 
are 
If 
we 
knew 
that 
would 
reinvent 
the 
witnessing 
process

which 
is

co 
u 
u 
Salvation 
is 
not 
some 
human 
thought 
experiment 
It 
is 
a 
divine 
Trinitarian 
act

which 
all

Why

you 
re 
going 
to 
have 
to 
convince 
me 
better 
than 
that 
if 
you 
want 
me 
to 
believe 
your 
revisionist 
fantasy 
that 
you 
re 
calling 
history 
u 
Just 
to 
clarify 
it 
was 
invented 
by 
men 
very 
very 
insane 
men 
who 
were 
rebuked 
by 
other 
insane 
men 
your 
brothers 
who 
think 
your 
system 
is 
insane 
u 
it 
was 
invented 
like 
what 
years 
ago 
u 
Nice 
try 
We 
all 
know 
you 
think 
Peter 
sucks 
u 
That 
s 
a 
good 
place 
to 
start 
It 
is 
important 
to 
keep 
in 
mind 
that 
your 
trust 
is 
based 
on 
the 
assumption 
that 
He 
is 
in 
control 
of 
it 
all 
Your 
praise 
of 
Him 
is 
based 
on 
the 
premise 
that 
He 
reached 
out 
and 
saved 
you 
He 
gets 
the 
glory 
all 
the 
glory 
u 
You 
act 
like 
Mid 
Acts 
dropped 
from 
the 
sky 
u 
we 
are 
talking 
about 
apostates 
Apostates 
have 
no 
blessings 
u 
If 
he 
wanted 
to 
create 
anteaters 
to 
eat 
ants 
he 
would 
have 
oh 
wait 
he 
did 
u 
The 
parable 
of 
the 
sower 
is 
an 
excellent 
example 
When 
you 
combine 
that 
teaching 
with 
other 
teachings 
you 
ll 
realize 
that 
God 
has 
dominion 
over 
the 
environment 
shade 
water 
etc 
and 
protects 
His 
people 
u 
Your 
weird 
idiosyncratic 
perspective 
has 
already 
been 
made 
clear 
She 
was 
talking 
about 
Calvinism 
Try 
to 
keep 
up 
u 
Generally 
speaking 
I 
suppose 
that 
s 
right 
but 
there 
is 
an 
element 
in 
of 
God 
invisibly 
prearranging 
the 
whole 
thing 
even 
though 
we 
might 
have 
the 
impression 
that 
we 
are 
the 
ones 
taking 
the 
lead 
u 
Reformed 
theology 
makes 
a 
distinction 
between 
the 
general 
calling 
and 
the 
special 
calling 
The 
general 
calling 
is 
hearing 
some 
street 
preacher 
but 
having 
the 
message 
roll 
off 
you 
The 
special 
calling 
is 
the 
effectual 
call 
where 
everything 
comes 
together 
and 
you 
respond 
u 
In 
reformed 
thought 
the 
church 
is 
visible 
and 
invisible 
Generally 
speaking 
we 
are 
confined 
to 
dealing 
with 
the 
visible 
church 
which 
contains 
a 
mix 
of 
elect 
and 
people 
and 
we 
don 
t 
know 
who 
is 
who 
The 
falling 
away 
passages 
are 
directed 
to 
the 
visible 
church 
u 
That 
is 
a 
real 
problem 
for 
those 
who 
are 
mere 
pointers 
as 
distinguished 
from 
reformed 
Contrary 
to 
popular 
opinion 
the 
real 
point 
of 
reformed 
thought 
t 
free 
will 
or 
predestination 
It 
s 
covenant 
which 
fully 
explains 
the 
falling 
away 
passages

Lemme

try 
Jesus 
and 
Paul 
had 
different 
messages 
and 
if 
Paul 
said 
the 
same 
thing 
as 
Jesus 
then 
it 
must 
be 
for 
the 
Jews 
maybe 
just 
the 
era 
Jews 
because 
gentiles 
can 
do 
whatever 
they 
want 
so 
the 
verse 
t 
be 
for 
them 
Do 
I 
have 
method 
down 
yet 
u 
There 
must 
have 
been 
some 
Jews 
in 
Ephesus 
Maybe 
we 
have 
to 
rightly 
divide 
that 
verse 
for 
them 
Am 
I 
getting 
this 
whole 
thing 
yet 
I 
started 
watching 
Wolf 
Hall 
mini 
series 
on 
Amazon 
It 
is 
pretty 
good 
for 
a 
dry 
historical 
drama 
u 
I 
have 
not 
done 
either 
They 
are 
both 
great 
ministries 
u 
I 
get 
that 
they 
don 
t 
promote 
that 
but 
they 
have 
no 
justification 
for 
opposing 
it 
What 
are 
they 
going 
to 
do 
Preach 
the 
Cs 
at 
them 
They 
already 
rejected 
them 
They 
got 
nothing 
outside 
of 
Caesar 
who 
becomes 
their 
ultimate 
standard 
because 
they 
reject 
God 
s 
standards 
u 
And 
what 
was 
that 
about 
The 
liberty 
to 
steal 
cars 
The 
liberty 
to 
cheat 
on 
your 
spouse 
The 
liberty 
to 
curse 
God 
You 
are 
abusing 
that 
verse 
u 
Those 
are 
your 
Guru 
s 
ideas 
Ask 
him 
u 
And 
when 
you 
are 
not 
the 
same 
You 
won 
t 
lash 
out 
at 
the 
ideas 
I 
listed 
above 
You 
won 
t 
call 
baptism 
a 
burden 
You 
won 
t 
reject 
repentance 
You 
won 
t 
reject 
good 
works 
too 
burdensome 
This 
is 
how 
an 
unbeliever 
untouched 
by 
the 
Triune 
God 
thinks 
u 
We 
do 
not 
worship 
works 
We 
do 
not 
say 
that 
works 
save 
you 
However 
our 
conception 
of 
Christianity 
is 
deeply 
Trinitarian 
That 
means 
that 
it 
t 
some 
philosophy 
you 
embrace 
and 
get 
a 
ticket 
punched 
It 
leads 
to 
radical 
transformation 
from 
the 
inside 
out 
You 
won 
t 
be 
the 
same 
u 
Of 
course 
not 
When 
you 
read 
the 
scriptures 
in 
the 
spirit 
it 
leads 
you

Wonder 
what

a 
deeply 
deeply 
deeply 
Trinitarian 
conception 
of 
this 
The

is 
written 
on 
our 
hearts 
so 
in 
that 
regard 
we 
are 
not 
under 
the 
law 
We 
walk 
it 
in 
the 
spirit 
We 
don

trample

We 
live 
it 
in 
love 
We

Psalm 
of 
our 
love

You 
re 
lying 
to 
yourself 
if 
you 
don 
t 
realize 
this 
whole 
rightly 
dividing 
catchphrase 
means 
nothing 
other 
than 
consistently 
sniffing 
out 
the 
Jewish 
stuff 
and 
saying 
it 
t 
apply 
to 
you 
u 
No 
you 
haven 
t 
All 
you 
proven 
is 
your 
bias 
towards 
all 
things 
gentile 
and 
a 
knee 
jerk 
reaction 
to 
dissociate 
yourself 
from 
Jesus 
Peter 
James 
Jude 
John 
and 
all 
Hebrews 
u 
I 
understand 
Peter 
was 
not 
an 
honorary 
gentile 
Paul 
was 
an 
honorary 
gentile 
You 
only 
care 
about 
stuff 
written 
to 
gentiles 
Everything 
else 
is 
not 
for 
you 
Peter 
says 
the 
same 
as 
Paul 
you 
it 
Paul 
says 
the 
same 
as 
Peter 
and 
you 
talk 
of 
crisscross 
not 
another 
gospel 
u 
They 
will 
disagree 
with 
my 
phrasing 
but 
I 
m 
tired 
of 
pussyfooting 
around 
what 
is 
going 
on 
here 
When 
they 
say 
rightly 
dividing 
they 
mean 
separating 
the 
Jews 
from 
the 
gentiles 
regardless 
of 
whether 
they 
are 
professing 
Christians 
Look 
everything 
they 
say 
and 
how 
they 
say 
it 
u 
Let 
me 
help 
essentially 
believe 
that 
the 
key 
to 
rightly 
dividing 
is 
found 
in 
the 
realization 
that 
Paul 
is 
an 
honorary 
gentile 
Peter 
never 
became 
an 
honorary 
gentile 
so 
they 
nitpick 
and 
dismiss 
everything 
he 
says 
as 
insufficient 
and 
inferior 
compared 
to 
Paul 
u 
So 
you 
see 
no 
unity 
between 
the 
foreshadow 
and 
the 
object 
creating 
the 
foreshadow 
u 
Ah 
I 
probably 
should 
have 
picked 
an 
example 
from 
something 
I 
seen 
recently 
My 
bad 
My 
point 
is 
one 
of 
hermeneutics 
progressive 
revelation 
and 
unity 
u 
I 
think 
understand 
you 
point 
but 
I 
don 
t 
see 
the 
significance 
It 
s 
like 
thinking 
the 
film 
The 
Sixth 
Sense 
was 
more 
than 
one 
film 
based 
on 
the 
progressive 
revelation 
of 
the 
story 
to 
the 
audience 
u 
I 
empathize 
with 
the 
difficulty 
with 
trying 
to 
get 
these 
ideas 
in 
a 
tweet 
but 
could 
you 
elaborate

the 
Reformed 
faith

For

the 
idea 
of 
making 
a 
huge 
break 
for 
being 
able 
to 
eat 
meat 
after 
the 
flood 
is 
kind 
of 
I 
don 
t 
know 
trivial 
perhaps 
We 
don 
t 
deny 
the 
existence 
of 
change 
but 
we 
do 
not 
want 
that 
to 
overshadow 
the 
unity 
It 
s 
one 
big 
symphony 
Every 
movement 
has 
it 
s 
place 
u 
To 
be 
honest 
compared 
to 
reformed 
people 
t 
generally 
too 
obsessed 
with 
that 
line 
of 
investigation 
There 
was 
a 
covenant 
of 
works 
in 
Eden 
followed 
by 
a 
covenant 
of 
grace 
which 
had 
numerous 
looks 
in 
history 
all 
of 
which 
pointed 
toward 
Christ 
u 
There 
are 
different 
administrations 
This 
is 
agreed 
upon 
We 
see 
these 
administrations 
within 
the 
symphony 
of 
historical 
redemption 
However 
takes 
the 
idea 
of 
administrations 
and 
goes 
overboard 
with 
it 
in 
a 
million 
different 
ways 
u 
Not 
technically 
Lordship 
which 
overlaps 
on 
some 
points 
but 
is 
at 
odds 
with 
reformed 
theology 
in 
other 
points 
but 
I 
reject 
the 
view 
completely 
u 
u 
I 
m 
talking 
about 
Saint 
Paul 
I 
love 
how 
explain 
the 
super 
significance 
of 
the 
name 
change 
from 
Saul 
to 
Paul 
as 
if 
it 
were 
some 
miraculous 
ethnic 
transformation 
into 
a 
gentile 
u 
Even 
asking 
about 
Peter 
probably 
caused 
their 
blood 
pressure 
to 
go 
up 
u 
Paul 
is 
an 
honorary 
gentile 
to 
them 
so 
they 
listen 
to 
him 
but 
everything 
else 
is 
considered 
too 
Jewish 
and 
they 
don 
t 
care 
about 
it 
u 
I 
t 
call 
you 
a 
name 
I 
stated 
your 
position 
u 
They 
ignore 
it 
Peter 
is 
a 
Jew 
and 
they 
t 
down 
with 
that 
u 
That 
s 
fine 
If 
you 
don 
t 
really 
love 
him 
then 
by 
all 
means 
don 
t 
listen 
to 
him 
Just 
dig 
deeper 
u 
That 
s 
what 
being 
given 
over 
feels 
like 
u 
RAPTURE 
FEVER 
WHY 
IS 
PARALYZED 
u 
Sure 
Reject 
the 
signs 
of 
the 
covenant 
Reject 
the 
covenant 
Insist 
that 
nothing 
that 
implies 
responsibilities 
applies 
to 
you 
Deny 
the 
kingdom 
Encourage 
others 
to 
deny 
the 
kingdom 
Then 
see 
what 
happens 
What 
can 
I 
say 
you 
re 
very 
brave 
u 
I 
agree 
False 
teachers 
will 
be 
held 
accountable 
u 
it 
was 
just 
for 
apostles 
now 
Then 
why 
did 
they 
set 
up 
those 
signs 
and 
seals 
of 
the 
New 
Covenant 
everywhere 
they 
went 
Lemme 
guess 
something 
about 
the 
Jews 
Something 
about 
a 
transition 
thing 
in 
which 
no 
text 
ever 
mentions 
u 
Jesus 
said 
to 
them 
You 
do 
not 
know 
what 
you 
are 
asking 
Are 
you 
able 
to 
drink 
the 
cup 
that 
I 
drink 
or 
to 
be 
baptized 
with 
the 
baptism 
with 
which 
I 
am 
baptized 
No 
u 
What 
kind 
of 
person 
t 
want 
to 
get 
baptized 
u 
Getting 
baptized 
is 
a 
burden 
to 
you 
Dude 
you 
have 
got 
to 
have 
the 
laziest 
theology 
I 
ever 
heard 
u 
See 
this 
is 
why 
I 
call 
your 
school 
the 
laziest 
expression 
of 
Christianity 
on 
planet 
earth 
AS 
A 
CHRISTIAN 
YOU 
SHOULD 
BAPTIZED 
DOES 
THAT 
MEAN 
I 
LOSE 
MY 
SALVATION 
IF 
I 
DON 
T 
NO 
WELL 
THEN 
I 
DON 
T 
FEEL 
LIKE 
IT 
I 
GOT 
MY 
TICKET 
PUNCHED 
TIME 
TO 
CHILL 
u 
And 
that 
means 
you 
can 
just 
disregard 
the 
very 
very 
explicit 
commands 
to 
do 
it 
u 
I 
t 
ask 
for 
your 
opinion 
I 
asked 
for 
a 
verse 
I 
can 
show 
you 
explicit 
NT 
commands 
to 
baptize 
but 
where 
is 
your 
evidence 
u 
So 
where 
did 
Paul 
say 
that 
Baptism 
would 
disappear 
u 
I 
agree 
there 
is 
no 
substantial 
difference 
between 
Paul 
s 
message 
and 
Jesus 
message 
I 
t 
disagree 
with 
more 
emphatically 
u 
They 
ignore 
it 
For 
as 
many 
of 
you 
as 
were 
baptized 
into 
Christ 
have 
put 
on 
Christ 
There 
is 
neither 
Jew 
nor 
Greek 
there 
is 
neither 
slave 
nor 
free 
there 
is 
no 
male 
and 
female 
for 
you 
are 
all 
one 
in 
Christ

True 
Christianity 
which 
will 
last 
forever 
comes 
from 
the 
gospel 
words 
of 
Christ 
not 
from 
the 
epistles 
of 
Paul 
The 
writings 
of 
Paul 
have 
been 
a 
danger 
and 
a 
hidden 
rock 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
principal 
defects 
of 
Christian 
theology 
u 
t 
co 
z 
u 
Paul 
Therefore 
let 
it 
be 
known 
to 
you 
that 
this 
salvation 
of 
God 
has 
been 
sent 
to 
the 
Gentiles 
they 
will 
listen 
He 
lived 
there 
two 
whole 
years 
at 
his 
own 
expense 
and 
welcomed 
all 
who 
came 
to 
him 
proclaiming 
the 
kingdom 
of 
God 
Act 
u 
Do 
not 
presume 
to 
say 
to 
yourselves 
We 
have 
Abraham 
as 
our 
father 
for 
I 
tell 
you 
God 
is 
able 
from 
these 
stones 
to 
raise 
up 
children 
for 
Abraham

This 
t 
be 
the 
first 
time 
such 
remaking 
had 
occurred 
Ernest 
did 
the 
same 
with 
Jesus 
He 
claimed 
Jesus 
purged 
himself 
of 
all 
Jewish 
traits 
and 
become 
an 
gentile 
Aryan 
say 
got 
the 
wrong 
guy 
To 
put 
it 
lightly 
it 
s 
all 
super 
weird 
u 
I 
m 
not 
a 
hyper 
and 
from 
my 
perspective 
that 
t 
happened 
yet 
However 
that 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
the 
statement 
you 
are 
replying 
to 
u 
are 
confused 
about 
these 
things 
They 
can 
t 
decide 
if 
Kingdom 
of 
God 
and 
Kingdom 
of 
Heaven 
point 
to 
the 
same 
idea 
They 
can 
t 
decide 
if 
the 
promises 
of 
that 
Kingdom 
were 
transferred 
in 
Matt 
and 
what 
that 
means 
for 
the 
church 
and 
Israel 
It 
s 
a 
mess 
of 
thoughts 
u 
I 
have 
listened 
but 
I 
m 
saying 
that 
it 
t 
make 
sense 
The 
most 
I 
can 
determine 
is 
that 
Paul 
can 
say 
good 
works 
are 
the 
result 
of 
the 
spirit 
but 
that 
s 
just 
because 
have 
made 
him 
an 
honorary 
gentile 
or 
one 
of 
the 
good 
ones 
and 
reject 
all 
other 
Jewish 
writers 
u 
You 
need 
to 
make 
up 
your 
mind 
whether 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
God 
is 
physical 
or 
spiritual 
You 
keep 
going 
back 
and 
forth 
Or 
maybe 
you 
can 
do 
yourself 
a 
favor 
and 
embrace 
the 
reformed 
view 
which 
rightly 
handles 
the 
word 
u 
Are 
you 
sure 
Paul 
wrote 
those 
things 
to 
gentiles 
have 
been 
spending 
a 
lot 
of 
time 
explaining 
to 
me 
that 
gentiles 
can 
just 
call 
on 
the 
name 
of 
the 
Lord 
and 
live 
like 
heathens 
and 
it 
s 
all 
good 
u 
Therefore 
say 
I 
unto 
you 
The 
kingdom 
of 
God 
shall 
be 
taken 
from 
you 
and 
given 
to 
a 
nation 
bringing 
forth 
the 
fruits 
thereof 
Matt 
u 
That 
is 
rich 
u 
you 
just 
ignore 
it 
and 
split 
hairs 
with 
an 
asinine 
distinction 
without 
a 
difference

And 
all

If

Our 
doctrine 
of

Yes 
Paul 
was 
Jewish 
and 
that 
requires 
work 
so 
he 
went 
around 
building 
churches 
We 
just 
need 
faith

so 
I 
am

Like

A 
Frenchman 
u 
Because 
if 
we 
talk 
about 
how 
faith 
t 
be 
a 
coping 
mechanism 
to 
not 
feel 
guilt 
about 
living 
like 
a 
heathen 
then 
we 
would 
start 
sounding 
like 
Jesus 
brother 
James 
and 
that 
s 
not 
for 
the 
church 
or 
so 
I 
m 
told

Maybe 
all 
that 
stuff 
in 
Paul 
about 
doing 
good 
and 
not 
sinning 
t 
for 
the 
church 
Maybe 
there 
are 
different 
dispensations 
within 
Paul 
s 
letters 
that 
we 
need 
to 
rightly 
divide 
i

we

was 
told 
the 
great 
commission

We 
can 
chill 
out

what

we 
want

bad 
about 
it

Are 
you

Paul 
wrote 
this 
The 
version 
of 
Paul 
t 
talk 
about 
fruit 
Fruit 
is 
works 
and 
law 
which 
t 
mix 
with 
grace 
or 
so 
I 
m 
told 
We 
just 
need 
faith 
and 
we 
can 
get 
rid 
of 
the 
guilt 
of 
living 
in 
constant 
unrepentant 
sin

I 
saw 
that

what

gross 
we

all 
by

everyone

in

we 
t 
have

Paul

Did 
you

The 
stuff 
about 
working 
righteousness 
Sound 
familiar 
In 
the 
New

old

IN

You

my 
point

Catholic

added 
stuff 
hundreds 
of 
years 
later 
We 
know 
that 
they 
did 
it 
Some 
of 
it 
is 
understandable 
People 
t 
sure 
what 
were 
notes 
and 
what 
was 
the 
original 
text 
so 
they 
included 
it 
all 
u 
Was 
that 
part 
in 
Acts 
added 
by 
a 
different 
hand 
u 
It 
is 
obviously 
an 
apocryphal 
tale 
story 
added 
by 
the 
hand 
of 
a 
scribe 
who 
really 
liked 
the 
story 
a 
lot 
and 
thought 
it 
would 
improve 
upon 
the 
text 
u 
It 
sounds 
like 
someone 
who 
t 
have 
a 
clue 
about 
Jewish 
law 
making 
up 
a 
story 
with 
all 
the 
details 
of 
Jewish 
law 
completely 
wrong 
Then 
it 
has 
Jesus 
saying 
hey 
everyone 
messes 
up 
so 
let 
s 
not 
punish 
her 
No 
witnesses 
No 
partner 
No 
testimony 
It 
makes 
no 
sense 
u 
We 
have 
earlier 
manuscripts 
that 
lack 
the 
additions 
For 
instance 
the 
woman 
caught 
in 
adultery 
was 
not 
in 
the 
earliest 
manuscripts 
Then 
it 
was 
added 
to 
Luke 
hundreds 
of 
years 
later 
Then 
it 
was 
moved 
to 
John

The 
Proof 
of 
the

an 
excellent 
job 
on 
showing

of

of 
futurists 
were 
already 
fulfilled

Eschatology

their 
main 
concern 
Theology 
existed 
but 
there 
was 
hardly 
an 
effort 
to 
be 
systematic 
about 
it 
On 
one 
hand 
they 
recognize 
that 
the 
destruction 
of 
Jerusalem 
was 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
most 
of 
NT 
prophecy 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
they 
acted 
like 
it 
t 
fulfilled

I 
am

on 
this 
subject

of 
David

He

to

He 
also 
seemed 
to 
buy 
into 
the 
theory 
that 
since 
the 
earth 
was 
created 
in 
six 
days 
it

very 
confused 
eschatology

claim 
him

points

his 
view

to 
change

on 
what 
text 
he 
was 
examining 
u 
was 
an 
odd 
guy 
He 
received 
incorrect 
information 
that 
John 
wrote 
Revelation 
during 
the 
reign 
of 
Domitian 
rather 
than 
the 
reign 
of 
Nero 
and 
this 
led 
him 
to 
a 
wildly 
confused 
interpretation 
based 
off 
that 
misinformation

some

even

I 
looked 
into

I 
would 
find 
nothing 
to 
substantiate 
your 
claims

Also 
I 
did 
not 
say 
they 
did 
not 
talk 
of 
eschatology 
I 
said 
they 
did 
not 
have 
rapture 
mania

you 
have 
given 
me 
two 
fake

I 
might 
take 
a 
look 
when 
I 
have 
the 
time 
u 
Also 
it 
is 
not 
a 
quote 
and 
it 
is 
incredibly 
dishonest 
There 
is 
no 
mention 
of 
Rome 
and 
someone 
inserted 
it 
to 
make 
it 
seem 
like 
it 
was 
talking 
about 
temple 
when 
it 
was 
talking 
about 
temple 
u 
Look 
at 
it 
closer 
It 
is 
about 
the 
destruction 
of 
temple 
rebuilding 
temple 
and 
that 
one 
was 
destroyed 
and 
now 
the 
temple 
is 
spiritual 
u 
I 
am 
looking 
at 
it 
right 
now

passage

believe 
he 
was

by 
the

spirit

the

writers

the 
spirit

Same 
with

I 
agree

atheists 
are 
in 
the 
same 
camp 
pushing 
the 
narrative 
that 
Paul 
and 
Jesus 
had 
wildly 
distinct 
messages 
u 
I 
disagree 
with 
these 
God

The

did 
not 
lead 
them

conclusions 
Something

did

strange 
bedfellows

bedfellows

This 
is 
what 
the

The

are 
basically 
saying 
that 
the

Spirit 
inspired 
them 
to 
be 
wrong 
or 
the 
Holy 
Spirit 
t 
know 
the 
future 
or 
was 
filling 
them 
with 
false 
hope 
Either 
way 
you 
got 
problems 
u 
It 
s 
not 
exactly 
the 
same 
The 
secular 
academics 
hate 
Paul 
and 
they 
think 
that 
driving 
a 
wedge 
between 
Paul 
and 
Jesus 
the 
other 
apostles 
will 
further 
their 
anti 
Christian 
agenda 
agree 
with 
their 
premise 
but 
say 
who 
cares 
u 
I 
do 
believe 
it 
is 
alive 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
it 
is 
fighting 
itself 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
the 
Holy 
Spirit 
was 
simultaneously 
giving 
one 
gospel 
to 
John 
and 
a 
totally 
different 
gospel 
to 
Paul 
in 
the 
same 
exact 
year 
Please 
let 
that 
sink 
in 
u 
Here 
s 
my 
point 
you 
have 
all 
of 
Christendom 
on 
one 
side 
and 
on 
the 
other 
side 
you 
have 
and 
non 
Christian 
academics 
saying 
that 
the 
Christians 
who 
see 
harmony 
are 
wrong 
u 
generally 
fall 
into 
two 
camps 
with 
some 
overlap 
and 
u 
Wow 
who 
do 
you 
think 
runs 
the 
religion 
departments 
at 
major 
universities 
u 
So 
you 
don 
t 
find 
it 
odd 
that 
atheist 
scholars 
who 
are 
intent 
on 
destroying 
the 
harmony 
in 
scripture 
by 
overemphasizing 
supposed 
differences 
and 
who 
are 
intent 
on 
rightly 
dividing 
by 
overemphasizing 
supposed 
differences 
often 
end 
on 
the 
same 
note 
u 
And 
what 
is 
so 
ironic 
is 
that 
emerged 
as 
a 
hostile 
reaction 
to 
this 
form 
of 
secular 
intellectualism 
invading 
the 
mainline 
churches 
but 
instead 
of 
challenging 
it 
they 
ran 
away 
and 
the 
accidentally 
declared 
it 
holy

With 
all 
due 
respect 
you 
boast 
that 
you 
do 
not 
read 
scholarship 
How 
would 
you 
even 
know 
what 
the 
unbelievers 
are 
saying 
What 
I 
said 
was 
factual 
One 
of 
the 
goals 
of 
unbelieving 
scholars 
is 
to 
point 
out 
the 
tension 
between 
the 
texts 
to 
show 
disharmony 
among 
NT 
writers 
u 
according 
to 
my 
gospel

THE 
PREACHING 
OF 
JESUS 
CHRIST 
According 
Mid 
Acts

well 
as 
all 
the

in 
opposition 
to 
each 
other

cannot 
be 
harmonized

they 
do

you

But 
why

They 
would

Jews 
writing

is 
not 
the 
most 
effective 
strategy 
u 
Yep 
The 
entire

circulating 
in 
a 
way 
that 
complicates 
your 
premise

Sometimes

does 
Sometimes 
he 
assumes

already 
know 
You 
give 
him 
the 
benefit 
of 
the 
doubt

In

Paul 
does 
not 
mention 
it 
in

mania

a 
more 
recent 
evangelical 
pop 
thing 
for 
the 
most 
part 
It 
has 
been 
a 
good 
recruiting 
tool 
for 
though 
u 
u 
the 
the 
early 
Reformers 
had 
an 
optimistic 
eschatology 
of

over

Thank 
you 
for 
sharing 
u 
you 
are 
surprised 
by 
Rome 
not 
having 
some 
bizarre 
sci 
view 
u 
A 
millennium 
separated 
from 
Christ 
while 
he 
s 
down 
on 
earth 
right 
u 
The 
prophet 
John 
the 
Baptist 
said 
And 
do 
not 
think 
you 
can 
say 
to 
yourselves 
We 
have 
Abraham 
as 
our 
father 
I 
tell 
you 
that 
out 
of 
these 
stones 
God 
can 
raise 
up 
children 
for 
Abraham 
could 
accuse 
him 
of 
replacement 
theology 
u 
At 
the 
same 
time 
heaven 
is 
not 
our 
home 
We 
will 
just 
be 
passing 
through 
in 
a 
disembodied 
state 
The 
real 
hope 
is 
the 
resurrection 
of 
our 
transformed 
physical 
earthly 
bodies 
Living 
in 
the 
fully 
realized 
on 
a 
transformed 
earth

I 
am 
not 
trying 
to 
sound 
cute 
This 
is 
a 
legit 
question 
that 
is 
apparent 
to 
everyone 
who 
t 
deny 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
God 
here 
and 
now 
The 
Kingdom 
is 
about 
bringing 
the 
heaven 
and 
earth 
together 
through 
the 
power 
of

Okay 
when 
you 
reconcile 
the 
lost 
to 
God 
e 
g 
a 
drug 
pusher 
through 
the 
Gospel 
does 
not 
the 
earth 
in 
some 
way 
become 
more 
heavenly 
u 
What 
I 
m 
saying 
is 
the 
body 
of 
Christ 
is 
a 
nation 
or 
people 
in 
a 
non 
traditional 
sense 
We 
are 
all 
tongues 
tribes 
and 
nations 
Our 
land 
inheritance 
t 
confined 
to 
a 
plot 
of 
land 
It 
is 
the 
whole 
earth 
and 
we 
conquer 
it 
not 
with 
the 
sword 
but 
with 
the 
word 
u 
Once 
you 
were 
not 
a 
people 
but 
now 
you 
are 
God

people 
once 
you 
had 
not

now 
you

We 
don 
t 
reject 
Paul 
We 
reject 
what 
you 
attempted 
to 
turn 
Paul 
into

He 
does 
have 
a 
label 
He 
s 
a 
mid 
Acts 
guy 
He 
sounds 
exactly 
like 
all 
the 
other 
mid

He 
has 
the

doctrine 
as 
all

What

you

Can 
you

Private

Do 
you

what 
I 
m 
talking 
about 
has 
been 
around 
long 
long 
long 
before 
was

No 
Christian 
of 
any 
stripe 
thought 
a 
third 
temple 
would 
be 
built 
The 
prophecy 
was 
fulfilled 
Jesus 
nailed

t 
co 
u 
I 
m 
not 
offended 
but 
I 
am 
wondering 
if 
you 
re 
using 
humor 
as 
a 
defense 
mechanism 
because 
would 
rather 
make 
everyone 
in 
the 
NT 
a 
forgivable 
false 
prophet 
to 
keep 
their 
eschatology 
charts 
Prophecy 
obsession 
is 
what 
brought 
them 
in 
the 
first 
place 
u 
It 
s 
a 
parable 
I 
do 
not 
take 
parables 
as 
a 
newspaper 
story 
Nobody 
should 
Does 
the 
scripture 
teach 
hell 
Yes 
u 
Just 
to 
clarify 
Allegory 
is 
not 
always 
wrong 
Paul 
used 
it 
I 
tend 
to 
avoid 
it 
I 
do 
not 
interpret 
Revelation 
as 
allegory 
It 
is 
a 
different 
type 
of 
literature 
that 
requires 
a 
different 
approach 
than 
say 
the 
book 
of 
Ruth 
u 
Did 
I 
touch 
a 
nerve 
Not 
a 
literal 
nerve 
That 
s 
an 
expression 
I 
want 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
you 
understand 
that 
I 
did 
not 
plan 
to 
open 
you 
up 
and 
do 
surgery 
on 
you 
and 
touch 
a 
literal 
nerve 
u 
How 
many 
steps 
away 
is 
from 
s 
syndrome 
Because 
you 
guys 
have 
a 
hard 
time 
grasping 
figures 
of 
speeches 
and 
symbolism 
and 
other 
literary 
devices 
u 
So 
you 
think 
the 
prophetic 
idiom 
of 
symbolism 
is 
ludicrous 
u 
I 
did 
not 
say 
it 
was 
allegory 
Pilgrim 
s 
Progress 
is 
allegory 
Revelation 
is 
closer 
to 
a 
Salvador 
Dali 
painting 
than 
a 
newspaper 
story 
It 
s 
symbolic 
representation 
u 
Do 
I 
need 
to 
slow 
down 
for 
you 
u 
Why 
does 
John 
have 
to 
ask 
the 
angel 
to 
explain 
the 
symbols 
u 
t 
co 
u 
It 
was 
written 
during 
Nero 
s 
persecution 
I 
John 
your 
brother 
and 
partner 
in 
the 
tribulation 
and 
the 
kingdom 
and 
the 
patient 
endurance 
that 
are 
in 
Jesus 
It 
was 
to 
give 
hope 
to 
others 
being 
oppressed 
by 
Nero 
the 
beast 
u 
John 
t 
go 
into 
a 
time 
machine 
It 
was 
a 
vision 
filled 
with 
symbols 
forms 
of 
representation 
and 
metaphorical 
imagery 
It 
is 
not 
in 
the 
same 
universe 
as 
the 
story 
of 
Joseph 
and 
his 
brothers 
so 
stop 
reading 
it 
like 
it 
is 
u 
Revelation 
is 
another 
witness 
to 
that 
prophecy 
albeit 
in 
a 
different 
genre 
Revelation 
was 
written 
in 
the 
s 
u 
There 
s 
nothing 
wrong 
with 
allegory 
Paul 
used 
it 
Galatians 
As 
for 
Revelation 
the 
book 
literally 
says 
to 
not 
take 
it 
literally 
but 
you 
can 
t 
seem 
to 
follow 
that 
simple 
instruction 
u 
Peter 
said 
be 
patient 
All 
those 
scoffers 
were 
either 
slaughtered 
or 
enslaved 
a 
few 
years 
later 
u 
You 
re 
reading 
it 
wrong 
You 
re 
thinking 
about 
it 
wrong 
You 
re 
interpreting 
it 
wrong 
u 
There 
was 
no 
pause 
in 
the 
prophetic 
clock 
This 
generation 
means 
Jesus 
generation 
Soon 
means 
soon 
Near 
means 
near 
All 
of 
that 
stuff 
happened 
without 
a 
question 
u 
No 
kidding 
What 
I 
just 
quoted 
from 
Luke 
is 
what 
already 
literally 
verifiable 
without 
a 
doubt 
already 
happened 
u 
Yep 
That 
s 
about 
the 
Great 
Tribulation 
Please 
let 
that 
sink 
in 
u 
Yep 
Then 
let 
those 
who 
are 
in 
Judea 
flee 
to 
the 
mountains 
and 
let 
those 
who 
are 
inside 
the 
city 
depart 
and 
let 
not 
those 
who 
are 
out 
in 
the 
country 
enter 
it 
for 
these 
are 
days 
of 
vengeance 
to 
fulfill 
all 
that 
is 
written 
Luke 
u 
It 
t 
Jesus 
put 
an 
end 
to 
blood 
sacrifice 
At 
this 
point 
to 
engage 
in 
animal 
sacrifice 
is 
essentially 
to 
say 
that 
Jesus 
blood 
was 
not 
enough 
u 
Just 
talking 
mathematics 
u 
Take 
the 
word 
count 
of 
Matthew 
s 
Gospel 
and 
add 
it 
to 
the 
word 
count 
of 
Luke 
s 
Gospel 
and 
that 
number 
is 
bigger 
than 
all 
the 
words 
written 
by 
Paul

t 
co 
N 
TH 
u 
I 
watched 
it 
alright 
and 
wow 
that 
s 
blasphemous 
u 
how 
do 
you 
guys 
accuse 
reformed 
people 
of 
limiting 
the 
atonement 
Look 
what 
you 
just 
did 
u 
WOW 
you 
don 
t

You

not

off 
Many 
believe 
in 
the 
millennial 
renewal 
of

sacrifices 
Our 
friends 
at 
have 
released 
a 
new 
biography 
of 
by 
the 
s 
Danny 
Check 
it 
out 
u 
He 
cut 
a 
covenant 
with 
many 
and 
was 
cut 
off 
then 
the 
city 
and 
temple 
were 
destroyed 
Jesus 
said 
he 
was 
the 
messiah 
started 
the 
NC 
said 
he 
would 
be 
cut 
off 
and 
it 
would 
result 
in 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
city 
and 
temple 
u 
Christ 
no 
question 
u 
I 
think 
it 
disturbing 
that 
so 
many 
see 
this 
clearly 
messianic 
passage 
as 
being 
about 
the 
u 
u 
I 
prefer 
the 
more 
accurate 
term 
and 
translation 
u 
Daniel 
says 
the 
messiah 
would 
cut 
a 
new 
covenant 
with 
many 
and 
then 
be 
cut 
off 
That 
is 
what 
happened 
u 
it 
is 
the 
same 
word 
The 
British 
King 
Government 
Issued 
version 
dropped 
the 
ball 
big 
time 
u 
What 
do 
you 
think 
testament 
means 
u 
Yes 
the 
total 
victory 
of 
Christ 
u 
Luke 
literally 
says 
the 
new 
covenant 
in 
my 
blood 
u 
Last 
supper 
u 
Without 
a 
covenant 
you 
have 
no 
hope 
and 
are 
without 
God 
That 
s 
why 
the 
New 
Covenant 
was 
instituted 
u 
if 
you 
agree 
with 
my 
statement 
you 
are 
treading 
into 
theology 
u 
Did 
I 
say 
that 
we 
were 
under 
an 
Israeli 
covenant 
No 
the 
New 
Covenant 
is 
worldwide 
That 
s 
why 
Paul 
went 
around 
establishing 
churches 
and 
praised 
God 
for 
He 
has 
made 
us 
competent 
as 
ministers 
of 
a 
new 
covenant

Everything

You 
need 
to 
understand 
this 
u 
You 
re 
talking 
like 
a 
Trinitarian 
now 
I 
agree 
completely 
At 
the 
same 
time 
shepherds 
parents 
and 
teachers 
have 
a 
responsibility 
to 
not 
promote 
anarchy 
by 
saying 
Christianity 
t 
have 
any 
do 
s 
and 
don 
ts 
u 
Paul 
is 
crystal 
clear 
about 
the 
church 
being 
married 
to 
Christ 
FYI 
marriage 
is 
not 
a 
mental 
ascent 
It 
s 
a 
relationship 
just 
like 
our 
relationship 
with 
Christ 
u 
I 
know 
the 
grace 
part 
is 
there 
My 
whole 
critique 
is 
that 
you 
guys 
are 
unbalanced 
You 
can 
t 
even 
tell 
people 
not 
to 
be 
a 
without 
imposing 
a 
don 
t 
u 
There 
s 
a 
hierarchy 
of 
authority 
between 
the 
bride 
and 
the 
bridegroom 
u 
Denying 
ungodliness 
and 
worldly 
lusts 
is 
general 
form 
of 
don 
t 
and 
SHOULD 
live 
soberly 
righteously 
and 
godly 
is 
a 
general 
form 
of 
do 
s 
u 
Here 
s 
one 
things 
that 
bugs 
me 
about 
Paul 
says 
something 
as 
simple 
as 
you 
don 
t 
have 
to 
keep 
the 
clean 
unclean 
distinction 
and 
you 
run 
with 
it 
into 
PAUL 
SAYS 
NO 
RULES 
u 
The 
analogy 
is 
the 
bride 
u 
you 
think 
Christianity 
does 
not 
have 
and 
shall 
not 
u 
Calvinism 
is 
basically 
another 
name 
for 
Reformed 
Theology 
It 
is 
a 
theology 
not 
a 
religion 
Christianity 
is 
defined 
as 
a 
religion 
and 
you 
define 
yourself 
as 
outside 
of 
religion 
Therefore 
you 
should 
stop 
associating 
yourself 
with 
Christianity 
u 
That 
makes 
Ephesians 
completely 
meaningless 
Now 
as 
the 
church 
F 
submits 
to 
Christ 
M 
so 
also 
wives 
F 
should 
submit 
in 
everything 
to 
their 
husbands 
M 
Husbands 
M 
love 
your 
wives 
F 
as 
Christ 
M 
loved 
the 
church 
F 
and 
gave 
himself 
up 
for 
HER 
u 
Have 
you 
ever 
read 
poetry 
Do 
you 
understand 
how 
figures 
work 
This 
hyper 
literalism 
is 
so 
destructive 
u 
What 
Mark 
said 
u 
t 
think 
the 
Church 
is 
the 
bride 
Also 
according 
to 
when 
Jesus 
said 
that 
he 
was 
laying 
down 
his 
life 
for 
his 
sheep 
it 
t 
be 
for 
you 
because 
sheep 
Jews 
We 
have 
to 
rely 
on 
the 
new 
religion 
Paul 
created 
which 
is 
completely 
distinct 
from 
Jesus 
This 
sound 
cool 
u 
As 
we 
now 
know 
it 
Why 
does 
progressive 
revelation 
cause 
so 
much 
stumbling 
u 
Well 
you 
got 
some 
problems 
Paul 
t 
operating 
under 
your 
methodology 
at 
all 
If 
he 
were 
then 
he 
t 
talk 
of 
sheep 
but 
he 
does 
He 
t 
quote 
Jesus 
prophecy 
that 
you 
say 
is 
for 
Jew 
to 
non 
Jews 
but

Now 
you 
re 
all 
jumbled 
up 
u 
St 
Paul 
I 
know 
that 
after 
my 
departure 
fierce 
wolves 
will 
come 
in 
among 
you 
not 
sparing 
the 
flock 
Flock 
sheep 
Paul 
was 
back 
to 
quoting 
Jesus 
who 
said 
Beware 
of 
false 
prophets 
who 
come 
to 
you 
in 
sheep 
s 
clothing 
but 
inwardly 
are 
ravenous 
wolves 
u 
Shepherds 
do 
what 
u 
u 
Very 
very 
interesting 
Maybe 
he 
was 
not 
dead 
yet 
u 
I 
assume 
that 
some 
cities 
will 
have 
to 
be 
rebuilt 
or 
renamed 
for 
the 
seven 
letters 
to 
be 
futuristic 
Can 
you 
imagine 
Turkey 
going 
for 
that 
idea 
This 
is 
silliness 
u 
It 
is 
hilarious 
that 
those 
churches 
will 
be 
established 
in 
some 
sci 
time 
in 
the 
exact 
same 
spot 
where 
first 
century 
churches 
were 
Almost 
makes 
you 
think 
it 
is 
a 
first 
century 
document 
for 
for 
first 
century 
people 
u 
Tradition 
holds 
the 
apostles 
went 
all 
over 
Rome 
Egypt 
India 
Syria 
etc 
etc 
u 
Kingdom 
of 
heaven 
is 
Matthew 
s 
wording 
for 
the 
kingdom 
of 
God 
u 
John 
was 
an 
officer 
at 
Ephesus 
according 
to 
tradition 
u 
Are 
you 
for 
real 
That 
is 
a 
wildly 
inaccurate 
statement 
u 
Wow 
Get 
a 
parallel 
gospel 
It 
is 
the 
same 
thing 
u 
Make 
up 
your 
mind 
Is 
Paul 
going 
to 
the 
temple 
okay 
but 
Peter 
doing 
it 
is 
a 
different 
gospel 
or 
what 
u 
Paul 
went 
to 
the 
temple 
Big 
hypocrite 
or 
biggest 
hypocrite 
u 
Then 
the 
Spirit 
came 
and 
they 
understood 
the 
non 
zealot 
understanding 
of 
the 
Kingdom 
u 
Wow 
it 
almost 
seems 
like 
it 
is 
a 
philosophy 
that 
has 
to 
destroy 
scripture 
to 
prop 
itself 
up 
u 
First 
to 
the 
Jews 
then 
slam 
on 
the 
breaks 
and 
readjust 
your 
mind 
for 
something 
totally 
distinct 
and 
then 
to 
the 
gentiles 
u 
Yeah 
Christianity 
is 
greater 
than 
intellectual 
ascent 
yet 
you 
freak 
out 
over 
having 
to 
get 
off 
the 
sofa 
and 
do 
anything 
u 
Paul 
did 
not 
redefine 
the 
phrase 
You 
just 
do 
not 
understand 
it 
u 
What 
was 
Paul 
teaching 
The 
thoughts 
of 
Plato 
u 
He 
gave 
us 
the 
world 
u 
That 
is 
the 
Great 
Commission 
u 
Read 
Acts 
For 
two 
whole 
years 
Paul 
stayed 
there 
ROME 
in 
his 
own 
rented 
house 
and 
welcomed 
all 
who 
came 
to 
see 
him 
He 
proclaimed 
the 
kingdom 
of 
God 
and 
taught 
about 
the 
Lord 
Jesus 
Christ 
with 
all 
boldness 
and 
without 
hindrance 
u 
Go 
out 
and 
convert 
the 
nations 
is 
the 
Great 
Commission 
That 
s 
what 
Paul 
did 
until 
the 
day 
they 
cut 
off 
his 
head 
u 
You 
interpret 
the 
kingdom 
like 
the 
Jewish 
zealots 
Please 
give 
this 
some 
more 
thought 
u 
I 
already 
showed 
you 
that 
Saint 
Peter 
taught 
the 
same 
thing 
You 
just 
ignore 
it 
though 
u 
People 
of 
all 
walks 
loved 
the 
Temple 
There 
were 
some 
forced 
conversions 
to 
Judaism 
The 
Pharisees 
also 
did 
mission 
work 
The 
were 
basically 
practicing 
Judaism 
King 
Herod 
was 
not 
the 
only 
practicing 
Jew 
of 
Arab 
descent 
It 
was 
a 
popular 
religion 
u 
Paul 
was 
doing 
the 
Great 
Commission 
u 
Also 
I 
will 
again 
point 
out 
something 
you 
continue 
to 
ignore 
Paul 
preached 
the 
Kingdom 
to 
everyone 
u 
Are 
you 
forgetting 
about 
the 
post 
resurrection 
ministry 
where 
Jesus 
explained 
all 
the 
stuff 
they 
missed 
and 
what 
they 
continued 
to 
miss 
was 
further 
illuminated 
by 
the 
HS 
u 
Who 
did 
the 
other 
apostles 
hear 
it 
from 
An 
evil 
spirit 
pretending 
to 
be 
Jesus 
u 
It 
would 
boggle 
the 
mind 
if 
they 
t 
and 
that 
s 
why 
the 
early 
church 
baptized 
infants 
Plus 
they 
understood 
typology 
and 
symbolism 
a 
million 
times 
more 
than 
modern 
man 
Modern 
man 
sees 
symbols 
as 
inferior 
or 
meaningless 
but 
that 
s 
our 
problem 
to 
grapple 
with 
u 
Do 
you 
have 
any 
idea 
how 
big 
the 
average 
family 
of 
that 
time 
was 
They 
were 
having 
a 
kid 
about 
every 
two 
or 
three 
years 
Every 
household 
had 
a 
baby 
in 
it 
u 
I 
gave 
you 
the 
evidence 
of 
the 
household 
baptisms 
which 
is 
the 
basis 
for 
the 
practice 
as 
is 
seen 
in 
the 
earliest 
church 
records 
There 
is 
zero 
historical 
evidence 
that 
credo 
baptism 
was 
practiced 
on 
the 
children 
of 
believers 
at 
any 
point 
in 
the 
first 
years 
of 
Christianity 
u 
Agreed 
but 
the 
head 
of 
the 
household 
can 
be 
held 
accountable 
for 
being 
a 
delinquent 
spiritual 
head 
u 
Baptism 
t 
salvation 
u 
If 
you 
re 
not 
talking 
about 
Baptism 
or 
the 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
what 
are 
you 
calling 
the 
sacramental 
system 
u 
Yep 
circumcision 
t 
save 
either 
u 
Unfortunately 
I 
am 
not 
in 
a 
good 
place 
to 
get 
my 
massive 
edition 
of 
Institutes 
and 
give 
it 
a 
good 
looking 
over 
but 
if 
I 
wanted 
to 
understand 
what 
Calvin 
thought 
about 
Baptism 
I 
would 
go 
to 
his 
section 
about 
Baptism 
not 
the 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
u 
Yes 
Disciples 
were 
not 
just 
kicking 
in 
households 
and 
baptizing 
everyone 
The 
head 
of 
the 
house 
converts 
and 
says 
my 
whole 
house 
is 
going 
to 
be 
Christian 
now 
Let 
s 
get 
baptized 
u 
Maybe 
you 
re 
right 
and 
God 
performed 
a 
miracle 
by 
making 
sure 
that 
there 
were 
no 
babies 
in 
any 
of 
the 
innumerable 
households 
where 
everyone 
in 
the 
household 
was 
baptized 
on 
a 
single 
day 
u 
What 
I 
just 
posted 
was 
from 
the 
Institutes 
Infant 
Baptism 
is 
as 
old 
as 
Christianity 
itself 
so 
it 
has 
that 
going 
for 
it 
Jesus 
instituted 
the 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
so 
your 
attempt 
to 
make 
it 
Roman 
is 
absurd 
u 
You 
have 
some 
bad 
info 
Calvin 
did 
not 
believe 
in 
baptismal 
regeneration 
He 
was 
quite 
clear 
about 
it 
that 
assurance 
of 
salvation 
does 
not 
depend 
on 
participation 
in 
the 
sacraments 
as 
if 
justification 
existed 
in 
it 
u 
He 
went 
to 
his 
death 
screaming 
that 
Jesus 
was 
not 
Lord 
and 
Savior 
and 
anyone 
who 
thought 
that 
was 
idiotic 
u 
He 
reject 
the 
Trinity 
and 
called 
all 
Trinitarians 
blasphemers 
He 
was 
corrected 
countless 
times 
He 
was 
informed 
that 
they 
did 
not 
welcome 
heretics 
like 
him 
and 
they 
had 
laws 
against 
his 
type 
He 
thought 
he 
was 
special 
u 
What 
s 
your 
opinion 
Josh 
Where 
s 
your 
boy 
Michael 
now 
u 
You 
gonna 
cry 
a 
river 
over 
a 
heretic 
like 
Michael 
Where 
do 
you 
think 
he 
is 
right 
now 
I 
don 
t 
I 
don 
t 
even 
possess 
the 
tech 
to 
do 
it 
I 
appreciate 
the 
offer 
though 
u 
Or 
course 
he 
thought 
it 
was 
coming 
soon 
He 
was 
in 
that 
generation 
but 
it 
t 
people 
getting 
beamed 
out 
into 
outer 
space 
and 
the 
sun 
dying 
and 
the 
stars 
from 
outside 
our 
solar 
system 
crashing 
into 
earth 
It 
was 
the 
end 
of 
the 
order 
as 
they 
knew 
it 
u 
They 
sold 
everything 
in 
the 
city 
because 
the 
Messiah 
cut 
a 
New 
Covenant 
with 
many 
got 
cut 
off 
and 
God 
was 
going 
to 
destroy 
everything 
there 
They 
t 
wishing 
upon 
a 
star 
That 
s 
what 
happened 
u 
You 
don 
t 
think 
Peter 
ever 
read 
Daniel 
since 
Pentecost 
The 
Messiah 
cuts 
a 
New 
Covenant 
with 
many 
The 
rest 
get 
the 
Messiah 
cut 
off 
Israel 
gets 
destroyed 
Peter 
was 
there 
when 
Christ 
called 
the 
Kingdom 
a 
mustard 
seed 
not 
a 
special 
effect 
event 
u 
Why 
are 
you 
acting 
like 
this 
was 
some 
big 
question 
mark 
as 
if 
events 
could 
have 
gone 
any 
other 
way 
Every 
informed 
believer 
knew 
the 
city 
and 
temple 
was 
going 
to 
be 
destroyed 
It 
was 
just 
a 
question 
of 
when 
in 
that 
generation 
it 
would 
occur 
u 
Make 
up 
your 
mind 
either 
they 
are 
a 
different 
species 
or 
they 
are 
not 
I 
made 
my 
position 
clear 
but 
you 
re 
all 
over 
the 
place 
u 
I 
agree 
that 
they 
t 
a 
different 
species 
but 
I 
d 
like 
you 
to 
start 
reading 
the 
New 
Testament 
like 
you 
actually 
believe 
that 
This 
whole 
mentality 
of 
Peter 
wrote 
to 
Jews 
so 
I 
can 
dismiss 
it 
because 
they 
are 
a 
different 
species 
than 
me 
is 
a 
broken 
disturbing 
approach 
u 
And 
if 
Peter 
was 
teaching 
a 
message 
at 
odds 
with 
Paul 
s 
then 
Peter 
would 
not 
have 
mentioned 
Paul 
being 
another 
resource 
for 
what 
Peter 
was 
explaining 
They 
are 
on 
the 
same 
page 
but 
your 
system 
has 
blinded 
you 
u 
Peter 
did 
not 
write 
a 
systematic 
theology 
All 
the 
pieces 
are 
there 
but 
your 
system 
has 
blinded 
you 
to 
them 
because 
you 
want 
to 
treat 
Jews 
as 
some 
other 
species 
It 
s 
weird 
at 
best 
u 
How 
does 
this 
happen 
Peter 
knowing 
that 
you 
were 
ransomed 
from 
the 
futile 
ways 
inherited 
from 
your 
forefathers 
not 
with 
perishable 
things 
such 
as 
silver 
or 
gold 
but 
with 
the 
precious 
blood 
of 
Christ 
like 
that 
of 
a 
lamb 
without 
blemish 
or 
spot 
u 
Peter 
why 
are 
you 
putting 
God 
to 
the 
test 
by 
placing 
a 
yoke 
on 
the 
neck 
of 
the 
disciples 
that 
neither 
our 
fathers 
nor 
we 
have 
been 
able 
to 
bear 
But 
we 
believe 
that 
we 
will 
be 
saved 
through 
the 
grace 
of 
the 
Lord 
Jesus 
just 
as 
they 
will 
u 
Peter 
stood 
up 
and 
said 
to 
them 
we 
believe 
that 
we 
will 
be

through 
the 
grace

Wooden

results 
The

u 
I

a 
theory 
mid

an 
attempt 
to 
correct 
the 
theological 
errors 
caused 
by 
wooden 
literalism 
by 
chopping

If 
the

So 
you 
do 
not 
plan

about

that

No

Baptism 
is 
a 
sign 
of 
the 
New

Yes 
there 
is 
such 
a 
thing 
as 
the 
New 
Covenant 
and 
your 
church 
participates 
in 
the 
signs 
of 
the 
New

because 
God 
did 
not 
stop 
mysteriously 
get 
rid

u 
Saint

did 
baptize

t 
Saint 
Paul 
know 
how 
to 
rightly 
divide 
the 
word

a

mid 
Acts 
u 
If 
someone 
went 
into 
Paul

announced 
I 
have

all 
this 
Christian

would

games

that

I 
would

The

was 
not

It 
was

u 
Yes 
and 
instructed 
them 
to 
take 
the 
supper 
with 
the 
utmost 
seriousness 
and 
never 
said 
it 
would 
go 
away 
after 
the 
temple 
was 
destroyed 
u 
If 
it 
was 
for 
a 
different 
gospel 
Paul 
would 
have 
shut 
it 
down 
quick 
not 
teach 
them 
how 
to 
properly 
do 
it 
u 
Jesus 
established 
the 
NC 
and 
Paul 
made 
sure 
the 
gentiles 
did 
it 
but 
that 
is 
neither 
here 
nor 
there 
to 
the 
u 
One 
does 
wonder 
u 
Paul 
never 
said 
anything 
about 
a 
parenthesis 
He 
spoke 
of 
fulfillment 
He 
also 
spoke 
of 
covenant 
u 
Seriously 
where 
does 
scripture 
say 
the 
New 
Covenant 
was 
postponed 
It 
does 
not 
even 
insinuate 
such 
a 
weird 
idea 
u 
So 
secret 
that 
only 
people 
brainwashed 
into 
theology 
see 
it 
u 
Not 
only 
is 
that 
absurd 
but 
there 
is 
no 
precedent 
for 
communion 
with 
God 
without 
covenant 
It 
strains 
credulity 
as 
much 
as 
it 
contradicts 
scripture 
u 
all 
the 
writers 
of 
the 
NT 
which 
is 
really 
the 
same 
as 
the 
NC 
wrote 
about 
the 
NC 
but 
it 
is 
completely 
pointless 
until 
thousands 
or 
millions 
of 
years 
into 
the 
future 
Does 
that 
make 
sense 
to 
anyone 
u 
Abraham 
had 
a 
revelation 
of 
future 
fulfillment 
Paul 
had 
a 
revelation 
of 
fulfillment 
We 
t 
talking 
about 
apples 
and 
oranges 
u 
So 
you 
reject 
the 
resurrection 
u 
the 
Scripture 
foreseeing 
that 
God 
would 
justify 
the 
Gentiles 
by 
faith 
preached 
the 
gospel 
to 
Abraham 
beforehand 
saying 
In 
you 
all 
the 
nations 
shall 
be 
blessed 
Galatians 
u 
You 
don 
t 
believe 
in 
baptism 
or 
the 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
Those 
are 
signs 
of 
the 
New 
Covenant 
u 
That 
s 
what 
you 
believe 
but 
you 
are 
wrong 
u 
Adam 
was 
typologically 
Israel 
They 
let 
unbelieving 
women 
mess 
with 
their 
heads 
to 
the 
point 
where 
they 
rationalized 
sin 
and 
they 
were 
kicked 
out 
of 
the 
land 
u 
This 
was 
a 
prophecy 
going 
back 
to 
Abraham 
u 
Christ 
is 
the 
new 
Adam 
He 
is 
the 
new 
Israel 
We 
are 
Israel 
through 
Christ 
u 
Ever 
hear 
of 
the 
resurrection 
of 
the 
dead 
It 
was 
a 
big 
deal 
to 
Paul 
We 
inherit 
the 
earth 
u 
His 
beauty 
was 
perfect 
u 
The 
Lord 
s 
Supper 
is 
a 
sign 
of 
the 
New 
Covenant 
and 
it 
was 
instituted 
by 
Christ 
Why 
were 
churches 
celebrating 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
New 
Covenant 
if 
it 
was 
just 
an 
Israel 
thing 
Huh 
u 
You 
define 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
God 
exactly 
like 
the 
Jewish 
zealots 
did 
Let 
me 
assure 
you 
that 
the 
zealots 
had 
the 
wrong 
definition 
It 
t 
Israel 
throwing 
out 
the 
Romans 
killing 
the 
sellouts 
and 
taking 
over 
the 
world 
with 
a 
sword 
u 
Absolutely 
not 
Could 
a 
perfected 
being 
do 
anything 
other 
than 
be 
perfect 
u 
Paul 
and 
everyone 
else 
preached 
the 
same 
message 
There 
s 
a 
new 
covenant 
that 
sees 
the 
signs 
symbols 
and 
shadows 
of 
the 
Old 
Covenant 
structure 
as 
historical 
relics 
Aside 
from 
that 
very 
little 
changed 
u 
The 
world 
was 
good 
not 
perfect

For 
neither

This 
generation 
will 
not 
pass 
away 
until 
all 
these 
things 
take 
place 
u 
If 
they 
were 
teaching 
the 
Kingdom 
was 
here 
and 
it 
did 
not 
occur 
then 
they 
are 
all 
false 
prophets 
t 
that 
bother 
you 
u 
Last 
time 
I 
checked 
promoting 
a 
false 
prophet 
was 
not 
neutral 
It 
was 
sinful 
If 
your 
system 
is 
correct 
then 
the 
NT 
is 
demonstrably 
false 
We 
are 
all 
wasting 
our 
time 
at 
best 
Or 
you 
can 
abandon 
your 
system 
and 
embrace 
the 
reformation 
Read 
Matthew 
It 
s 
about 
the 
destruction 
of 
city 
of 
Jerusalem 
and 
its 
Temple 
Jesus 
gave 
the 
prophecy 
circa 
A 
D 
He 
said 
it 
would 
happen 
in 
a 
generation 
which 
scripture 
sees 
as 
years 
The 
temple 
was 
destroyed 
in 
A 
D 
Jesus 
t 
a 
false 
prophet 
This 
means 
this 
and 
that 
means 
that 
It 
s 
hard 
to 
get 
around 
On 
his 
way 
to 
be 
crucified 
Jesus 
told 
the 
crowd 
not 
to 
weep 
for 
him 
They 
should 
weep 
for 
themselves 
and 
their 
children 
Later 
the 
crowd 
shouted 
let 
his 
blood 
be 
on 
us 
and 
our 
children 
Their 
generation 
u 
I 
treat 
parables 
as 
parables 
For 
instance 
I 
do 
not 
believe 
that 
the 
sheep 
and 
goat 
parable 
is 
about 
the 
biological 
creatures 
known 
specifically 
as 
and 
u 
I 
don 
t 
think 
we 
are 
talking 
about 
anything 
so 
physical 
God 
dwells 
in 
heaven 
The 
earth 
is 
a 
footstool 
The 
spirit 
goes 
to 
God 
when 
the 
body 
goes 
in 
the 
ground 
There 
are 
many 
figures 
of 
speech 
to 
describe 
this 
because 
hyper 
literal 
won 
t 
cut 
it 
u 
You 
think 
paradise 
is 
different 
from 
heaven 
Did 
you 
ever 
consider 
that 
scripture 
is 
not 
an 
owner 
s 
manual 
for 
a 
printer 
It 
is 
more 
like 
poetry 
intended 
to 
be 
evocative 
u 
Eccles 
the 
dust 
returns 
to 
the 
earth 
the 
spirit 
returns 
to 
God 
Obviously 
I 
agree 
with 
Paul 
The 
signs 
of 
the 
old 
covenant 
have 
been 
replaced 
by 
new 
symbols 
and 
or 
fulfilled 
in 
Christ 
Maybe 
he 
wants 
them 
not 
to 
convert 
so 
they 
can 
build 
the 
third 
temple 
and 
resume 
animal 
sacrifices 
I 
agree 
that 
you 
can 
teach 
children 
and 
new 
converts 
the 
practical 
application 
of 
being 
a 
Christian 
without 
pounding 
the 
law 
but 
you 
can 
t 
do 
it 
without 
the 
law 
There 
is 
no 
other 
standard 
t 
co 
When 
Paul 
addresses 
practical 
theology 
he 
turns 
to 
the 
law 
every 
single 
time 
Why 
Because 
he 
saw 
continuity 
God 
s 
standards 
t 
change 
Dishonoring 
your 
parents 
is 
unlawful 
under 
any 
administration 
The 
liberty 
of 
dishonoring 
one 
s 
parents 
Paul 
t 
want 
that 
What 
on 
earth 
are 
you 
talking 
about 
In 
Ephesians 
Paul 
tells 
children 
to 
honor 
their 
mother 
and 
father 
Where 
did 
he 
get 
that 
idea 
from 
Oh 
wait 
I 
know 
The 
LAW 
Paul 
expects 
Christians 
to 
walk 
in 
the 
spirit 
and 
if 
they 
wonder 
if 
they 
are 
doing 
that 
or 
not 
they 
turn 
to 
the 
law 
for 
God 
s 
standard 
How 
would 
you 
know 
The 
Bible 
t 
a 
newspaper 
If 
you 
want 
to 
see 
fulfillment 
you 
need 
to 
read 
other 
sources 
but 
you 
won 
t 
do 
that 
because 
you 
fancy 
yourself 
a 
bible 
only 
type 
of 
guy 
where 
did 
Paul 
ground 
his 
attack 
on 
that 
litany 
of 
sins 
His 
own 
personal 
preferences 
No 
It 
was 
in 
the 
LAW 
of 
God 
It 
was 
such 
common 
sense 
that 
it 
could 
have 
gone 
without 
saying 
Paul 
was 
about 
the 
signs 
of 
the 
Old 
Covenant 
being 
fulfilled 
The 
reason 
why 
is 
because 
independent 
is 
impractical 
How 
are 
you 
going 
to 
tell 
your 
kids 
not 
to 
steal 
when 
you 
drummed 
into 
them 
that 
Jesus 
abolished 
the 
th 
commandment 
It 
s 
schizo 
Just 
as 
anarchy 
trends 
towards 
tyranny 
independent 
trends 
towards 
independent 
legalism 
Many 
of 
your 
independent 
fundamentalist 
buds 
have 
made 
up 
their 
own 
new 
set 
of 
sins 
Drinking 
smoking 
movies 
music 
dancing 
not 
tucking 
in 
your 
shirt 
etc 
I 
take 
Jesus 
emphatic 
insistence 
of 
events 
happening 
during 
that 
generation 
literally 
I 
take 
shortly 
amp 
quickly 
come 
to 
pass 
literally 
I 
do 
not 
take 
a 
red 
dragon 
with 
heads 
amp 
horns 
literally 
especially 
when 
the 
writer 
tells 
me 
not 
to 
take 
that 
section 
literally 
I 
am 
not 
calling 
you 
a 
liar 
You 
probably 
do 
go 
out 
into 
the 
world 
and 
witness 
but 
I 
am 
saying 
you 
go 
out 
in 
the 
world 
to 
recruit 
people 
to 
come 
back 
with 
you 
into 
your 
proverbial 
bunker 
It 
is 
still 
escapist 
and 
retreat 
Like 
I 
said 
the 
Bible 
was 
treated 
as 
just 
the 
Bible 
Most 
churches 
with 
Bible 
in 
the 
name 
are 
churches 
Those 
sermons 
you 
heard 
where 
the 
preacher 
said 
I 
m 
just 
preaching 
from 
the 
Word 
of 
God 
were 
actually 
preaching 
from 
s 
reference 
notes 
That 
s 
your 
tradition 
Now 
you 
guys 
fight 
over 
how 
much 
to 
cut 
out 
of 
the 
Bible 
and 
how 
to 
practically 
live 
it 
You 
seem 
like 
a 
mid 
Acts 
camp 
type 
of 
guy 
but 
protocol 
insists 
that 
you 
don 
t 
admit 
stuff 
like 
that 
The 
Study 
Bible 
with 
its 
interpretive 
grid 
was 
embraced 
and 
spoken 
of 
as 
synonymous 
with 
the 
Bible 
so 
much 
so 
that 
independent 
fundamentalists 
t 
sure 
where 
one 
begins 
and 
the 
other 
ends 
It 
s 
all 
the 
same 
A 
huge 
chunk 
of 
Christian 
academics 
went 
liberal 
and 
the 
main 
people 
who 
stood 
up 
to 
the 
liberals 
were 
Calvinists 
Your 
lot 
retreated 
from 
the 
field 
into 
your 
bunkers 
and 
became 
obsessed 
with 
a 
mythical 
escapist 
rapture 
and 
enforced 
an 
anti 
intellectual 
culture 
It 
s 
like 
you 
think 
not 
having 
footnotes 
makes 
it 
less 
man 
made 
but 
it 
t 
It 
s 
just 
incredibly 
prideful 
and 
deceptive 
are 
you 
kidding 
me 
Do 
you 
have 
any 
idea 
how 
you 
look 
to 
everyone 
else 
You 
have 
a 
tradition 
of 
saying 
you 
don 
t 
have 
a 
tradition 
but 
you 
guys 
all 
say 
the 
same 
stuff 
do 
the 
same 
stuff 
and 
conform 
to 
the 
same 
stuff 
Look 
in 
the 
mirror 
Here 
s 
your 
problem 
and 
it 
is 
a 
rampant 
problem 
among 
independent 
fundamentalists 
you 
all 
say 
the 
same 
things 
and 
you 
pretend 
that 
you 
have 
no 
teachers 
you 
have 
only 
one 
book

you 
have 
no

Are

ashamed

names

with 
that 
attitude 
God 
is 
not 
done 
with 
China 
The 
whole 
world 
has 
been 
given 
to 
the 
the 
head 
of 
the 
church 
Jesus 
Israel 
was 
once 
the 
bride 
but 
it 
was 
replaced 
theologically 
and 
historically 
One 
was 
destroyed 
The 
other 
was 
given 
the 
world 
I 
do 
not 
get 
the 
obsession 
with 
a 
distinction 
destroyed 
t 
co 
Yeah 
it 
is 
the 
LAW 
written 
on 
the 
heart 
not 
the 
eradication 
of 
the 
law 
Why 
did 
Paul 
condemn 
idol 
worship 
commandment 
was 
for 
the 
Jews 
right 
Wrong 
You 
do 
not 
understand 
Paul 
There 
is 
no 
salvation 
outside 
of 
covenant 
You 
want 
one 
with 
out 
the 
other 
It 
does 
not 
work 
that 
way 
Hebrew 
was 
written 
to 
Christians 
and 
you 
pretend 
you 
can 
ignore 
it 
because 
of 
their 
DNA 
It 
is 
all 
about 
covenant 
not 
DNA 
You 
can 
t 
just 
dismiss 
a 
NT 
letter 
based 
on 
the 
DNA 
of 
the 
audience 
It 
is 
a 
weird 
way 
of 
reading 
the 
text 
Paul 
was 
not 
an 
antinomian 
like 
you 
For 
instance 
Paul 
says 
honor 
your 
parents 
th 
commandment 
Why 
The 
law 
was 
supposedly 
dead 
But 
here 
is 
the 
thing 
You 
do 
not 
understand 
Paul 
You 
reject 
most 
of 
the 
NT 
for 
being 
too 
for 
your 
liking 
One 
reason 
why 
it 
took 
so 
long 
to 
come 
on 
the 
scene 
is 
because 
it 
is 
built 
on 
a 
quasi 
racialist 
framework 
Christ 
obeyed 
the 
law 
of 
God 
so 
you 
do 
not 
have 
to 
huh 
Hath 
he 
mercy 
on 
whom 
he 
will 
have 
mercy 
and 
whom 
he 
will 
he 
If 
He 
hardened 
me 
then 
it 
s 
His 
fault 
not 
mine 
Nay 
but 
O 
man 
who 
art 
thou 
that 
against 
God 
Shall 
the 
thing 
formed 
say 
to 
him 
that 
formed 
it 
Why 
hast 
thou 
made 
me 
thus 
Dang 
We 
are 
commanded 
to 
love 
God 
and 
one 
another 
is 
the 
law 
Salt 
amp 
Light 
rejects 
that 
as 
just 
being 
for 
the 
Jews 
Yep 
I 
don 
t 
steal 
and 
I 
council 
others 
not 
to 
steal 
I 
m 
basically 
going 
around 
forcing 
people 
to 
get 
circumcised 
are 
you 
for 
real 
You 
sound 
like 
the 
person 
in 
error 
in 
Romans 
WHY 
DOES 
HE 
STILL 
FIND 
FAULT 
A 
lot 
of 
Christians 
still 
break 
the 
law 
of 
God 
What 
are 
you 
going 
to 
say 
to 
them 
You 
t 
steal 
Why 
We 
t 
under 
the 
law 
Well 
then 
you 
t 
want 
to 
steal 
Why 
We 
t 
under 
the 
law 
Without 
the 
law 
of 
God 
there 
is 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
sin 
and 
if 
there 
s 
no 
such 
thing 
as 
sin 
then 
there 
s 
nothing 
to 
repent 
of 
which 
is 
why 
Salt 
amp 
Light 
rejects 
repentance 
Some 
people 
smoke 
cigars 
other 
people 
murder 
It 
s 
all 
the 
same 
Christians 
in 
the 
Age 
of 
Grace 
can 
do 
whatever 
they 
want 
as 
long 
as 
they 
believe 
in 
the 
finished 
work 
of 
Christ 
James 
says 
nope 
But 
t 
you 
filed 
that 
under 
Christian 
liberty 
Well 
if 
you 
think 
that 
because 
you 
said 
a 
prayer 
when 
you 
were 
sixteen 
that 
you 
can 
go 
murdering 
people 
because 
thou 
shalt 
not 
murder 
was 
just 
for 
the 
Jews 
then 
roll 
those 
dice 
That 
s 
not 
my 
call 
but 
you 
are 
rolling 
the 
dice 
If 
God 
t 
want 
you 
to 
take 
James 
seriously 
then 
He 
t 
have 
preserved 
the 
letter 
It 
would 
have 
been 
lost 
to 
history 
He 
preserved 
it 
and 
expects 
you 
to 
be 
held 
accountable 
for 
its 
content 
You 
got 
no 
excuse 
James 
says 
that 
if 
you 
go 
around 
saying 
things 
like 
I 
believe 
in 
this 
correct 
doctrine 
and 
that 
correct 
doctrine 
and 
all 
I 
have 
to 
do 
is 
have 
faith 
and 
I 
don 
t 
need 
to 
have 
any 
fruit 
then 
it 
s 
a 
dead 
faith 
that 
can 
t 
save 
It 
counts 
for 
nothing 
I 
t 
think 
you 
did 
dismiss 
it 
Salt 
amp 
Light 
dismisses 
the 
book 
of 
James 
as 
not 
being 
for 
him 
He 
thinks 
it 
s 
just 
for 
the 
Jews 
I 
know 
you 
two 
are 
on 
the 
same 
page 
against 
reformed 
theology 
but 
you 
should 
know 
that 
he 
only 
believes 
that 
parts 
of 
Paul 
is 
relevant 
to 
him 
Heather 
if 
you 
take 
the 
book 
of 
James 
seriously 
and 
don 
t 
dismiss 
it 
as 
just 
for 
the 
Jews 
then 
you 
got 
nothing 
to 
worry 
about 
I 
know 
that 
s 
what 
you 
think 
is 
true 
I 
m 
just 
pointing 
out 
that 
you 
re 
rolling 
the 
dice 
if 
you 
walk 
your 
talk 
You 
been 
warned 
And 
it 
does 
so 
by 
telling 
people 
not 
to 
take 
the 
warnings 
of 
James 
seriously 
James 
was 
emphatic 
about 
what 
actually 
saves 
and 
what 
is 
deception 
and 
put 
their 
faith 
in 
their 
system 
rolling 
the 
dice 
with 
the 
hopes 
that 
James 
warnings 
t 
for 
them 
Salvation 
is 
the 
consequence 
of 
communion 
with 
Yahweh 
It 
t 
get 
more 
explicit 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Abraham 
Man 
made 
Man 
centered 
How 
much 
do 
you 
know 
about 
the 
history 
of 
YOUR 
system 
t 
co 
Good 
morning 
to 
you 
as 
well 
I 
am 
not 
just 
engaging 
in 
wild 
speculation 
It 
s 
the 
general 
assessment 
of 
scholars 
who 
have 
actually 
studied 
the 
works 
of 
the 
ancients 
from 
various 
cultures 
Here 
s 
the 
thing 
Moses 
t 
a 
modernist 
or 
classical 
liberal 
Neither 
were 
the 
prophets 
or 
psalmists 
or 
Jesus 
or 
apostles 
So 
when 
we 
take 
those 
ideas 
and 
pretend 
they 
re 
presuppositions 
of 
ancients 
it 
is 
not 
being 
a 
Bible 
only 
type 
of 
guy 
It 
s 
being 
a 
modernist 
liberal 
Sorry 
This 
was 
a 
long 
about 
way 
of 
saying 
that 
I 
don 
t 
think 
freewill 
advocates 
are 
borrowing 
from 
the 
necessarily 
They 
are 
dipping 
into 
the 
same 
historical 
ideological 
trends 
that 
the 
dipped 
into 
to 
get 
their 
ideas 
It 
s 
modernism 
classical 
liberalism 
Modern 
US 
evangelicals 
have 
a 
different 
approach 
they 
project 
their 
post 
Declaration 
of 
Independence 
thoughts 
about 
the 
state 
on 
to 
God 
He 
s 
not 
King 
We 
elect 
Him 
He 
can 
t 
tell 
us 
what 
to 
do 
We 
have 
rights 
It 
s 
pretty 
silly 
I 
say 
anachronistically 
appear 
because 
they 
did 
not 
truly 
think 
like 
moderns 
It 
was 
tied 
to 
their 
theologically 
low 
view 
of 
god 
s 
being 
so 
far 
off 
apathetic 
and 
or 
weak 
that 
there 
was 
no 
meddling 
in 
worldly 
affairs 
Yep 
Freewill 
in 
it 
s 
purest 
articulation 
is 
a 
modern 
phenomenon 
in 
the 
history 
of 
human 
ideas 
The 
ancients 
t 
really 
think 
about 
it 
like 
us 
Of 
those 
who 
anachronistically 
appear 
to 
think 
like 
moderns 
are 
two 
groups 
vilified 
in 
scripture 
the 
Sadducee 
and 
Epicureans 
The 
third 
person 
of 
the 
trinity 
was 
not 
a 
NT 
phenomenon 
The 
HS 
is 
all 
over 
the 
OT 
The 
HS 
inspired 
the 
writers 
and 
prophets 
There 
were 
of 
the 
HS 
The 
NT 
is 
more 
about 
the 
pouring 
out 
of 
the 
spirit 
on 
a 
massive 
scale 
All 
the 
OT 
rituals 
were 
types 
and 
shadows 
that 
pointed 
to 
Christ 
It 
looked 
forward 
to 
that 
great 
day 
just 
as 
our 
rituals

Does 
a 
mighty 
God 
scare 
you 
Yeah 
the 
Reformation 
emerged 
out 
of 
Roman 
Catholicism 
to 
critique 
it 
with 
a 
passion 
You 
act 
like 
that 
s 
a 
silver 
bullet 
or 
not 
known 
to 
everyone 
already 
you 
have 
dismissed 
most 
of 
scripture 
and 
you 
wanna 
lecture 
remove 
the 
Judaism 
from 
him 
It 
s 
just 
worshiping 
Yahweh 
who 
did 
something 
big 
during 
Paul 
s 
lifetime 
and 
decided 
to 
use 
Paul 
to 
further 
the 
plan 
that 
was 
laid 
out 
from 
the 
beginning 
bringing 
the 
world 
to 
Yahweh 
I 
d 
have 
to 
check 
my 
notes 
but 
I 
believe 
there 
was 
a 
Jewish 
expulsion 
from 
Rome 
around 
that 
time 
It 
s 
not 
that 
important 
The 
point 
is 
Paul 
was 
getting 
down 
to 
the 
basics 
Every 
single 
genuine 
conversion 
is 
an 
act 
of 
divine 
intervention 
from 
the 
Trinity 
working 
together 
to 
bring 
a 
person 
to 
faith 
and 
communion 
God 
is 
not 
on 
vacation 
He 
is 
running 
the 
universe 
according 
to 
His 
plan 
no 
It 
s 
called 
or 
It 
was 
the 
common 
Rabbinic 
system 
for 
passing 
on 
knowledge 
from 
a 
Rabbi 
to 
a 
student 
who 
would 
become 
an 
authoritative 
teacher 
It 
s 
the 
basis 
for 
the 
Paul 
s 
teacher 
was 
Jesus 
not 
a 
human 
teacher 
like 
one 
of 
the 
Casting 
out 
demons 
Healing 
Speaking 
other

human 
languages 
Prophesying 
Visions 
for 
starters 
there 
s 
scripture 
written 
after 
the 
road 
to 
Damascus 
That 
s 
a 
divine 
intervention 
unless 
you 
don 
t 
believe 
that 
scripture 
is 
inspired 
It 
s 
context 
Paul 
was 
breaking 
down 
all 
of 
history 
into 
a 
crash 
course 
for 
people 
who 
had 
no 
idea 
about 
Yahweh 
The 
other 
writers 
assumed 
the 
readers 
had 
a 
lot 
more 
knowledge 
then 
Paul 
WOW 
that 
s 
a 
stretch 
What 
Paul 
is 
saying 
is 
that 
he 
t 
sit 
at 
the 
feet 
of 
Peter 
or 
James 
or 
John 
and 
memorize 
their 
sayings 
as 
was 
typical 
in 
the 
rabbinic 
system 
of 
teaching

WOW 
That 
s 
a 
bold 
statement 
Paul 
was 
attacking 
the 
heretics 
and 
you 
re 
setting 
him 
against 
Jesus 
and 
the 
twelve 
apostles 
You 
don 
t 
need 
to 
do 
this 
If 
you 
think 
Jesus 
was 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
and 
the 
were 
in 
opposition 
to 
Paul 
and 
Paul 
was 
in 
opposition 
to 
Jesus 
then 
you 
don 
t

Third 
person 
of 
the

Satan 
pretends 
that 
he 
is 
free 
and 
he 
is 
furthering 
his 
plans 
but 
scripture 
makes 
it 
crystal 
clear 
that 
Satan 
is 
insane 
for 
thing 
thinking 
that 
he 
is 
doing 
anything 
other 
than 
inadvertently 
furthering 
God 
s 
decree 
But 
very 
accurate 
I 
d 
throw 
in 
the 
word 
liberal 
too 
You 
don 
t 
think 
the 
Spirit 
prevents 
you 
from 
doing 
things 
you 
would 
have 
otherwise 
wanted 
to 
do 
How 
does 
it 
make 
you 
feel 
that 
the 
Spirit 
is 
basically 
trampling 
on 
your 
autonomy 
Is 
that 
how 
you 
feel 
Yahweh 
took 
away 
His 
Spirit 
from 
Saul 
and 
sent 
an 
evil 
one 
so 
that 
Saul 
would 
mess 
up 
and 
David 
could 
get 
the 
thrown 
Yahweh 
is 
the 
God 
of 
history 
He 
does 
what 
He 
pleases 
Faith 
involves 
trusting 
in 
His 
Wisdom 
in 
running 
all 
things 
From 
the 
way 
anti 
Reformed 
folk 
talk 
what 
Yahweh 
did 
to 
s 
heart 
was 
basically 
rape 
But 
but 
but 
what 
about 
autonomous 
free 
will 
I 
will 
harden 
Pharaoh 
s 
heart 
and 
multiply 
my 
signs 
and 
my 
wonders 
in 
the 
land 
of 
Egypt 
But 
the 
Spirit 
of 
the 
Lord 
departed 
from 
Saul 
and 
an 
evil 
spirit 
from 
the 
Lord 
troubled 
him 
Therefore 
hath 
he 
mercy 
on 
whom 
he 
will 
have 
mercy 
and 
whom 
he 
will 
he 
I 
form 
the

and 
create

I 
make

all 
these 
things 
I

Fall 
world 
When 
we 
die 
and 
our 
nature 
is 
perfected 
we 
don 
t 
lose 
our 
to 
sin 
and 
become 
mindless 
puppets 
We 
will 
have 
no 
natural 
inclination 
to 
sin

an 
imported 
distraction 
Yahweh 
is 
immutable 
He 
is 
merciful 
to 
His 
people 
at 
all 
times 
and 
He 
brings 
them 
to 
Himself 
If

you 
should 
be 
expected

I 
think 
it 
s 
frustrating 
sad 
interesting 
that 
when 
teaching

commute 
This 
is 
the 
final 
episode 
of 
our 
series 
through 
Kingdom 
Prologue 
amp 
I 
discuss 
fascinating 
parallels 
between 
Jesus 
The 
Church 
of 
England 
used 
to 
be 
a 
trend 
setter 
crafting 
the 
beautiful 
Book 
of 
Common 
Prayer 
and 
the 
translation 
of 
the 
B 
It 
would 
be 
silly 
to 
talk 
about 
anteaters 
choosing 
not 
to 
hunt 
down 
and 
devour 
live 
birds 
because 
they 
voluntarily 
chose 
to 
eat 
ants 
instead 
Scripture 
talks 
of 
nature 
Certain 
types 
of 
trees 
producing 
certain 
types 
of 
fruit 
It 
does 
not 
talk 
about 
autonomous 
free 
will 
He 
just 
decrees 
things 
like 
finding 
a 
good 
parking 
spot 
You 
re 
pro 
witch 
You 
act 
as 
if 
He 
s 
no 
longer 
in 
control 
of 
history 
Psst 
the 
Pilgrims 
were 
hardcore 
Calvinists 
So 
you 
think 
the 
age 
of 
grace 
is 
characterized 
by 
God 
s 
abandonment 
I 
t 
disagree 
more 
I 
don 
t 
expect 
you 
to 
change 
on 
it 
You 
re 
deeply 
committed 
to 
Yes 
God 
is 
not 
on 
vacation 
running 
some 
other 
universe 
Godless 
regimes 
doing 
godless 
things 
is 
a 
form 
of 
judgment 
and 
instead 
of 
seeing 
it 
as 
such 
you 
pretend 
God 
is 
on 
vacation 
I 
know 
your 
peculiar 
brand 
of 
eschatology 
Don 
t 
want 
to 
go 
there 
but 
you 
asked 
for 
an 
explanation 
that 
t 
involve 
God 
going 
on 
vacation 
from 
running 
the 
universe 
I 
gave 
one 
God 
is 
in 
control 
He 
s 
judging 
nations 
and 
churches 
Why 
would 
God 
allow 
King 
David 
to 
sin 
so 
publicly 
and 
make 
it 
completely 
clear 
that 
he 
t 
the 
messiah 
Judgment 
Germany 
was 
the 
first 
to 
go 
modernist 
God 
took 
their 
light 
stand 
and 
they 
got 
their 
judgment 
It 
was 
horrific 
American 
Churches 
without 
light 
stands 
will 
get 
their 
own 
form 
of 
judgment 
Congrats 
You 
turned 
Christianity 
into 
just 
another 
philosophy 
It 
is 
interesting 
It 
s 
called 
regeneration 
You 
need 
to 
pick 
one 
Are 
we 
driven 
by 
our 
nature 
or 
by 
our 
free 
will 
You 
should 
boast 
more 
You 
got 
the 
power 
Give 
yourself 
a 
pat 
on 
the 
back 
That 
s 
self 
election 
So 
humans 
elect 
to 
be 
elect 
It 
s 
a 
sovereign 
decision 
In 
the 
final 
analysis 
when 
viewed 
in 
the 
fullness 
of 
God 
s 
power 
people 
don 
t 
pick 
their 
parents 
They 
don 
t 
pick 
to 
be 
in 
the 
body 
I 
believe 
in 
corporate 
election 
Some 
are 
called 
into 
the 
body 
via 
conversion 
Others 
are 
brought 
into 
the 
body 
via 
faithful 
parents 
faithfully 
raising 
their 
children 
into 
it 
from 
childhood 
Nobody 
outside 
the 
body 
in 
a 
non 
temporal 
sense 
is 
elect 
Desire 
Cool 
Apply 
that 
logic 
to 
everything 
else 
I 
have 
no 
idea 
what 
you 
re 
talking 
about 
We 
t 
using 
the 
same 
lingo 
in 
the 
same 
way 
We 
t 
even 
on 
the 
same 
page 
of 
talking 
about 
a 
post 
Gen 
world 
Regeneration 
excludes 
even 
the 
possibility 
of 
rejecting 
the 
gospel 
That 
s 
the 
point 
Unregenerate 
man 
hears 
a 
sermon 
and 
dismisses 
it 
The 
same 
man 
could 
hear 
the 
same 
exact 
sermon 
after 
regeneration 
and 
be 
struck 
to 
his 
knees 
Most 
people 
who 
convert 
have 
heard 
the 
same 
message 
many 
times 
before 
but 
at 
some 
point 
it 
clicks 
Regeneration 
is 
what 
makes 
the 
click 
possible 
It 
happens 
before 
every 
real 
conversion 
It 
s 
hard 
to 
describe 
because 
it 
is 
subconscious 
but 
it 
happens 
The 
argument 
is 
that 
once 
the 
spirit 
regenerates 
the 
person 
always 
gravitates 
towards 
belief 
Talk 
to 
a 
convert 
They 
will 
likely 
tell 
you 
that 
they 
experienced 
something 
difficult 
to 
describe 
just 
prior 
to 
faith 
It 
s 
the 
subconscious 
regeneration 
becoming 
conscious 
faith 
Is 
God 
a 
hypocrite 
for 
judging 
people 
who 
murder 
people 
by 
drowning 
them 
in 
the 
Red 
Sea 
when 
God 
drowned 
the 
Egyptians 
in 
the 
Red 
Sea 
Please 
let 
that 
sink 
in 
We 
are 
not 
equal 
with 
God 
I 
already 
accused 
you 
having 
a 
non 
theological 
understanding 
of 
evil 
I 
just 
accused 
you 
have 
having 
a 
non 
theological 
understanding 
of 
hypocrisy 
I 
m 
not 
going 
down 
the 
path 
with 
you 
into 
category 
errors 
that 
seem 
to 
run 
deep 
in 
your 
man 
centered 
set 
of 
assumptions 
about 
God 
You 
must 
be 
very 
confident 
that 
I 
am 
wrong 
because 
you 
are 
playing 
with 
fire 
You 
also 
seem 
to 
be 
misusing 
the 
word 
hypocrite 
I 
find 
that 
hard 
to 
believe 
for 
sin 
Do 
you 
just 
do 
topical 
preaching 
The 
thief 
on 
the 
cross 
t 
an 
accident 
of 
history 
He 
was 
meant 
to 
be 
there 
Like 
I 
said 
don 
t 
play 
around 
with 
secret 
decrees 
It 
is 
not 
our 
business 
Just 
follow 
the 
law 
of 
God 
giving 
people 
over 
to 
lies 
and 
delusions 
is 
a 
form 
of 
divine 
Prohibitions 
against 
stealing 
are 
found 
in 
the 
Old 
Testament 
law 
Since 
Jesus 
t 
steal 
did 
he 
abolish 
the 
prohibition 
against 
theft 
for 
everyone 
You 
re 
confusing 
this 
I 
m 
saying 
get 
out 
of 
God 
s 
business 
of 
how 
He 
decides 
to 
run 
the 
universe 
It 
s 
not 
your 
concern 
Soldiers 
don 
t 
need 
to 
be 
in

Room 
with

orders

The 
secret 
things 
belong 
to 
the 
Lord 
our 
God 
but 
the 
things 
that 
are 
revealed 
belong 
to 
us 
and 
to 
our 
children 
forever 
that 
we 
may 
do 
all 
the 
words 
of 
this 
law 
God 
cannot 
be 
evil 
since 
evil 
is 
defined 
in 
terms 
of 
human 
rebellion 
not 
in 
terms 
of 
preference 
In 
case 
of 
a 
boring 
long 
commute 
the 
audio 
version 
might 
come 
in 
handy 
t 
co 
It 
s 
not 
an 
defense 
It 
s 
a 
commandment 
God 
specifically 
said 
mind 
your 
own 
business 
and 
don 
t 
be 
a 
busybody 
about 
how 
He 
runs 
the 
universe 
Sin 
and 
evil 
exist 
only 
within 
the 
context 
of 
disobeying 
God 
Recognize 
the 
hierarchy 
The 
secret 
things 
belong 
to 
the 
Lord 
our 
God 
but 
the 
things 
that 
are 
revealed 
belong 
to 
us 
and 
to 
our 
children 
forever 
that 
we 
may 
do 
all 
the 
words 
of 
this 
law 
Don 
t 
worry 
about 
God 
s 
secret 
decrees 
Follow 
the 
law 
God 
does 
not 
create 
people 
to 
go 
hell 
is 
what 
you 
said 
It 
sure 
sounded 
like 
a 
statement 
about 
His 
character 
If 
that 
is 
not 
what 
you 
meant 
please 
accept 
my 
apologies 
The 
reason 
I 
dwell 
on 
that 
is 
that 
God 
s 
character 
is 
the 
same 
now 
as 
it 
was 
in 
BC 
and 
you 
re 
making 
an 
argument 
about 
God 
s 
character 
I 
don 
t 
have 
a 
problem 
with 
that 
I 
m 
not 
embarrassed 
of 
God 
He 
shows 
mercy 
on 
who 
He 
wills 
I 
m 
not 
the 
lawyer 
for 
the 
reprobate 
Could 
God 
have 
sent 
them 
prophets 
if 
He 
really 
wanted 
to 
save 
them 
all 
Yes 
Did 
He 
No 
Basically 
not 
a 
single 
person 
on 
that 
continent 
was 
in 
a 
relationship 
with 
Yahweh 
and 
He 
did 
nothing 
to 
change 
that 
The 
year 
is 
BC 
The 
place 
is 
South 
America 
Where 
are 
the 
prophets 
of 
Yahweh 
You 
act 
like 
this 
is 
somehow 
out 
of 
character 
for 
God 
Prior 
to 
the 
Great 
Commission 
it 
was 
not 
even 
a 
point 
of 
discussion 
that 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
humanity 
was 
destined 
for 
destruction 
and 
God 
was 
free 
to 
do 
that 
Now 
Christians 
act 
like 
that 
is 
weird 
What 
about 
resources 
for 
decolonizing 
our 
religious 
institutions 
from 
the 
flag 
bearers 
of 
modernism 
and 
Paul 
Who 
did 
he 
murder 
Does 
it 
make 
a 
difference 
that 
Peter 
was 
an 
oppressed 
colonized 
victim 
and 
the 
people 
he 
was 
being 
prejudice 
to 
were 
from 
the 
dominant 
oppressive 
culture 
the 
dangerous 
doctrine 
that 
you 
re 
talking 
about 
is 
built 
on 
the 
idea 
that 
all 
who 
believe 
will 
be 
saved 
Who 
told 
you 
otherwise 
The 
church 
is 
essential 
Unity 
is 
essential 
Confessions 
are 
essential 
to 
unity 
in 
the 
church 
It 
all 
points 
to 
Christ 
the 
king 
of 
the 
church 
who 
wants 
a 
united 
body 
not 
individualistic 
anarchy 
It 
is 
a 
radically 
different 
view 
of 
the 
church 
I 
get 
the 
feeling 
that 
baptists 
see 
the 
church 
as 
unnecessary 
as 
the 
confessions 
The 
church 
is 
merely 
helpful 
You 
need 
the 
confessions

I 
are 
almost 
finished

major 
problem 
in 
the

to 
be 
more 
of 
a 
thing

it 
might 
be 
good 
to 
have 
some 
clarity 
on 
the 
issue 
if 
it 
could 
be 
handled 
correctly 
There 
is 
a 
lot 
of 
room 
to 
disagree

might 
accuse 
an 
of 
twisting 
scripture 
and

A 
young 
earth 
proponent 
might 
accuse 
a 
frame 
worker 
of 
twisting 
scripture 
and 
vise

We 
have 
to 
avoid 
setting 
up 
kangaroo 
courts 
over

would 
assume 
so 
In 
my 
opinion 
is 
playing 
with 
fire 
but 
nothing 
concrete 
has 
been 
broken 
that 
would 
hold 
up 
in 
a 
hearing 
Twisting 
scripture 
in 
a 
way 
that 
went 
against 
the 
Westminster 
Standards 
would 
be 
grounds 
for 
charges 
especially 
in 
the 
setting 
of 
public 
worship 
However 
I 
believe 
pastors 
are 
allowed 
to 
file 
disagreements 
with 
the 
standards 
on 
a 
point 
or 
two 
Well 
the 
started 
as 
a 
coalition 
of 
Presbyterians 
disaffected 
with 
the 
It 
included 
evangelicals 
etc 
I 
don 
t 
think 
was 
super 
distraught 
about 
this 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
formation 
had 
the 
correct 
view 
on 
prohibition 
Biblical 
law 
does 
not 
forbid 
alcohol 
Those 
in 
favor 
of 
prohibition 
were 
replacing 
the 
text 
with 
modernist 
theories 
I 
would 
argue 
the 
same 
about 
gun 
control 
However 
this 
t 
heresy 
It 
s 
symptomatic 
of 
something 
though 
Do 
you 
know 
what 
fake 
means 
A 
fake 
seizure 
is 
not 
a 
seizure 
Are 
we 
done 
here 
So 
if 
I 
pretend 
to 
have 
a 
disease 
and 
someone 
calls 
me 
out 
then 
the 
proper 
response 
is 
to 
stick 
up 
for 
the 
faker 
in 
the 
name 
of 
the 
people 
who 
have 
the 
disease 
Okay 
that 
is 
not 
how 
things 
work 
If 
you 
have 
a 
fake 
seizure 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
a 
service 
that

up

up 
this 
ritualized 
blasphemy

some 
blasphemously 
fake 
it 
and 
people 
who 
see 
it 
know 
they 
blasphemously 
fake 
it 
but 
they 
tolerate 
the 
blasphemy 
because 
they 
want 
to 
be 
entertained 
It 
is 
not 
worship 
I

what

bored

babbling 
and 
false 
miracles 
and 
false

get 
embarrassed

Apostolic

what 
happens 
when

The

the 
most 
liturgical 
NT 
book 
Kinda 
weird 
Any 
appeal 
for 
societal 
justice 
that 
is 
not 
explicitly 
grounded 
in 
the 
law 
of 
God 
is 
activism 
in 
the 
cause 
of 
unholiness 
It 
s 
symptomatic 
of 
something 
deeper

in 
all 
fairness

strongly

foreign 
to

What 
we

an 
extension 
of 
what 
we 
are 
Reality 
is 
that 
the

is 
a 
theocracy 
and 
Christ 
is 
king 
Right 
now 
sex 
offenders 
are 
marginalized 
and 
people 
are 
okay 
with 
that 
It 
is 
only 
a 
matter 
of 
time 
before 
secularists 
change 
their 
minds 
about 
the 
compassion 
of 
that 
and 
Christians 
without 
a 
foundation 
will 
follow 
them 
with 
some 
Jesus 
sprinkled 
into 
an 
otherwise 
secular 
argument 
Given 
the 
assumption 
that 
you 
appear 
to 
consider 
God 
s 
Law 
to 
be 
moot 
it 
seems 
that 
all 
this 
is 
relative 
to 
shifting 
opinions 
in 
the 
secular 
world 
about 
what 
is 
considered 
compassionate 
From 
my 
perspective 
you 
outsourced 
God 
s 
Law 
to 
secular 
social 
sciences 
and 
the 
latest 
popular 
opinions 
of 
men 
from 
a 
contemporary 
liberal 
perspective 
Okay 
so 
your 
approach 
is 
not 
fundamentally 
different 
from 
an 
unbeliever 
on 
this 
and 
perhaps 
most 
issues 
right 
so 
it 
is 
relative 
sure 
how 
do 
you 
define

Who

to

What 
you 
are 
telling 
people 
is 
confusing 
them 
So 
when 
I 
repented 
and 
believed 
is 
that 
when

just

When 
you 
consider 
the 
terms 
and 
conditions 
not 
to 
mention 
the 
names 
already 
written 
in 
the 
book 
of 
life 
from 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
world 
it 
is 
at 
best 
deceptive 
to 
talk 
about 
unlimited 
atonement 
This 
is 
a 
really 
important 
consideration 
for 
our 
friends 
from 
the 
broader 
evangelical 
world 
There 
s 
a 
high 
likelihood 
I 
m 
sorry 
but 
I 
work 
in 
advertising 
and 
it 
would 
be 
illegal 
to 
run 
an 
advert 
for 
unlimited 
atonement 
and 
have 
that 
many 
conditions 
applied 
to 
it 
Why 
not 
just 
be 
honest 
about 
it 
Jesus 
died 
to 
atone 
for 
the 
sins 
of 
His 
people 
So 
when 
you 
read 
And 
she 
will 
bring 
forth 
a 
Son 
and 
you 
shall 
call 
His 
name 
Jesus 
for 
He 
will 
save 
His 
people 
from 
their 
sins 
do 
you 
see 
His 
people 
as 
the 
whole 
world 
So 
when 
you 
read 
For 
this 
is 
My 
blood 
of 
the 
new 
covenant 
which 
is 
shed 
for

What 
do 
you 
think 
Do 
you 
understand 
the 
objections 
to 
this 
Yep 
About 
a 
year 
ago 
On 
the 
lower 
level 
yes 
Yes 
to 
all 
of 
the 
above 
You 
are 
stuck 
on 
the 
lower 
level 
and 
the 
very 
discussion 
of 
the 
upper 
level 
clearly 
confuses 
you 
and 
you 
lash 
out 
t 
that 
confusion 
been 
the 
root 
of 
this 
entire 
debate 
I 
could 
not 
disagree 
more 
If 
that 
s 
your 
genuine 
perspective 
then 
it 
is 
perfectly 
understandable 
why 
you 
have 
such 
a 
problem 
with 
reformed 
thought 
Scripture 
gives 
us 
insight 
into 
the 
upper 
register 
Reformed 
thought 
expounds 
on 
it 
On 
the 
lower 
register 
i 
e 
forensically 
speaking 
in 
our 
dimension 
where 
time 
is 
linear 
and 
our 
understanding 
is 
finite 
yes 
That 
s 
only 
part 
of 
the 
picture 
though 
Obviously 
by 
mentioning 
Pol 
Pot 
I 
t 
quoting 
scripture 
I 
m 
making 
this 
real 
If 
Christ 
died 
for 
Pol 
Pot 
that 
means 
he 
died 
in 
Pol 
Pot 
s 
place 
That 
means 
Pol 
Pot 
actually 
receives 
Christ 
s 
righteousness 
Christ 
either 
took 
the 
proverbial 
bullet 
for 
Pol 
Pot 
and 
therefore 
Pol 
Pot 
has 
eternal 
life 
or 
Christ 
did 
not 
jump 
in 
front 
of 
the 
bullet 
to 
save 
Pol 
Pot 
Substitutionary 
atonement 
requires 
a 
real 
substitution 
not 
platitudes 
God 
has 
love 
and 
wrath 
for 
Pol 
Pot 
Jesus 
died 
for 
him 
but 
not 
really 
Kinda 
confusing 
Wow 
if 
you 
read 
my 
tweets 
so 
poorly 
it 
is 
no 
wonder 
you 
have 
such 
an 
odd 
interpretation 
of 
scripture 
God 
s 
redemptive 
love 
is 
the 
theme 
of 
the 
entire 
Bible 
I 
thought 
that 
was 
an 
answer 
He 
loved 
us 
while 
we 
were 
still 
sinners 
because 
He 
had 
a 
redemptive 
plan 
set 
in 
place 
from 
the 
beginning 
I 
d 
have 
to 
do 
a 
word 
study 
of 
the 
use 
of 
the 
word 
wrath 
Simple 
He 
t 
have 
redemptive 
love 
for 
the 
reprobate 
That 
s 
why 
limited 
atonement 
is 
the 
best 
logical 
and 
scriptural 
answer 
to 
your 
conundrum 
I 
d 
have 
to 
give 
that 
some 
more 
thought 
and 
study 
but 
my 
gut 
reaction 
is 
that 
there 
was 
never 
a 
millisecond 
where 
God 
did 
not 
know 
how 
things 
would 
unfold 
I 
t 
surprise 
Him 
by 
submitting 
to 
His 
Lordship 
That 
depends 
as 
well 
Everything 
I 
did 
as 
an 
unbeliever 
culminated 
ultimately 
in 
my 
belief 
Do 
I 
believe 
that 
it 
could 
have 
went 
any 
other 
way 
No 
Everything 
went 
according 
to 
God 
s 
plan 
God 
is 
all 
those 
things 
for 
His 
people 
As 
for 
the 
rebels 
He 
damns 
them 
You 
got 
misplace 
sympathy 
t 
co 
Ya 
It 
depends 
on 
how 
much 
you 
want 
to 
consider 
it 
but 
if 
I 
understand 
what 
you 
re 
getting 
at 
I 
d 
say 
the 
big 
moment 
was 
the 
cross 
So 
how 
do 
you 
limit 
the 
unlimited 
specific 
yet 
universal 
everyone 
but 
not 
everyone 
all 
but 
not 
all 
I 
am 
following 
it 
That 
s 
your 
main 
point 
is 
that 
God 
is 
all 
love 
and 
mercy 
and 
Jesus 
paid 
the 
price 
for 
everyone 
s 
sins 
and 
Calvinists 
make 
God 
look 
mean 
by 
talking 
about 
His 
power 
and 
justice 
If 
Jesus 
was 
the 
atonement 
for 
Pol 
Pot 
then 
that 
means 
God 
t 
see 
his 
sins 
He 
s 
singing 
with 
the 
choir 
right 
now

honestly 
don

you 
do 
is 
jump 
on

and 
blast 
everyone 
for 
what 
you 
think 
they 
believe 
and 
reject 
correction 
by 
the 
people 
you 
are 
accusing 
But 
I 
thought 
you 
were 
preaching 
that 
God 
was 
all 
love 
and 
peace 
signs 
and 
mercy 
to 
the 
max 
for 
every 
single 
person 
ever 
Jesus 
t 
die 
for 
Pol 
Pot 
to 
show 
sweet 
kisses 
and 
hugs 
Pol 
Pot 
will 
get 
what 
he 
deserves 
and 
if 
you 
think 
what 
he 
deserves 
is 
God 
showering 
mercy 
and 
love 
for 
all 
including 
Pol 
Pot 
then 
you 
have 
no 
grasp 
on

eschatology

Because 
that

what

entertainment

what

who

false 
prophecies

a 
sense 
that 
you 
are 
talking 
in 
way 
too 
individualistic 
terms 
If 
we 
started 
handling 
these 
prophets 
like 
Moses 
said 
we 
should 
how 
many 
would 
be 
jabbering 
It 
would 
be 
the 
end 
of 
your 
movement 
God 
saves 
sinners 
I 
ll 
reiterate 
if 
you 
want 
to 
understand 
reformed 
thought 
you 
need 
to 
stop 
thinking 
in 
individualistic 
terms 
and 
start 
thinking 
in 
terms 
of 
covenant 
And 
this 
is 
supposed 
to 
impress 
unbelievers 
how 
First 
off 
t 
you 
just 
make 
a 
case 
that 
Romans 
is 
about 
God 
hating 
a 
whole 
nation 
Secondly 
God 
loves 
His 
people 
How 
is 
that 
not 
clear 
from 
scripture 
Yes 
they 
understood 
the 
real 
languages 
that 
they 
were 
really 
speaking 
The 
one 
speaking 
Arabic 
it 
would 
sound 
like 
gibberish 
to 
me 
because 
I 
don 
t 
speak 
Arabic 
To 
the 
Arabian 
it 
would 
have 
made 
sense 
because 
it 
was 
a 
REAL 
language 
not 
babble

People

That 
s 
the 
point 
of 
reformed 
theology 
Are 
you 
in 
the 
covenant 
or 
are 
you 
out 
if 
it 
Reprobates 
want 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
it 
God 
softens 
the 
heart 
of 
sinners 
and 
brings 
them 
into 
the 
covenant 
Unloving

whom 
Unjust

Vile

Why 
do 
you 
even 
think 
in 
those 
terms 
As 
a 
charismatic 
you 
probably 
habitually 
break 
the 
rd 
commandment 
but 
don 
t 
you 
have 
any 
fear 
I 
am 
sorry 
but 
I 
never 
seen 
anything 
other 
that 
complete 
mindlessness 
It 
s 
embarrassing 
Unbelievers 
t 
be 
looking 
on 
people 
speaking 
in 
tongues 
and 
think 
you 
are 
out 
of 
your 
minds 
but 
that 
is 
the 
case 
of 
the 
time 
Paul 
was 
trying 
to 
curb 
the 
practice

Paul 
is 
by 
that 
line 
of 
reasoning 
It 
s 
blasphemous 
reasoning 
God

Look 
at 
the 
law 
humans 
cannot 
punish 
the 
son 
for 
the 
sins 
of 
the 
father 
but 
God 
has 
the 
authority 
to 
curse 
them 
for 
multiple 
generations

God

hearts

perfectly 
Creatures

really 
what 
language

talking 
Who 
is 
translating

Or 
maybe 
just 
maybe 
quite 
possibly 
it 
s 
all 
mindless 
self 
indulgence 
Talking 
gibberish 
and 
making 
false 
prophecies 
does 
not

God 
It 
s 
making

you 
and 
not 
Him 
I 
find 
it 
repulsive 
You 
continually 
imply 
that 
you 
don 
t 
get 
the 
hierarchy 
and 
the 
unbridgeable 
distinction 
between 
creator 
and 
creature 
A 
lot 
of 
your 
inability 
to 
get 
what 
is 
being 
said 
stems 
from 
that 
Is 
that 
from 
the 
charismatic 
tendency 
to 
sometimes 
see

The 
Apostle 
Paul

talking 
about

When 
I 
was 
a

I 
spoke

I 
thought

I 
reasoned 
like

When 
I 
became 
a 
man 
I 
gave 
up 
childish 
ways 
Will

What

All 
I 
know 
is 
he 
hates 
Reformed 
theology 
with 
a 
passion 
And 
if 
maple 
t 
allowed 
into 
the 
Kingdom 
it 
t 
be 
unjust 
for 
God 
to 
prohibit 
both 
the 
sapling 
and 
tree 
from 
the 
Kingdom 
If 
He 
wanted 
to 
show 
mercy 
that 
s 
His 
prerogative 
but 
we 
have 
zero 
evidence 
that 
He 
distinguishes 
between 
the 
little 
wicked 
and 
big 
wicked 
Listen 
I 
know 
this 
is 
tough 
stuff 
but 
we 
re 
all 
mature 
here 
We 
should 
be 
beyond 
a 
diet 
of 
breast 
milk 
and 
baby 
food 
so 
let 
s 
talk 
like 
adults 
I 
bet 
Pol 
Pot 
was 
a 
pie 
too 
when 
he 
was 
a 
kid 
but 
a 
maple 
sapling 
still 
grows 
into 
a 
maple 
tree 
You 
mean 
the 
same 
type 
of 
pies 
that 
our 
God 
told 
Joshua 
to 
slay 
The 
fall 
resulted 
in 
alienation 
from 
God 
and 
the 
only 
way 
back 
is 
through 
entering 
into 
a 
covenant 
with 
YAHWEH 
not 
a 
baby 
dedication 
to 
or 
a 
covenant 
ritual 
with 
or 
Ra 
or 
God 
took 
the 
lives 
of 
a 
bunch 
of 
pagan 
firstborns 
dedicated 
to 
demons 
and 
as 
they 
grew 
up 
they 
became 
more 
and 
more 
like 
what 
they 
worshiped 
They 
were 
outside 
of 
the 
real 
covenant 
and 
so 
they 
received 
wrath 
but 
you 
think 
they 
were 
some 
innocent 
typological 
of 
Christs 
So 
God 
deals 
out 
the 
most 
explicit 
form 
of 
Divine 
possible 
on 
people 
in 
order 
to 
send 
them 
to 
heaven 
That 
sounds 
more 
like 
a 
religious 
sacrifice 
not 
Scripture 
is 
clear 
on 
Esau 
Answer 
my 
question 
So 
God 
kills 
the 
cute 
little 
Egyptian 
cuddle 
muffins 
for 
having 
Egyptian 
rather 
than 
Jewish 
parents 
in 
order 
to 
show 
mercy 
to 
His 
people 
then 
what 
happens 
You 
think 
God 
put 
the 
little 
pagans 
in 
heaven 
What 
if 
He 
t 
show 
them 
mercy 
in 
the 
afterlife 
Would 
that 
be 
okay 
Did 
the 
little 
cute 
Egyptian 
children 
have 
a 
choice 
in 
their 
parents 
Nope 
Nevertheless 
they 
were 
still 
killed 
and 
it 
was 
to 
show 
God 
s 
power 
and 
God 
s 
glory 
Are 
you 
really 
okay 
with 
that 
I 
suspect 
you 
don 
t 
like 
to 
think 
about 
it 
but 
that 
s 
our 
God 
who 
we 
worship 
as 
totally 
loving 
to 
His 
people 
and 
praise 
as 
totally 
just 
You 
need 
to 
grapple 
with 
what 
is 
your 
authority 
scripture 
including 
the 
stuff 
that 
gets 
raw 
or 
your 
own 
determinations 
Food 
for 
thought 
Keep 
in 
mind 
that 
God 
took 
the 
lives 
of 
tiny 
little 
cute 
Egyptian 
children 
saying 
goo 
goo 
Why 
Because 
their 
parents 
did 
not 
kill 
a 
lamb 
and 
paint 
their 
house 
with 
lamb 
s 
blood 
Does 
God 
have 
the 
authority 
to 
do 
that 
Can 
you 
judge 
God 
for 
that 
Are 
you 
sure 
about 
that 
You 
are 
bringing 
up 
the 
same 
arguments 
that 
unbelievers 
bring 
up 
when 
they 
charge 
God 
with 
being 
unjust 
and 
unloving 
How 
do 
you 
feel 
about 
the 
wiping 
out 
the 
Egyptian 
first 
born 
Is 
that 
loving 
and 
just 
in 
your 
view 
Who 
are 
you 
Who 
do 
you 
think 
you 
are 
By 
what 
authority 
do 
you 
bring 
a 
charge 
Three 
forms 
of 
unity 
is 
alright 
with 
me 
You 
seem 
to 
think 
doing 
bad 
stuff 
is

A 
person 
paralyzed 
from

down 
might 
not 
do 
anything 
but 
still 
be 
reprobate 
in 
his 
heart 
Wow 
there 
are 
a 
lot 
of 
atheists 
straying 
from 
the 
agreed 
upon 
script 
In 
case 
you 
forgot 
the 
script 
is 
We 
t 
suppressing 
the 
truth 
We 
don 
t 
hate 
God 
How 
can 
we 
hate 
something 
that 
does 
not 
exist 
Not 
I 
hate 
God 
so 
I 
ll 
pretend 
He 
t 
exist 
I 
was 
raised 
by 
atheists 
so 
I 
have 
a 
conversion 
experience 
but 
I 
know 
many 
people 
who 
were 
raised 
by 
Godly 
who 
never 
had 
a 
conversion 
experience 
They 
simply 
grew 
and 
deepened 
in 
their 
faith 
and 
understanding 
I 
was 
wondering 
the 
same 
thing 
It 
sounded 
almost 
like 
part 
of 
the 
argument 
against 
infant 
baptism 
is 
that 
it 
deprives 
the 
person 
of 
a 
precious 
experience 
and 
the 
experience 
is 
paramount 
If 
that 
s 
the 
case 
then 
nobody 
should 
get 
baptized 
as 
long 
as 
they 
live 
under 
the 
roof 
their 
parents 
because 
parents 
have 
legitimate 
authority 
over 
children 
and 
children 
must 
honor 
their 
parents 
In 
order 
to 
avoid 
any 
confusion 
wait 
until 
marriage 
to 
get 
baptized 
I 
understand 
that 
the 
experience 
of 
applying 
for 
citizenship 
studying 
for 
citizenship 
and 
finally 
receiving 
citizenship 
is 
probably 
pretty 
cool 
but 
if 
your 
parents 
are 
already 
citizens 
and 
they 
raise 
you 
to 
be 
a 
citizen 
I 
don 
t 
see 
the 
point 
of 
hoop 
jumping 
for 
an 
experience

they

You

to 
the

Well 
you

argument

sociological 
terms 
that 
ignore 
theological 
distinctions

it

if 
your 
goal 
is 
to 
actually 
understand 
the 
motivations 
for 
why 
people 
do 
what 
they 
do 
The 
Westminster 
Confession 
of 
Faith 
is 
a 
go 
to 
source 
for 
Calvinist 
doctrine 
You

people 
who

this 
stuff

you 
sound 
like 
someone 
who

Evangelical 
is 
a 
distinct 
category 
from 
the 
confessionally 
reformed 
One 
is 
not 
a 
subset 
of 
another 
Evangelicals 
don 
t 
generally 
believe 
in 
total 
depravity 
I 
d 
guess 
they 
voted 
the 
way 
they 
did 
because 
one 
candidate 
reached 
out 
to 
them 
and 
the 
other 
did 
the 
opposite

Okay 
I 
read 
it 
and 
my 
hot 
take 
is 
that 
the 
author 
is 
puffed 
up 
in 
his 
self 
inflicted 
ignorance 
Scripture 
assumes 
that 
the 
reader 
will 
notice 
the 
symbolism 
It 
practically 
jumps 
off 
the 
page 
Don 
t 
be 
scared 
of 
it 
so 
how 
do 
you 
get 
access 
to 
the 
blood 
in 
a 
non 
symbolic 
way 
you 
seem 
to 
think 
symbolic 
is 
inferior 
I 
disagree 
Spiritual 
info 
is 
best 
explained 
via 
symbols 
So 
you 
think 
it 
would 
look 
different 
under 
a 
microscope 
if 
I 
agreed 
with 
you 
I 
would 
focus 
on 
hunting 
for 
Jesus 
relics 
he 
was 
fully 
human 
in 
his 
concrete 
body 
But 
you 
do 
not 
have 
access 
to 
his 
concrete 
plasma 
from 
a 
Jesus 
blood 
bank 
The 
symbolism 
is 
bigger 
Lamb 
blood 
did 
not 
forgive 
sin 
via 
magic 
It 
was 
symbolic 
in 
that 
it 
foreshadowed 
Christ 
s 
death 
Jesus 
cursing 
the 
fig 
tree 
would 
be 
pointless 
outside 
the 
symbolism 
Symbolism 
is 
never 
mere 
symbolism 
Symbols 
are 
bigger 
than 
the 
concrete 
Jesus 
had 
human 
blood 
Please 
learn 
about 
symbolism 
It 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
aspects 
for 
understanding 
our 
faith 
This 
fundamentalist 
anti 
intellectualism 
confuses 
people 
into 
superficiality 
God 
is 
communicating 
great 
mysteries 
to 
us 
through 
the 
richness 
of 
His 
symbols 
Do 
you 
drink 
real 
blood 
at 
the 
Lord 
s 
supper 
I 
don 
t 
even 
know 
what 
you 
want 
to 
debate 
What 
s 
your 
position 
That 
blood 
t 
symbolize 
anything 
in 
the 
Bible 
If 
that 
is 
your 
position 
I 
m 
sorry 
but 
that 
is 
completely 
absurd 
Well 
please 
don

comments 
about 
being

head 
might

If 
you 
can 
t 
identify 
symbolism 
then 
you 
need 
stop 
whatever 
it 
is 
you 
are 
doing 
and 
learn 
how 
symbolism 
works 
Do 
not 
pick 
up 
your

until 
you 
understand 
symbolism 
The

all 
reject

idea 
that

don

think 
they

the

ring 
about

sections 
to

divide

What 
I 
said 
would 
be 
deeply 
offensive 
to 
them

has 
been 
sneaky 
about 
it 
He 
also 
claims 
Cornelius 
Van 
and 
John 
Calvin 
He 
dresses 
himself 
up 
with 
the 
most 
orthodox 
bibliography 
and 
proceeds 
to 
trample 
all 
over 
it 
with 
secular 
presuppositions 
It

just

It 
s

Yes 
Historically 
that 
has 
generally 
been 
the 
case 
The 
Reference 
Bible 
was 
the 
jam 
of 
the 
early 
Fundamentalist 
movement

thought 
helped

justify 
losing

dropping 
out 
of 
culture

invented

South 
Africa 
They 
t 
Oh 
and 
when 
the 
Marxist 
says 
their 
opponents 
have 
a 
truncating 
Gospel 
I 
interpret 
that 
as 
a 
sneaky 
way 
of 
likening 
us 
to 
who 
have 
literally 
truncated 
the

It 
s 
not 
a 
compliment 
And 
because 
they 
don

know 
how 
to

believe 
that 
the

is 
this 
surprising 
Yes 
He 
was 
raised 
pagan 
and 
embraced 
all 
the 
pagan 
philosophies 
about 
Free 
Will 
and 
he 
probably 
never 
read 
the 
entire

do 
you 
expect 
The 
Sadducee 
rejected 
scripture 
and 
the 
supernatural 
and 
believed 
in 
Free 
Will 
They 
were 
heretics 
No 
orthodox 
worshiper 
of 
Yahweh 
at 
the 
time 
of 
Jesus 
believed 
in 
Free 
Will 
They 
all 
believed 
in 
Divine 
Providence 
Pagans 
believed 
in 
fate 
and 
then 
they 
started 
calling 
it 
superstitious 
so 
they 
started 
playing 
with 
the 
pagan 
idea 
of 
Free 
Will 
People 
like 
Clement 
picked 
that 
up 
from 
them 
It 
s 
not 
from

that 
people

they

You 
do 
what 
you 
are 
You 
don 
t 
make

Clement 
is 
not 
thinking 
clearly 
Read 
the 
context 
He 
clearly 
got 
sucked 
into 
Greek 
philosophical 
discussions 
e 
g 
the 
writings 
of 
Socrates 
and 
he 
unwittingly 
accepted 
their 
presuppositions 
and 
categories 
to 
create 
an 
argument 
that 
is 
untethered 
by 
scripture 
If 
you 
want 
to 
expand 
i 
e 
redefine 
the 
definition 
of 
fate 
to 
include 
a 
monotheist 
conception 
of 
Divine 
Providence 
acting 
in 
human 
history 
then 
yes 
I 
will 
reject 
that 
attempt

this

So 
if 
we 
throw 
out 
the 
Bible 
and 
the 
imperatives 
that 
we 
derive 
from 
the 
Bible 
which 
become 
our 
preferences 
we 
are 
left 
with 
what 
Following 
as 
our 
guru 
Let 
s 
back 
up 
a 
second 
Look 
at 
what 
has 
preceded 
this 
moment 
Most 
of 
the 
people 
coming 
at 
me 
are 
not 
saying 
hey 
I 
m 
a 
Christian 
They 
are 
saying 
Christianity 
is 
an 
oppressive 
fairy 
tale 
and 
people 
need 
to 
became 
liberated 
by 
apostatizing 
You 
have 
misread 
me 
I 
said 
people 
who 
lack 
in 
faith 
tend 
to 
apostatize 
If 
they 
apostatize 
then 
they 
become 
apostates 
If 
that 
t 
describe 
you 
then 
I 
m 
not 
talking 
about 
you 
I 
agree 
that 
calling 
a 
person 
an 
apostate 
when 
they 
are 
not 
is 
wrong 
Who 
have 
I 
wrongly 
accused 
Those 
are 
some 
pretty 
harsh 
words 
I 
m 
in 
the 
and 
the 
people 
in 
my 
fellowship 
would 
be 
appalled 
at 
breaking 
the 
first 
three 
commandments 
and 
they 
d 
want 
to 
know 
how 
that 
could 
be 
a 
martyr 
of 
the 
mute 
button 
Calling 
someone 
an 
apostate 
is 
not 
like 
calling 
someone 
a 
head 
It 
s 
a 
spiritually 
clinical 
term 
that 
many 
of 
the 
people 
coming 
at 
me 
wholeheartedly 
embrace 
It 
s 
not 
meant 
to 
be 
offensive 
and 
I 
m 
not 
bullying 
I 
think 
apostates 
should 
apostatize 
instead 
of 
Mute 
me 
That 
would 
be 
symbolically 
pregnant 
with 
meaning 
There 
s 
no 
problem 
In 
order 
to 
avoid 
such 
misunderstandings 
in 
other 
encounters 
you 
should 
be 
aware 
that 
touching 
a 
raw 
nerve 
is 
a 
colloquialism 
that 
should 
not 
be 
taken 
formally 
or 
in 
a 
wooden 
literal 
sense 
I 
m 
not 
arguing 
with 
you 
guys 
I 
made 
my 
point 
and 
everyone 
came 
at 
me 
so 
now

m

fun

If

take

as

there 
is 
a 
profound 
inconsistency 
If 
you 
take

then 
there 
is 
no 
contradiction 
You 
can

then 
that 
means 
you 
see

as

Do 
you 
understand

concept

That 
s 
about 
the 
Genesis 
creation 
account 
That 
s 
a 
particular 
form 
of 
literature 
that 
t 
under 
discussion 
We 
are 
talking 
about 
the 
law 
Nobody 
would 
tell 
a 
police 
officer 
that

only

sorts 
of 
invisible 
loopholes 
and 
the

does 
not 
either 
the 
invisible 
loopholes 
are 
bogus 
or 
we 
are 
just 
bigots 
against 
bestiality 
for 
no 
real 
reason 
other 
than 
we 
personally 
think 
it 
is 
gross 
and 
we 
are 
more 
comfortable 
being 
inconsistent 
on 
that 
issue 
It 
was 
intended 
as 
a 
comparison 
It 
was 
intended 
as 
a 
method 
of 
interpretation 
Okay 
so 
you 
would 
say 
that 
according 
to 
the 
verse 
the 
feelings 
t 
explicitly 
condemned 
but 
the 
action 
is 
I 
mean 
it 
s 
pretty 
clear 
and 
that 
s 
not 
even 
about 
abusing 
the 
animal 
It 
s 
to 
avoid 
making 
yourself 
unclean 
with 
it 
the 
animal 
So 
even 
if 
the 
well 
being 
of 
the 
animal 
was 
not 
a 
consideration 
it 
would 
still 
be 
wrong 
Just 
imagine 
for 
a 
second 
that 
someone 
really 
liked 
bestiality 
and 
wanted 
to 
argue 
that 
it 
was 
about 
abuse 
and 
they 
were 
only 
laying 
with 
dead 
animals 
and 
there 
is 
no 
command 
against 
that 
Would 
that 
fly 
as 
a 
proper 
interpretation 
application 
Interesting 
but 
I 
will 
ask 
again 
If 
the 
phrase 
was 
you 
shall 
not 
lie 
with 
an 
animal 
as 
with 
a 
woman 
is 
this 
not 
necessarily 
about 
bestiality 
I 
m 
humoring 
you 
Okay 
this 
is 
an 
incredibly 
specific 
command 
Now 
let 
s 
see 
if 
maybe 
there 
are 
some 
exceptions 
to 
the 
rule 
elsewhere 
in 
scripture 
Okay 
there 
s 
none 
let 
s 
look 
at 
other 
less 
clear 
verses 
and 
see 
if 
they 
support 
or 
complicate 
matters 
Well 
it 
s 
consistent 
a 
woman 
meaning 
female 
human 
it 
referring 
to 
the 
action 
just 
described 
is 
meaning 
equals 
an 
abomination 
meaning 
a 
special 
form 
of 
repulsive 
sin 
I 
am 
the 
Lord 
Means 
the 
speaker 
is 
declaring 
His 
Divinity 
and

You 
meaning 
human 
males 
shall 
not 
an 
explicit 
negative 
command 
lie 
meaning 
sexual 
relations 
with 
meaning 
accompanying 
a 
male 
meaning 
human 
male 
as 
with 
meaning 
in 
the 
same 
manner 
as 
It 
s 
not 
up 
for 
debate 
God 
said 
it 
The 
case 
is 
closed 
In 
other 
words 
nothing 
will 
convince 
you 
and 
you 
ll 
find 
a 
way 
to 
wiggle 
out 
of 
everything 
by 
pointing 
to 
one 
source 
that 
simply 
expanded 
the 
definition 
to 
include 
certain 
heterosexual 
stuff 
and 
pretend 
that 
it 
changes 
everything

you

with 
evidence 
of 
execution 
of 
two 
male 
lovers 
in 
which 
no 
rape 
was 
alleged 
Not 
at 
all 
I 
want 
them 
in 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
God 
but 
that 
will 
not 
be 
their 
fate 
if 
they 
keep 
on 
the 
of 
sin 
If 
the 
phrase 
was 
you 
shall 
not 
lie 
with 
an 
animal 
as 
with 
a 
woman 
is 
this 
not 
necessarily 
about 
bestiality 
Yes 
it 
does 
match 
What 
does 
the 
history 
of 
the 
saints 
show 
about 
those 
caught 
who 
lie 
with 
a 
male 
as 
with 
a 
woman 
Did 
they 
give 
them 
the 
keys 
to 
the 
city 
Or 
did 
something 
much 
messier 
happen 
I 
am 
the 
Lord 
You 
shall 
not 
lie 
with 
a 
male 
as 
with 
a 
woman 
it 
is 
an 
abomination 
This 
is

that 
How 
could 
it 
be 
any 
clearer 
How 
I 
raised 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
myth 
of 
neutrality 
because 
you 
embrace 
it 
axiomatically 
It 
was 
a 
rhetorical 
question 
that 
was 
making 
a 
parody 
of 
you 
saying 
it 
is 
somehow 
up 
for 
debate 
I 
should 
have 
brought 
it 
up 
before 
but 
this 
picture 
is 
essentially 
the 
position 
you 
taken 
with 
regards 
to 
stuff 
in 
the 
Bible 
We 
figured 
it 
out 
after 
thousands 
of 
years

Lord 
You 
shall

as 
with 
a

it

How 
is 
this 
open 
for 
debate 
If 
you 
don 
t 
like 
it 
you 
might 
have 
your 
catered 
to 
more 
in 
another 
religion 
No 
I 
am 
actively 
mocking 
you 
and 
your 
delusion 
of 
neutrality 
Okay 
I 
m 
going 
to 
assume 
you 
don 
t 
know 
the 
Biblical 
languages 
and 
give 
you 
a 
very 
respected 
translation 
from 
the 
Word 
of 
God 
I 
am 
the 
Lord 
You 
shall 
not 
lie 
with 
a 
male 
as 
with 
a 
woman 
it 
is 
an 
abomination 
How 
do 
you 
interpret 
that 
Atheists 
t 
good 
at 
reading 
the 
Bible 
Take 
a 
deep 
breath 
and 
try 
again 
It 
s 
the 
words 
on 
the 
page 
It 
s 
the 
words 
in 
the 
Torah 
It 
s 
the 
words 
in 
the 
Prophets 
It 
s 
the 
words 
in 
the 
Writings 
It 
s 
words 
in 
the 
NT 
They 
t 
affirming 
In 
fact 
they 
are 
explicitly 
hostile 
to 
advancing 
that 
pagan 
agenda 
You 
re 
gonna 
have 
to 
do 
something 
more 
Well 
let 
me 
ask 
people 
and 
we 
can 
have 
a 
scientific 
study 
ready 
for 
the 
press 
And 
yet 
the 
scientific 
community 
published 
it 
and 
shared 
to 
everyone 
as 
if 
t 
simple 
god 
haters 
masking 
their 
agenda 
behind 
science 
This 
is 
the 
world 
we 
live 
in 
It 
is 
not 
neutral 
Ask 
Lawrence 
The 
God 
that 
always 
existed 
and 
was 
not 
created 
by 
god 
A 
mating 
with 
god 
B 
to 
create 
god 
C 
God 
is 
eternal 
Nothing 
existed 
before 
Him 
There 
s 
one 
God 
Oh 
well 
in 
that 
case 
let 
s 
just 
burn 
the 
Bible 
as 
a 
hate 
crime 
or 
go 
through 
and 
edit 
it 
all 
out 
because 
people 
who 
are 
rebelling 
against 
themselves 
are 
hurting 
themselves 
Nope 
They 
need 
God 
s 
word 
so 
I 
point 
out 
as 
a 
critique 
how 
we 
live 
in 
a 
culture 
that 
thinks 
it 
is 
perpetually 
oppressed 
and 
you 
attribute 
the 
view 
I 
critiqued 
to 
me 
I 
m 
talking 
about 
this 
scholarship 
that 
says 
there 
s 
nothing 
against 
being 
gay 
in 
the 
Bible 
because 
words 
are 
confusing 
and 
it 
s 
a 
conspiracy 
against 
us 
You 
buy 
into 
this 
myth 
of 
neutrality 
Did 
you 
know 
I 
saw 
an 
article 
recently 
where 
scientists 
have 
proven 
to 
their 
own 
satisfaction 
that 
everyone 
who 
believes 
in 
a 
higher 
power 
suffers 
from 
a 
mental 
condition 
Do 
you 
not 
see 
what 
s 
happening 
or 
are 
you 
gonna 
call 
a 
doctor 
it 
s 
Everyone 
with 
a 
flat 
screen 
thinks 
they 
re 
oppressed 
because 
their 
neighbor 
has 
a 
bigger 
one 
so 
now 
we 
re 
calling 
envy 
and 
covetousness 
a 
fight 
for 
justice 
Give 
me 
a 
break 
You 
got 
the 
wrong 
categories 
it 
does 
match 
perfectly 
This 
t 
some 
mystery 
The 
sexual 
revolution 
happened 
and 
people 
wanted 
to 
start 
being 
slick 
in 
the 
scholarship 
It 
s 
not 
neutral 
It 
s 
agenda 
driven 
Neutrality 
is 
a 
myth 
That 
guy 
is 
a 
joke 
He 
s 
an 
atheist 
communist 
who 
is 
all 
about 
destroying 
Israel 
and 
he 
just 
so 
happened 
to 
write 
that 
garbage 
you 
presented 
to 
me 
as 
reputable 
You 
and 
him 
are 
speaking 
the 
same 
language 
We 
t 
You 
know 
God 
exists 
but 
you 
habitually 
suppress 
that 
truth 
because 
you 
like 
your 
unrighteousness 
God 
s 
existence 
t 
up 
for 
debate 
God 
is 
axiomatic 
God 
defines 
sin 
God 
defines 
homosexual 
activity 
as 
a 
tier 
one 
level 
sin 
i 
e 
an 
abomination 
People 
engaging 
in 
that 
need 
to 
repent 
for 
all 
their 
sins 
and 
get 
right 
with 
God 
God 
s 
standards 
repel 
you 
God 
hating 
secularists 
at 
war 
with 
God 
s 
standards 
draw 
you 
in 
like 
a 
moth 
to 
a 
flame 
You 
and 
I 
are 
on 
different 
teams 
You 
re 
if 
you 
even 
do 
that 
every 
now 
and 
then 
But 
you 
don 
t 
do 
that 
too 
Here 
s 
the 
distinction 
You 
base 
you 
limitations 
on 
whatever 
is 
the 
fad 
among 
the 
Marxists 
and 
I 
set 
the 
limits 
based 
on 
God 
s 
standards 
Why 
are 
you 
so 
drawn 
to 
these 
God 
haters 
and 
repelled 
by 
those 
who 
should 
be 
your 
brothers 
and 
sisters 
in 
Christ 
It 
definitely 
shows 
your 
allegiances 
Again 
You 
say 
something 
heretical 
based 
on 
external 
secular 
sources 
hostile 
to 
God 
I 
point 
it 
out 
You 
change 
the 
subject 
God 
exists 
He 
has 
spoken 
in 
history 
He 
has 
instructed 
His 
people 
to 
call 
everyone 
to 
repent 
of 
their 
sins 
and 
get 
right 
with 
Him 
I 
agree 
there 
a 
lot 
of 
traditions 
and 
flavors 
and 
styles 
that 
can 
all 
be 
filed 
under 
historic 
Christianity 
They 
are 
brothers 
and 
sisters 
I 
don 
t 
think 
anyone 
has 
a 
perfect 
theology 
in 
this 
life 
However 
there 
are 
basic 
standards 
that 
seem 
allergic 
to 
you 
WOW 
Do 
you 
have 
any 
more 
atheist 
Marxists 
with 
an 
to 
grind 
against 
God 
to 
tell 
me 
about 
theology 
What 
more 
do 
you 
want 
You 
say 
some 
heretical 
comment 
based 
solely 
from 
an 
external 
secular 
hostile 
to 
historic 
Christianity 
then 
I 
point 
that 
out 
and 
then 
you 
change 
the 
subject 
That 
s 
been 
the 
back 
and 
forth 
Sin 
is 
harmful 
Wow 
you 
found 
an 
odd 
duck 
with 
a 
taste 
for 
German 
I 
don 
t 
know 
his 
deal 
Don 
t 
get 
me 
started 
on 
those 
are 
the 
bell 
bottoms 
that 
keep 
coming 
back 
whenever 
people 
don 
t 
like 
the 
law 
German 
atheists 
thinking 
German 
atheist 
thoughts 
and 
writing 
them 
down 
It 
s 
entirely 
speculative 
That 
s 
not 
how 
it 
looks 
to 
me 
You 
re 
just 
some 
fad 
jumper 
hopping 
on 
the 
latest 
atheistic 
progressive 
ad 
campaign 
You 
like 
their 
trendy 
movement 
and 
you 
toss 
out 
God 
to 
be 
seen 
as 
hip 
to 
it 
It 
s 
capitulation 
So 
you 
equate 
supporting 
some 
completely 
social 
practices 
with 
opposition 
to 
some 
completely 
social 
movements 
This 
t 
about 
petty 
political 
movements 
In 
the 
US 
we 
have 
the 
choice 
of 
a 
party 
of 
atheistic 
Marxians 
or 
atheistic 
Ayn 
I 
did 
not 
realize 
that 
because 
it 
is 
entirely 
unfounded 
speculation 
on 
your 
part 
I 
don 
t 
see 
the 
need 
to 
boast 
of 
my 
Kingdom 
activities 
I 
live 
in 
pretty 
poor 
area 
of 
the 
city 
There 
s 
a 
lot 
of 
work 
being 
done 
and 
more 
needs 
to 
be 
done 
but 
that 
s 
not 
the 
issue 
under 
discussion 
Says 
who 
I 
don 
t 
think 
it 
bodes 
well 
for 
the 
pretending 
to 
be 
Christians 
but 
are 
actually 
promoting 
abominations 
In 
the 
past 
they 
would 
say 
I 
got 
a 
revelation 
from 
an 
angel 
but 
now 
they 
say 
I 
got 
a 
revelation 
from 
pagan 
social 
scientists 
It 
s 
all 
in 
the 
open 
I 
m 
talking 
about 
the 
composition 
I 
am 
not 
talking 
about 
snapping 
a 
finger 
into 
utopia 
I 
am 
a 
so 
I 
believe 
Jesus 
will 
put 
his 
enemies 
under 
his 
feet 
including 
the 
promoting 
lawlessness 
as 
Godliness 
Dude 
you 
are 
so 
impressionable 
You 
hop 
on 
what 
are 
equivalents 
of 
intellectual 
bell 
bottoms 
little 
mind 
fads 
the 
latest 
idea 
fashions 
every 
blog 
and 
magazine 
is 
talking 
about 
Whatever 
you 
think 
you 
hold 
on 
to 
today 
could 
be 
one 
campaign 
away 
from 
horrific 
to 
you 
the 
next 
day 
I 
am 
not 
asking 
myself 
I 
have 
been 
asking 
you 
directly 
for 
some 
time 
now 
You 
operate 
under 
the 
same 
presuppositions 
as 
the 
scholars 
You 
eat 
up 
their 
material 
because 
you 
see 
it 
as 
a 
neutral 
when 
it 
is 
in 
fact 
heavily 
invested 
with 
presuppositions 
about 
the 
impossibility 
of 
a 
Sovereign 
God 
You 
seem 
very 
easily 
swayed 
by 
all 
the 
wrong 
types 
If 
you 
reject 
what 
I 
said 
then 
there 
is 
no 
way 
the 
Mosaic 
literature 
could 
predate 
the 
Babylonian 
period 
because 
how 
could 
Moses 
have 
known 
or 
guessed 
correctly 
about 
future 
events 
It 
s 
impossible 
in 
world 
that 
is 
assumed 
to 
be 
without 
a 
Sovereign 
God 
This 
means 
that 
prophecy 
is 
not 
post 
facto 
pretending 
to 
be 
before 
the 
fact 
nor 
is 
prophecy 
just 
a 
lucky 
guess 
coincidence 
Prophecy 
is 
a 
direct 
sign 
from 
a 
Sovereign 
God 
of 
the 
universe 
of 
His 
authority 
Here 
s 
where 
I 
m 
coming 
from 
God 
is 
sovereign 
over 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
universe 
and 
diachronic 
history 
Since 
God 
is 
triune 
He 
is 
able 
to 
do 
something 
more 
than 
lecture 
from 
up 
high 
down 
to 
a 
stenographer 
The 
Spirit 
of 
God 
can 
indwell 
in 
a 
writer 
and 
guide 
them 
perfectly 
You 
want 
to 
be 
loved 
by 
the 
pagans 
It 
won 
t 
happen 
It 
s 
just 
capitulation 
Your 
would 
be 
a 
subset 
of 
It 
s 
atheist 
hermeneutics 
It 
t 
lend 
credibility 
to 
my 
claim 
ACCORDING 
to 
you 
because 
you 
already 
rejected 
the 
most 
basic 
presuppositions 
of 
Christianity 
You 
re 
wandering 
without 
a 
tether 
being 
tossed 
around 
by 
new 
studies 
from 
our 
haters 
They 
done 
a 
bang 
up 
job 
with 
you 
You 
capitulated 
You 
don 
t 
get 
it 
Since 
Moses 
predicted 
the 
Babylonian 
captivity 
we 
d 
have 
have 
to 
either 
assume 
that 
either 
God 
exists 
and 
knows 
the 
future 
or 
reject 
God 
and 
insist 
that 
they 
are 
forgeries 
written 
after 
the 
events 
took 
place 
to 
appear 
prophetic 
Which 
sounds 
godless 
Why 
not 
just 
apostatize 
instead 
of 
continuing 
what 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
charade 
Agree 
Agree 
Disagree 
Your 
method 
of 
the 
text 
into 
your 
own 
image 
would 
require 
an 
utter 
lack 
of 
clarity 
You 
can 
t 
be 
surprised 
that 
it 
strikes 
others 
as 
a 
highly 
selective 
tendency 
to 
play 
confused 
when 
it 
suites 
your 
needs 
What 
s 
your 
deal 
then 
Why 
do 
you 
even 
bother 
identifying 
yourself 
with 
something 
that 
you 
obviously 
see 
as 
nothing 
more 
than 
a 
Rorschach 
Test 
with 
no 
real 
there 
to 
be 
found 
other 
than 
our 
own 
narcissistic 
desires 
Ah 
so 
the 
text 
is 
simply 
a 
reflection 
of 
ourselves 
Death 
of 
the 
Author 
Death 
of 
God 
Solid 
depravity 
Is 
there 
no 
limit 
to 
your 
capitulation 
That 
s 
the 
theory 
of 
the 
radical 
godless 
skeptics 
and 
they 
do 
so 
on 
the 
basis 
that 
prophecy 
would 
require 
the 
supernatural 
and 
since 
the 
supernatural 
t 
exist 
the 
text 
must 
have 
been 
written 
after 
the 
events 
of 
the 
prophecy 
you 
think 
Leviticus 
was 
written 
almost 
a 
thousand 
years 
after 
Moses 
died 
If 
you 
thought 
I 
implied 
it 
then 
I 
am 
voicing 
my 
objection 
to 
your 
interpretation 
Did 
I 
say 
that 
Nope 
Yes 
there 
s 
a 
lot 
of 
rape 
in 
the 
animal 
world 
However 
they 
know 
they 
gotta 
reproduce 
and 
that 
reproducing 
is 
awesome 
If 
every 
panda 
embraced 
their 
natural 
and 
normal 
self 
as 
you 
see 
it 
then 
there 
would 
be 
no 
more 
pandas 
Are 
you 
a 
Unitarian 
Much 
more 
than 
that 
His 
view 
of 
scripture 
was 
mountains 
higher 
than 
the 
position 
you 
laid 
out 
for 
yourself 
So 
it 
is 
your 
position 
that 
scripture 
is 
just 
a 
collection 
of 
people 
philosophizing 
about 
their 
conception 
of 
God 
and 
divine 
inspiration 
t 
exist 
by 
way 
of 
the 
Holy 
Spirit 
If 
they 
are 
wired 
for 
that 
why 
did 
Moses 
persecute 
them 
so 
hard 
Obviously 
God 
t 
tell 
him 
to 
call 
them 
abominations 
and 
call 
for 
their 
death 
so 
obviously 
Moses 
must 
have 
been 
hearing 
voices 
in 
his 
head 
Whose 
mistakes 
Paul 
s 
Jesus 
Moses 
Who 
should 
I 
learn 
from 
Darwin 
I 
don 
t 
think 
you 
understand 
what 
I 
mean 
about 
God 
s 
timeless 
law 
Jesus 
thought 
of 
the 
scripture 
as 
inerrant 
but 
that 
was 
silly 
right 
Where 
s 
the 
line 
And 
therefore 
that 
means 
what 
so 
God 
s 
law 
evolves 
along 
with 
the 
atheist 
morality 
and 
knowledge 
and 
it 
is 
just 
an 
illusion 
that 
you 
completely 
capitulated 
to 
the 
godless 
culture 
No 
doubt 
they 
haven 
t 
shown 
that 
But 
what 
if 
they 
did 
You 
capitulated 
to 
them 
thus 
far 
where 
s 
the 
line 
So 
your 
point 
is 
what 
exactly 
I 
m 
asking 
about 
God 
s 
law 
God 
s 
law 
says 
having 
sex 
with 
animals 
is 
unlawful 
Can 
science 
abrogate 
that 
law 
you 
are 
too 
much 
You 
re 
twisting 
my 
words 
I 
m 
trying 
to 
keep 
this 
PG 
dude 
I 
m 
not 
sure 
we 
re 
talking 
about 
the 
same 
thing 
What 
on 
earth 
are 
you 
talking 
about 
It 
was 
a 
simple 
question 
and 
you 
responded 
with 
something 
completely 
out 
of 
left 
field 
to 
change 
the 
subject 
They 
overthrew 
God 
s 
timeless 
law 
I 
am 
married 
If 
it 
was 
about 
chasing 
pleasure 
then 
that 
s 
just 
hedonism 
Sex 
is 
a 
beautiful 
gift 
designed 
for 
a 
certain 
context 
Suicides 
is 
a 
sin 
People 
who 
are 
the 
biggest 
rebels 
against 
God 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
commit 
it 
It 
s 
not 
a 
coincidence 
It 
ll 
be 
a 
great 
day 
However 
while 
I 
on 
earth 
the 
order 
is 
to 
be 
fruitful 
and 
multiply 
in 
the 
way 
God 
designed 
us 
That 
s 
location 
of 
sex 
within 
that 
proper 
institution 
It 
s 
not 
about 
loving 
pleasure 
That 
just 
avoided 
my 
question 
I 
ll 
ask 
again 
Can 
anti 
Christian 
scientists 
hide 
behind 
their 
degrees 
and 
legitimately 
overthrow 
God 
s 
timeless 
law 
King 
Saul 
rebelled 
against 
God 
and 
committed 
suicide 
Judas 
rebelled 
against 
God 
and 
he 
committed 
suicide 
Pilate 
rebelled 
against 
God 
and 
he 
committed 
suicide 
The 
Jewish 
zealots 
rebelled 
against 
God 
and 
persecuted 
God 
s 
people 
and 
they 
committed 
mass 
suicide 
Should 
I 
be 
upset 
I 
t 
say 
that 
Men 
are 
born 
sinful 
You 
don 
t 
think 
Jesus 
had 
a 
problem 
with 
sinfulness 
Jesus 
gave 
the 
law 
to 
Moses 
so 
pagan 
medicine 
can 
overthrow 
God 
s 
timeless 
law 
Is 
that 
how 
things 
work 
It 
is 
in 
the 
NT 
Jesus 
resurrection 
t 
abolish 
chromosome 
configurations 
of 
male 
and 
female 
It 
did 
not 
abolish 
gender 
roles 
in 
society 
It 
t 
allow 
one 
to 
will 
oneself 
out 
of 
the 
God 
given 
body 
Nothing 
changes 
I 
don 
t 
know 
if 
the 
law 
addresses 
hermaphrodites 
I 
would 
assume 
they 
would 
be 
considered 
not 
marriage 
material 
by 
the 
wider 
society 
without 
Moses 
having 
to 
say 
a 
thing 
and 
that 
could 
account 
for 
not 
addressing 
it 
But 
wait 
The 
people 
who 
are 
trans 
don 
t 
like 
the 
law 
saying 
that 
They 
don 
t 
like 
it 
in 
the 
NT 
They 
say 
it 
is 
unloving 
They 
say 
it 
is 
denying 
their 
humanity 
They 
say 
it 
causes 
suicide 
Can 
t 
we 
rewrite 
the 
Law 
of 
God 
so 
we 
t 
bigots 
Nope 
Being 
trans 
is 
forbidden 
by 
the 
Law 
of 
God 
established 
in 
the 
Torah 
and 
continued 
into 
the 
New 
Covenant 
If 
you 
mean 
a 
hermaphrodite 
nobody 
thinks 
that 
s 
sinful 
Trans 
is 
another 
example 
of 
rebelling 
against 
God 
s 
natural 
order 
You 
misunderstand 
me 
I 
don 
t 
lay 
with 
my 
wife 
when 
she 
s 
menstruating 
That 
s 
weird 
Do 
I 
believe 
God 
s 
standards 
clearly 
prohibit 
sin 
YES 
EMPHATICALLY 
YES 
A 
THOUSAND 
TIMES 
YES 
Wait 
wait 
wait 
but 
does 
that 
apply 
if 
the 
person 
who 
sins 
will 
likely 
feel 
unhappy 
about 
it 
being 
called 
a 
sin 
and 
maybe 
even 
suicidal 
Nothing 
changes 
What 
are 
you 
talking 
about 
You 
shall 
not 
approach 
a 
woman 
to 
uncover 
her 
nakedness 
while 
she 
is 
in 
her 
menstrual 
uncleanness 
You 
act 
like 
this 
is 
some 
weird 
command 
Is 
this 
really 
a 
thing 
people 
do 
On 
what 
grounds 
How 
about 
God 
s 
Standards 
What 
Christian 
talks 
like 
this 
No 
He 
called 
them 
back 
to 
proper 
obedience 
to 
scripture 
that 
clashed 
with 
their 
fuzzy 
emotions 
above 
love 
law 
is 
if 
a 
married 
man 
died 
without 
children 
it 
was 
the 
duty 
of 
a 
brother 
or 
other 
near 
relative 
to 
marry 
the 
widow 
Absolutely 
I 
m 
showing 
you 
Paul 
s 
hermeneutics 
He 
looked 
at 
Lev 
and 
he 
looked 
at 
what 
was 
going 
on 
in 
Corinth 
and 
he 
put 
a 
stop 
to 
it 
even 
though 
the 
congregation 
thought 
it 
all 
love 
and 
a 
blessing 
They 
have 
the 
same 
problem 
as 
you 
apparently 
Listen 
It 
s 
all 
about 
the 
love 
right 
If 
they 
loved 
each 
other 
t 
they 
be 
fulfilling 
the 
law 
even 
if 
it 
went 
against 
Lev 
Paul 
did 
not 
see 
it 
that 
way 
He 
called 
it 
an 
abomination 
He 
called 
out 
the 
Church 
for 
celebrating 
it 
What 
else 
is 
in 
Lev 
Oh 
yeah 
sodomy 
Don 
t 
go 
conflating 
those 
two 
categories 
For 
starters 
Could 
you 
do 
me 
a 
favor 
and 
look 
up 
law 
to 
make 
sure 
you 
are 
talking 
about 
the 
same 
thing 
There 
s 
nothing 
criminal 
about 
the 
law 
but 
what 
about 
the 
love 
What 
about 
the 
stability 
What 
s 
wrong 
with 
that 
Paul 
t 
with 
you 
Nobody 
in 
scripture 
is 
with 
you 
You 
are 
with 
the 
world 
and 
you 
want 
their 
love 
Good 
luck 
with 
that 
It 
is 
actually 
reported 
that 
there 
is 
sexual 
immorality 
among 
you 
and 
of 
a 
kind 
that 
is 
not 
tolerated 
even 
among 
pagans 
for 
a 
man 
has 
his 
father 
s 
wife 
And 
you 
are 
arrogant 
Ought 
you 
not 
rather 
to 
mourn 
Let 
him 
who 
has 
done 
this 
be 
removed 
from 
among 
you 
Do 
I 
need 
to 
give 
a 
proof 
text 
barrage 
about 
Surely 
you 
know 
what 
the 
whole 
council 
of 
God 
bears 
witness 
to 
right 
It 
sounds 
like 
your 
questioning 
God 
s 
wisdom 
and 
challenging 
His 
Law 
Does 
worldly 
approval 
mean 
that 
much 
to 
you 
They 
did 
not 
need 
to 
spell 
out 
to 
the 
people 
that 
unlawful 
sexual 
relations 
that 
were 
called 
abominations 
can 
never 
be 
proper 
expressions 
of 
holy 
love 
It 
was 
axiomatic 
It 
was 
common 
sense 
It 
went 
without 
saying 
Here 
s 
what 
I 
done 
I 
shown 
the 
law 
that 
spells 
it 
out 
in 
unambiguous 
terms 
i 
e 
no 
exceptions 
I 
showed 
the 
continuation 
of 
the 
law 
into 
the 
New 
Covenant 
I 
showed 
that 
proper 
love 
is 
not 
lawless 
but 
in 
conformity 
to 
God 
s 
timeless 
law 
Are 
you 
messing 
with 
me 
Have 
you 
not 
read 
that 
He 
Who 
made 
them 
in 
the 
first 
place 
made 
them 
man 
and 
woman 
It 
says 
For 
this 
reason 
a 
man 
will 
leave 
his 
father 
and 
his 
mother 
and 
will 
live 
with 
his 
wife 
The 
two 
will 
become 
one 
So 
they 
are 
no 
longer 
two 
but 
one 
The 
saints 
believed 
that 
what 
you 
call 
love 
is 
an 
abomination 
You 
are 
just 
scared 
of 
the 
pagans 
thinking 
you 
re 
backwards 
idiot 
who 
believes 
in 
the 
sky 
daddy 
It 
seems 
you 
are 
super 
keen 
on 
getting 
their 
approval 
Exactly 
You 
seem 
to 
acknowledge 
that 
scripture 
makes 
distinctions 
about 
proper 
and 
improper 
love 
That 
was 
the 
point 
of 
the 
proof 
texts 
I 
wanted 
you 
to 
see 
that 
How 
are 
things 
deemed 
proper 
vs 
improper 
God 
s 
standards 
that 
are 
clearly 
spelled 
out 
in 
the 
law 
They 
don 
t 
have 
magisterial 
power 
and 
they 
ll 
be 
judged 
for 
acting 
outside 
of 
their 
position 
but 
that 
t 
make 
one 
the 
good 
guy 
and 
the 
other 
a 
bad 
guy 
That 
s 
what 
makes 
the 
claim 
of 
bandwagon 
accusation 
so 
amazing 
It 
s 
a 
bandwagon 
that 
has 
gone 
untouched 
for 
over 
a 
millennium 
You 
re 
jumping 
on 
the 
fad 
because 
you 
are 
afraid 
to 
stand 
for 
God 
s 
word 
I 
m 
applying 
your 
logic 
consistently 
and 
you 
just 
laugh 
dismissively 
without 
explanation 
Here 
s 
the 
thing 
you 
only 
want 
to 
apply 
that 
methodology 
to 
one 
thing 
because 
you 
are 
afraid 
of 
the 
pagan 
culture 
calling 
you 
a 
bigot 
according 
to 
their 
standards 
It 
s 
moral 
cowardliness 
But 
they 
loved 
money 
and 
all 
love 
is 
from 
God 
and 
if 
you 
love 
money 
it 
must 
be 
because 
it 
s 
an 
expression 
of 
the 
image 
of 
God 
right 
What 
part 
of 
I 
am 
the 
Lord 
You 
shall 
not 
lie 
with 
a 
male 
as 
with 
a 
woman 
it 
is 
an 
abomination

you

Having 
said 
that

doctrine

When 
a

early 
Christian 
is

it

I 
know 
the 
type

people 
you

interpretation 
is 
no 
different 
from 
classical 
interpretations 
I 
recognize 
that 
when 
John 
writes 
about 
agape 
love 
being 
of 
and 
coming 
from 
God 
he 
t 
talking 
about 
the 
definition 
of 
love 
as 
defined 
by 
depraved 
God 
hating 
pagans 
The 
Greeks 
who 
wallowed 
in

collapsed 
The 
Romans 
who 
wallowed 
in

collapsed 
into 
chaos 
until 
Constantine 
came 
around 
so 
you 
can 
sprinkle 
some 
Jesus 
on 
sodomy 
and 
that 
makes 
it 
all 
good 
How 
about 
any 
of 
those 
other 
sins 
You 
know 
that 
t 
work 
You 
re 
being 
slippery 
In 
the 
Jewish 
Christian 
everything 
is 
theological 
The 
act 
is 
presented 
typologically 
and 
rhetorically 
as 
pure 
rebellion 
against 
God 
and 
His 
created 
order 
and 
this 
is 
presented 
as 
accompanying 
other 
abominations 
in 
general 
sense 
People 
were 
doing 
sodomy 
in 
the 
temples 
They 
were 
doing 
it 
above 
the 
taverns 
They 
were 
doing 
it 
in 
palaces 
of 
rulers 
They 
were 
doing 
it 
in 
the 
fields 
They 
were 
doing 
it 
in 
the 
academy 
I 
think 
you 
re 
missing 
the 
point 
Where 
s 
the 
money 
Where 
s 
the 
abuse 
It 
s 
men 
who 
bed 
other 
men 
Stop 
being 
slippery 
For 
if 
their 
laws 
are 
righteous 
their 
gods 
are 
unrighteous 
since 
they 
transgressed 
the 
law 
in 
killing 
one 
another 
and 
sorcery 
and 
committing 
adultery 
and 
in 
robbing 
and 
stealing 
and 
in 
lying

by 
their 
other 
Apology 
of 
Aristides 
I 
just 
gave 
the 
quote

It 
s 
a 
list 
of 
sins 
including 
men 
who 
abuse

men 
who 
bed 
with 
other 
men 
Yes 
yes 
but 
like 
I 
said 
they 
never 
give 
the 
quotes 
I 
just 
gave 
the 
one 
from 
Acts 
of 
John 
and 
it 
has 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
economics 
Your 
source 
is 
deceptive 
Where 
s 
the 
quotes 
Let 
the 
murderer 
know 
punishment 
is 
laid 
up 
for 
him 
twofold 
after 
his 
departure 
Likewise 
also 
thou 
poisoner 
sorcerer 
robber 
defrauder 
sodomite 
thief 
and 
as 
many 
as 
are 
of 
that 
band

shall 
come 
at

unquenchable 
fire 
Acts 
of 
John 
I 
m 
open 
to 
the 
possibility 
that 
this 
anti 
conspiracy 
exists 
for 
thousands 
of 
years 
and 
everyone 
was 
in 
on 
it 
until 
just 
recently 
People 
talk 
of 
the 
other 
usages 
but 
they 
never 
quote 
them 
Why 
don 
t 
you 
share 
some 
God 
gave 
them 
up 
to 
dishonorable 
passions 
For 
their 
women 
exchanged 
natural 
relations 
for 
those 
that 
are 
contrary 
to 
nature 
and 
the 
men 
likewise 
gave 
up 
natural 
relations 
with 
women 
and 
were 
consumed 
with 
passion 
for 
one 
another 
men 
committing 
shameless 
acts 
with 
men 
Rom 
Yes 
The 
context 
is 
abundantly 
clear 
There 
s 
no 
debate 
among 
anyone 
who 
t 
a 
heretic 
Did 
you 
skip 
biology 
But 
that 
s 
not 
what 
the 
word 
means 
If 
it 
were 
then 
they 
d 
use 
the 
masculine 
form 
of 
prostitute 
and 
tie 
it 
to 
the 
word 
temple 
Paul 
was 
referring 
to 
Lev 
which 
does 
not 
say 
men 
can 
sleep 
with 
men 
as 
long 
as 
it 
t 
in 
the 
context 
of 
idolatry 
at 
the 
pagan 
temple 
t 
use 
the 
same 
word 
as 
Paul 
but 
it 
was 
similar 
Of 
those 
most 
clearly 
mean 
what 
Paul 
means 
ancient 
homosexuals 
So 
there 
was 
a 
massive 
conspiracy 
to 
cover 
up 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
word 
for 
men 
who 
bed 
other 
men 
t 
actually 
mean 
men 
who 
bed 
other 
men 
and 
the 
people 
we 
can 
trust 
to 
translate 
it 
to 
mean 
something 
untranslatable 
tend 
to 
all 
be 
gay 
activists 
Paul 
takes 
the 
Septuagint 
trans 
of 
Lev 
which 
mentions 
men 
bed 
and 
puts 
them 
together 
to 
give 
his 
word 
for 
homosexual 
a 
distinctly 
Lev 
feel 
The 
vast 
majority 
of 
texts 
clearly 
refer 
to 
homosexuals 
Do 
they 
all 
No 
Was 
it 
a 
reflection 
of 
Greek 
hyperbolic 
polemic 
Probably 
Yes 
Paul 
invented 
a 
new 
word 
by 
combining 
two 
words 
that 
have 
a 
common 
heritage 
in 
the 
Septuagint 
Other 
writers 
used 
the 
term 
or 
a 
variation 
of 
it 
centuries 
later 
and 
seemed 
to 
give 
it 
a 
modified 
meaning 
What 
writers 
did 
centuries 
later 
t 
change 
the 
meaning 
of 
Paul 
Did 
they 
stumble 
upon 
some 
new 
manuscripts 
Why 
the 
change 
It 
s 
simple 
they 
are 
selling 
out 
to 
popular 
pagan 
culture 
and 
they 
are 
tired 
of 
being 
accused 
of 
bigotry 
and 
since 
they 
don 
t 
care 
for 
scripture 
much 
anyhow 
they 
shipped 
the 
Bible 
to 
the 
chopping 
block 
Paul 
t 
alone 
Jesus 
brother 
Jude 
spoke 
of 
the 
damnable 
sin 
of 
pursuing 
unnatural 
forbidden 
flesh 
If 
I 
am 
in 
the 
wrong 
then 
every 
commentator 
has 
been 
wrong 
up 
until 
a 
few 
decades 
ago 
and 
that 
raises 
serious 
questions 
how 
not 
one 
but 
countless 
writers 
could 
be 
so 
confused 
I 
aim 
to 
have 
proper 
theology 
or 
least 
know 
the 
boundaries 
of 
what 
can 
exist 
within 
proper 
theology 
Scripture 
says 
that 
God 
says 
that 
men 
shall 
not 
have 
sex 
with 
other 
men 
Jesus 
t 
die 
on 
the 
cross 
to 
abolish 
that 
law 
and 
Paul 
makes 
it 
crystal 
clear 
that 
nothing 
changed 
What 
is 
proper 
theology 
to 
an 
agnostic 
That 
was 
a 
rhetorical 
question 
Unless 
you 
have 
any 
other 
questions 
comments 
or 
concerns 
I 
think 
that 
pretty 
much 
wraps 
it 
up 
You 
re 
agnostic 
and 
I 
know 
where 
you 
stand 
You 
should 
know 
where 
I 
stand 
It 
has 
been 
a 
pleasure 
conversing 
And 
these 
things 
t 
up 
for 
review 
by 
sinful 
man 
every 
generation 
or 
so 
God 
is 
at 
the 
head 
of 
proper 
theology 
not 
sinful 
man 
and 
where 
He 
has 
spoken 
the 
issue 
is 
closed 
Excellent 
The 
main 
point 
however 
is 
that 
we 
are 
commanded 
first 
and 
foremost 
to 
love 
God 
and 
that 
entails 
keeping 
His 
commandments 
If 
He 
says 
don 
t 
give 
your 
love 
to 
idols 
or 
money 
or 
prideful 
self 
love 
or 
unlawful 
sex 
then 
it 
is 
in 
keeping 
with 
the 
greatest 
commandment 
Jesus 
was 
asked 
about 
it 
and 
he 
just 
changed 
the 
subject 
to 
talk 
about 
the 
resurrection 
of 
the 
dead 
Having 
said 
that 
there 
is 
a 
aspect 
to 
the 
law 
i 
e 
a 
shadow 
of 
the 
Christ 
seen 
in 
the 
story 
of 
Ruth 
and 
it 
s 
importance 
in 
the 
genealogy 
of 
Christ 
I 
honestly 
would 
have 
to 
give 
that 
some 
thought 
My 
knee 
jerk 
reaction 
is 
that 
it 
was 
tied 
to 
the 
clan 
system 
of 
land 
ownership 
in 
Israel 
The 
fact 
that 
the 
NT 
t 
seem 
to 
bring 
it 
up 
seems 
to 
support 
the 
argument 
for 
abrogation 
but 
I 
honestly 
haven 
t 
given 
it 
much 
thought 
Love 
in 
English 
encompasses 
four 
Greek 
words 
Agape 
and 
Agape 
is 
the 
deep 
love

scripture 
deals 
with 
most 
Confusing 
the 
other 
forms 
with 
agape 
leads 
to 
confusion 
Are 
you 
asking 
about 
whether 
Christians 
are 
still 
required 
to 
marry 
their

widow 
or 
would 
that 
be 
properly 
filed 
under 
the 
Jewish 
that 
has 
been 
done 
away 
with 
The 
early 
Church 
most 
certainly 
did 
see 
all 
love 
that 
does 
not 
come 
from 
and 
conform 
with 
God 
as 
illegitimate 
It 
would 
be 
absurd 
to 
argue 
otherwise 
This 
is 
twitter 
It 
would 
help 
if 
you 
were 
more 
specific 
so 
I 
don 
t 
waste 
your 
time 
answering 
something 
you 
re

Idolatry

The

Try 
thousands 
of 
years 
I 
m 
just 
walking 
through 
Leviticus 
It 
s 
all 
there 
together 
Consenting 
love 
can 
still 
be 
perverse 
and 
God 
calls 
it 
such 
and 
calls 
His 
people 
to 
not 
take 
it 
lightly 
Do 
you 
understand 
the 
theology 
here 
It 
s 
not 
always 
abusive 
right 
What 
if 
mum 
and 
son 
are 
super 
into 
it 
Why 
t 
love 
win 
What 
s 
the 
big 
deal 
God 
said 
something 
about 
it 
but 
that 
was 
so 
long 
ago 
and 
we 
are 
more 
enlightened 
now 
so 
what 
s 
with 
these 
laws 
And 
the 
LORD 
says 
And 
you 
shall 
not 
lie 
with 
any 
animal 
and 
so 
make 
yourself 
unclean 
with 
it 
neither 
shall 
any 
woman 
give 
herself 
to 
an 
animal 
to 
lie 
with 
it 
it 
is 
perversion 
Is 
this 
still 
relevant 
today 
What 
if 
science 
finds 
out 
that 
the 
animals 
like 
it 
Adam 
t 
have 
the 
law 
We 
re 
talking 
about 
the 
revelation 
of 
God 
s 
law 
in 
history 
regarding 
incest 
What 
s 
the 
big 
deal 
Love 
knows 
no 
bounds 
right 
I 
don 
t 
make 
Australian 
laws 
Let 
s 
get 
back 
to 
the 
text 
What 
s 
wrong 
with 
incest 
Does 
God 
want 
His 
people 
to 
refrain 
from 
incest 
Is 
this 
up 
for 
a 
vote 
Does 
it 
matter 
if 
it 
becomes 
popular 
in 
the 
pagan 
culture 
You 
shall 
not 
uncover 
the 
nakedness 
of 
your 
father 
which 
is 
the 
nakedness 
of 
your 
mother 
she 
is 
your 
mother 
you 
shall 
not 
uncover 
her 
nakedness 
But 
hey 
what 
if 
it 
is 
not 
abusive 
loving 
and 
kind 
and 
cute 
Obviously 
God 
t 
talking 
about 
that 
right 
Is 
this 
how 
we 
do 
I 
mean 
things 
change 
right 
Moses 
had 
no 
idea 
that 
such 
a 
loving 
relationship 
could 
exist 
but 
we 
know 
better 
today 
that 
it 
is 
theoretically 
possible 
that 
this 
could 
become 
obsolete 
The 
Lord 
spoke 
to 
them 
not 
us 
right 
Is 
this 
how 
we 
do 
scripture 
Okay 
Let 
s 
see 
how 
I 
got 
it 
wrong 
as 
you 
imply 
None 
of 
you 
shall 
approach 
any 
one 
of 
his 
close 
relatives 
to 
uncover 
nakedness 
I 
am 
the 
Lord 
Does 
this 
depend 
on 
if 
a 
mum 
and 
son 
really 
love 
each 
other 
and 
want 
to 
raise 
a 
family 
in 
loving 
monogamous 
non 
abusive 
safe 
space 
In 
the 
Jewish 
context 
injustice 
is 
the 
same 
as 
unrighteousness 
and 
unholiness 
In 
other 
words 
nothing 
can 
be 
an 
injustice 
that 
is 
not 
unrighteous 
and 
unholy 
That 
means 
it 
s 
not 
up 
to 
the 
subjective 
feelings 
of 
sinful 
man 
to 
define 
justice 
or 
holiness 
by 
his 
own 
feelings 
I 
m 
talking 
about 
rebellion 
within 
the 
parameters 
of 
a 
Supreme 
Being 
who 
has 
entered 
into 
history 
and 
has 
spoken 
If 
you 
reject 
that 
premise 
nothing 
I 
am 
saying 
should 
make 
sense 
because 
then 
it 
all 
becomes 
subjective 
and 
up 
to 
a 
vote 
by 
sinful 
man 
You 
act 
as 
if 
science 
is 
some 
neutral 
ground 
where 
everyone 
agrees 
on 
this 
issue 
and 
we 
should 
just 
take 
our 
theological 
orders 
from 
what

we

spoken 
There 
is 
no 
falseness 
to 
mention 
other 
than 
doing 
what 
God 
makes 
crystal 
clear 
is 
unnatural 
and 
abominable 
I 
know 
this 
is 
strong 
language 
I 
t 
invent 
it 
It 
s 
not 
some 
cover 
for 
my 
hatred 
I 
have 
to 
ask 
myself 
Do 
I 
think 
God 
spoke 
on 
this 
issue 
The 
answer 
is 
yes 
We 
re 
talking 
about 
jurisdiction 
They 
can 
rebel 
all 
they 
want 
There 
are 
consequences 
Honor 
your 
father 
and 
your 
mother 
that 
your 
days 
may 
be 
long 
in 
the 
land 
that 
the 
Lord 
your 
God 
is 
giving 
you 
The 
consequences 
to 
this 
rebellion 
t 
always 
apparent 
but 
look 
the 
shortness 
of 
life 
the 
suicide 
the 
addiction 
Scripture 
says 
these 
are 
divine 
I 
understand 
this 
is 
the 
pagan 
It 
is 
not 
mine 
We 
see 
the 
fruit 
of 
the 
pagan 
approach 
to 
parenting 
and 
it 
so 
chaotic 
with 
everyone 
saying 
not

First 
off 
I

I

off 
it

Ergo 
it 
means

who

with

This 
is 
how 
the 
Septuagint 
translated 
the 
Hebrew 
in 
Lev 
It 
s 
not 
that 
mysterious 
Like 
I 
said 
the 
term 
abuse 
has 
lost 
its 
currency 
I 
want 
to 
make 
clear 
I 
am 
not 
some 
redneck 
fundamentalist 
I 
read 
a 
lot 
of 
Foucault 
amp 
co 
on 
this 
subject 
and 
the 
entire 
dynamic 
of 
the 
relationships 
now 
as 
it 
was 
back 
then 
has 
a 
power 
dynamic 
However 
not 
simple 
abuse 
See 
now 
this 
is 
basic 
th 
Commandment 
stuff 
The 
child 
is 
under 
the 
care 
of 
the 
mother 
and 
father 
but 
the 
child 
rejects 
that 
authority 
The 
child 
proceeds 
to 
reject 
the 
authority 
of 
scripture 
and 
the 
authority 
of 
God 
This 
is 
the 
most 
cascading 
form 
of 
rebellion 
I 
would 
certainly 
hope 
you 
t 
think 
he

that

both 
cases

sophistry

with 
a 
lot 
of 
complex 
human 
emotions 
which 
obscure 
the 
game 
itself 
This 
is 
very 
touchy 
territory 
The 
meaning 
is 
derived 
from 
context 
Paul

thrown 
an 
innocent 
rape 
victim 
out 
of

Kingdom 
of 
God 
His

cooperation 
on 
both 
parties 
involved 
active 
passive 
There 
s 
no 
way 
around 
Matthew 
Vines 
et 
can 
try 
but 
it 
s 
bordering 
on 
the 
absurd 
uses 
two 
terms 
meaning 
the 
passive 
homosexual 
partner 
and 
meaning 
the 
active 
homosexual 
It 
s 
graphic 
enough 
to 
leave

it

Okay 
we

We

they

from

I 
wonder 
what

up

With 
all

you 
don

our

Jesus 
gave 
the

that 
called
