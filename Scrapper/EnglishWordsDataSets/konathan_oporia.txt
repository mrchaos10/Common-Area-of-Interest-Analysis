Not 
the 
best 
actually 
when 
Martial 
and 
are 
still 
around 
however 
he 
will 
be 
close 
to

The 
love 
between

is 
unbelievable

I 
can 
see

We 
have 
to 
stop

by 
all

a

is 
not 
enough 
Come

What 
makes 
me 
to 
wonder 
is 
how 
Ole 
changed 
our 
style 
and 
attitude 
of 
play 
within 
hrs 
and 
yet 
it 
took 
Jose 
years 
to 
change 
from 
Van 
s 
style 
He 
t 
want 
to 
take 
it 
but 
then 
he 
celebrated 
with 
much 
passion 
after 
the 
goal 
that 
he 
even 
forgot 
that 
he 
never 
wanted 
him 
to

it

he 
is

for 
everything 
It 
hurts 
a

My

I

games 
agreed 
I 
vote 
of 
for

Jose 
was 
frustrated 
it 
was 
a 
must 
win 
yet 
t 
use 
his 
head 
it 
s 
normal 
for 
the

react 
in 
that 
way

I

wandered

Jones 
disproved 
me 
It 
was 
a 
different 
case 
today 
they 
were 
passing 
the 
ball 
very 
first 
the 
only 
problem 
was 
a 
goal 
scorer 
Why 
should 
you 
start 
Jones 
yet 
you 
have 
Bailey 
I 
believe 
Jose 
wants 
to 
prove 
that 
he 
has 
the 
worst 
defense 
Imitating

lucky 
not 
to 
concede 
many 
in 
the

we 
are 
happy 
with 
important 
points 
however 
we 
need 
to

to 
start 
moving 
the

have 
been 
reading 
a 
lot 
about 
this 
that 
wait 
a

that

by

was 
more 
composed

Possible

That 
s 
what 
I

too 
there 
is 
a 
possibility 
Free

Mata 
Sorry 
May 
her 
soul 
rest

nothing

Dignity 
we

our

than 
their

It 
s 
so 
shameful 
It

Congratulation

It

not

happy 
even 
Bale 
wanted 
to 
leave 
Madrid 
of 
Dave 
Shaw 
Smalling 
Andres 
Mata 
Herrera 
and 
Martial 
I 
know 
many 
would 
want 
smalling 
out 
but 
he 
is 
the 
only 
defender 
we 
have 
who 
is 
always 
fit 
Shaw 
deserves 
more 
than 
that 
Especially 
at 
home 
however 
we 
need 
at 
least 
players 
in 
January 
no 
club 
needs 
that 
market 
more 
than 
us 
Our 
duty 
is 
to 
support 
our 
manager 
we 
hope 
the 
t 
true 
in 
Jose 
we 
trust 
It 
would 
surely 
be 
shameful 
well 
said 
Martial 
We 
hope 
for 
the 
best 
I 
still 
trust 
in 
our 
manager 
Trust 
me 
Jose 
adores 
our 
club 
he 
showed 
both 
frustration 
and 
Passion 
today 
believe 
me 
if 
the 
boys 
can 
play 
like 
they 
did 
in 
second 
half 
things 
will 
surely 
turn 
around 
I 
thought 
mark 
was 
a 
reasonable 
person 
but 
after 
reading 
this 
I 
lost 
respect 
for 
him 
I 
know 
it 
s 
tough 
to 
be 
a 
fan 
at 
the 
moment 
but 
we 
have 
to 
be 
strong 
support 
our 
team 
and 
hope 
for 
improvement 
not 
and 
wishing 
the 
team 
to 
loose 
so 
that 
a 
manager 
may 
sucked 
needs 
a 
rest 
You 
should 
have 
put 
it 
in 
plus 
for 
the 
start 
not 
max 
We 
need 
our 
players 
to 
be 
at 
their 
best 
so 
good 
luck 
to 
the 
boys 
Oh 
We 
surely 
need 
another 
striker 
in 
January 
Do 
you 
think 
whatever 
has 
been 
saying 
on 
media 
is 
good 
for 
a 
team 
as 
a 
leader 
Stop 
blaming 
the 
manager 
or 
shut 
up 
because 
the 
club 
is 
bigger 
than 
every 
player 
let 
him 
go 
if 
he 
wants 
his 
not 
better 
than 
Becks 
Rinaldo 
and 
many 
more 
What 
do 
you 
want 
the 
manager 
to 
do 
when 
players 
are 
not 
fighting 
for 
the 
badge 
you 
can 
t 
blame 
the 
manager 
for 
the 
past

Memphis 
Once 
a 
red 
always 
a 
red 
please 
come 
back 
home 
some 
day 
It 
s 
a 
tough 
one 
but 
I 
would 
go 
with 
either 
or 
martial 
I 
hope 
he 
can 
return 
home 
some 
day 
he 
still 
loves 
the 
club 
We 
all 
know 
how 
good 
the 
boy 
is 
so 
should 
we 
call 
you 
too 
Especially 
when 
he 
does 
not 
perform 
This 
should 
stop 
they 
are 
all 
our 
players 
and 
we 
need 
to 
support 
them 
unconditionally 
Can 
we 
see 
the 
first 
hat 
trick 
after 
long 
good 
luck 
to 
the 
team 
Wow 
wow 
wow 
Fred 
Martial 
and 
all 
are 
starting 
if 
they 
can 
find 
the 
balance 
then 
this 
attacking 
line 
can 
be 
unstoppable 
Just 
like 
seeing 
Liverpool 
being 
scored 
Come 
on 
be 
patient 
and 
wait 
until 
makes 
an 
error 
then 
you 
score 
so 
that 
Liverpool 
fans 
can 
blame 
Ramos 
once 
more 
what 
a 
joke 
is

After 
watching

wait

minute 
I 
m 
a

too 
what 
a 
lion 
can 
do 
I 
too 
can 
make 
it 
What 
a 
finish 
from 
our 
legend 
once 
a 
red 
always 
a 
red 
May 
be 
criminals 
just 
use 
bikes 
to

their 
missions

in

never

crisis 
our 
team 
even 
if 
we 
are 
down 
true 
Legend 
you 
will 
always 
be 
in 
our 
heart 
If 
you 
were 
a 
coach 
would 
you 
play 
a 
head 
of 
we 
should 
thank 
Jose 
at 
least 
for 
giving 
him 
chances 
even 
though 
it 
s 
out 
of 
position 
remember 
when 
t 
feet 
and 
he 
Rash 
was 
playing 
as 
a 
striker 
against 
Chelsea 
many 
fans 
wanted 
him 
substituted 
No 
way 
should 
stop 
deceiving 
Ugandans 
does 
it 
affect 
only 
citizens 
and 
not 
exported 
power 
there 
could 
be 
a 
motive 
behind 
that 
power 
blackout 
He 
is 
a 
strong 
guy 
who 
loves 
the 
club 
that 
s 
why 
he 
is 
loved 
by 
fans 
he 
t 
complain 
when 
benched 
and 
rather 
he 
keeps 
on 
fighting 
for 
his 
number 
he 
should 
be 
example 
to 
other 
players 
like 
Would 
you 
bench 
or 
Sanchez 
for 
Oh 
he 
would 
kick 
for 
using 
his 
mouth 
always 
other 
than 
legs 
and 
brain 
They 
are 
hypocrite 
after 
they 
failed 
to 
do 
justice 
now 
they 
have 
guts 
to 
show 
up 
there 
always 
giving 
Ugandans 
empty 
promises 
and 
violating 
our 
constitutional 
laws 
by 
arresting 
and 
torturing 
innocent 
people 
Not 
just 
because 
of 
his 
comment 
but 
his 
attitude 
too 
we 
can 
t 
keep 
a 
player 
whose 
heart 
desires 
somewhere 
else 
and 
can 
t 
fight 
for 
our 
budge 
it 
s 
better 
to 
sale 
him 
and 
sign 
as 
his 
replacement 
Bring 
him 
back 
already 
Good 
luck 
mate 
you 
will 
forever 
be 
remembered 
in 
a 
history 
Sage 
Only 
a 
player 
who 
is 
lazy 
would 
loose 
confidence 
over 
a 
demanding 
coach 
we 
know 
all 
this 
craps 
are 
created 
by 
anti 
Jose 
media 
group 
Good 
luck 
and 
welcome 
back 
Oh 
no 
what 
a 
research 
That 
s 
too 
much 
bro 
however 
this 
guy 
is 
not 
a 
fan 
I 
m 
glad 
that 
Jose 
has 
shut 
him 
up 
I

This 
can

there 
could 
be 
some 
fellows 
officials 
in 
FA

plotting 
against

as 
the 
saying 
goes 
it 
s 
easy 
to 
be 
number 
one 
but 
difficult 
to 
stay 
number 
one 
we 
are 
therefore 
we 
shall 
fight 
to 
prove 
our 
worth 
to 
all 
haters

How 
did 
get 
a 
red 
card 
for 
that 
he 
went 
to 
confront 
the 
guy 
he 
t 
the 
first 
to 
head 
Burt 
he 
ends 
up 
with 
a 
red 
card 
and 
the 
real 
culprit 
gets 
a 
yellow 
that 
shows 
how 
much 
people 
wanted 
us 
to 
loose 
another 
game 
but 
sorry 
for 
them 
we 
are 
In 
our 
last 
two 
matches 
we 
showed 
quality 
attacking 
football 
and 
speed 
not 
packing 
the 
bus 
as 
before 
I 
believe 
our 
style 
of 
play 
has 
greatly 
changed 
despite 
of 
our 
resent 
results 
Non 
of 
that 
will 
be 
written 
and 
said 
by 
double 
standard 
media 
guys 
Pairing 
smalling 
and 
Iceman 
is 
another 
night 
mare 
for 
us 
I 
believe 
that 
if 
they 
consider 
performance 
wise 
then 
he 
should 
have 
dropped 
Jesse 
other 
than 
Fred 
and 
Iceman 
for 
Bailey 
needs 
to 
prove 
that 
he 
is 
capable 
of 
leading 
us 
yes 
we 
know 
he 
is 
a 
great 
talent 
but 
he 
needs 
to 
be 
consistent 
and 
stop 
being 
too 
selfish 
however 
I 
would 
not 
drop 
for 
him 
Big 
up 
bro 
next 
time 
better 
we 
are 
together 
we 
shall 
overcome 
the 
present 
challenges 
It 
s 
a 
shame 
that 
a 
fan 
would 
be 
happy 
when 
his 
team 
loose 
just 
because 
they 
don 
t 
like 
a 
manager 
I 
still 
believe 
in 
Jose 
therefore 
plastic 
fans 
must 
either 
go 
out 
on 
loan 
or 
be 
ready 
to 
dream 
Jose 
is 
here 
to 
stay 
I 
think 
your 
critics 
of 
Jose 
has 
turned 
to 
obsession 
personal 
and 
baseless 
our 
job 
is 
to 
support 
our 
manager 
and 
players 
hoping 
for 
the 
best 
Birthday 
boy 
He 
is 
a 
great 
disgrace 
for 
time 
will 
come 
when 
the 
hunters 
will 
be 
hunted 
for 
now 
we 
pray 
for 
the 
recovery 
of 
and 
others 
What 
are 
we 
waiting 
for 
to 
give 
him 
anew 
contract 
It 
s 
one 
thing 
to 
play 
for 
spurs 
and 
another 
for 
at 
you 
are 
watched 
by 
many 
and 
by 
millions 
which 
will 
surely 
put 
you 
under 
more 
pressure 
unless 
you 
are 
mentally 
strong 
and 
that 
s 
the 
difference 
Well 
said 
big 
Sam 
Oh 
man 
Fred 
played 
very 
well 
it 
was 
only 
him 
and 
shaw 
who 
played 
to 
the 
standard 
Our 
problem 
was 
striking 
line 
and 
central 
defense 
Jose 
wanted 
a 
backup 
for 
and 
central 
defender 
however 
the 
board 
neglected 
his 
request 
now 
they 
should 
not 
blame 
him 
remember 
is 
the 
only 
proven 
striker 
we 
have 
if 
he 
fails 
or 
gets 
injured 
there 
is 
no 
one 
to 
cover 
up 
He 
did 
his 
best 
today 
he 
is 
not 
to 
be 
blamed 
Why 
should 
he 
send 
Jose 
out 
when 
he 
is 
the 
one 
to 
be 
blamed 
It 
s 
because 
he 
did 
his 
best 
but 
players 
t 
take 
up 
their 
responsibilities 
apart 
from 
Shaw 
and 
Fred 
We 
played 
a 
good 
game 
with 
poor 
goal 
scorers 
if 
you 
play 
an 
attacking 
game 
you 
need 
to 
score 
goals 
knowing 
that 
you 
will 
concede 
too 
and 
t 
do 
their 
job 
well 
that 
s 
my 
analysis 
He 
was 
the 
best 
in 
the 
game 
but 
shaw 
was 
the 
best 
player 
in 
the 
pitch 
Jose 
should 
stop 
gambling 
you 
can 
t 
bench 
a 
player 
like 
Bailey 
just 
because 
of 
one 
game 
it 
could 
affect 
his 
confidence 
however 
I 
m 
behind 
the 
team 
and 
I 
hope 
for 
the 
best 
Jose 
should 
stop 
gambling 
this 
is 
a 
must 
win 
game 
however 
I 
m 
behind 
the 
team 
though 
playing 
smalling 
and 
Jones 
in 
a 
back 
is 
a 
real 
gamble 
It 
was 
a 
very 
long 
week 
indeed 
may 
be 
they 
are 
Amen 
may 
his 
will 
be

driving 
us 
crazy 
Valencia 
is 
injured 
and 
you 
have 
the 
nerve 
to 
send 
This 
young 
talented 
lad 
parking 
Believe 
me 
this 
is 
a 
account 
check 
and 
I 
hope 
you 
are 
jocking 
your 
holidays 
starts 
tomorrow 
after 
transfer 
deadline 
time 
Oh 
my 
friend 
you 
are 
too 
much 
We 
are 
the 
richest 
club 
for 
God 
s 
sake 
why 
can 
t 
we 
spend 
money 
on 
quality 
players 
other 
than 
looking 
for 
barter 
trade 
Still 
director 
of 
football 
without 
backing 
of 
the 
board 
is 
useless 
How 
can 
you 
sale 
him 
for 
m 
and 
buy 
unproven 
replacement 
for 
m 
Is 
that 
even 
possible 
We 
have 
to 
know 
that 
media 
is 
playing 
mind 
games 
with 
us 
come 
to 
think 
of 
it 
wants 
a 
return 
to 
at 
the 
same 
time 
he 
wants 
to 
join 
these 
guys 
want 
to 
destabilize 
our 
squad 
from 
De 
to 
martial 
and 
now 
This 
is 
a 
media 
game 
and 
business 
we 
can 
t 
believe 
whatever 
we 
read 
ask 
your 
self 
why 
it 
s 
only 
players 
it 
s 
simple 
the 
want 
to 
sale 
their 
papers 
and 
without 
on 
it 
you 
can 
t 
do 
business 
Fella 
is 
not 
as 
important 
as 
martial 
that 
s 
why 
he 
is 
more 
disappointed 
of 
him 
than 
fella 
Even 
Sanchez 
is 
better 
than 
Hazard 
so 
shut 
up 
is 
not 
for 
sale 
would 
you 
give 
us 
hazard 
if 
we 
offered 
you 
and 
m 
I 
hope 
Woodward 
and 
the 
board 
are 
watching 
it 
too 
Fans 
are 
frustrated 
they 
should 
understand 
that 
a 
club 
can 
t 
stand 
without 
fans 
therefore 
quality 
players 
and 
entertaining 
football 
is 
a 
must 
this 
season 
When 
your 
agent 
tries 
to 
squeeze 
every 
last 
penny 
out 
of 
you 
t 
co 
Remember 
there 
s 
no 
martial 
and 
young 
these 
are 
all 
first 
team 
players 
We 
fans 
out 
of 
UK 
and 
Ireland 
are 
disappointed 
that 
we 
cant 
watch 
the 
game 
Martial 
needs 
time 
to 
be 
stable 
both 
physically 
and 
mentally 
a 
lot 
has 
been 
said 
about 
him 
and 
Jose 
that 
s 
what 
makes 
you 
to 
be 
a 
united 
player 
media 
does 
these 
things 
always 
to 
destabilize 
either 
our 
managers 
or 
players 
and 
it 
s 
up 
to 
you 
either 
to 
fight 
or 
runaway 
like 
a 
coward 
He 
surely 
deserves 
a 
chance 
why 
send 
him 
on 
loan 
a 
gain 
It 
can 
t 
be 
a 
joke 
because 
he 
has 
to 
respect 
the 
club 
He 
should 
have 
gone 
and 
return 
early 
since 
most 
first 
team 
players 
were 
not 
around 
remember 
Jose 
s 
daughter 
was 
graduating 
the 
day 
our 
team 
was 
traveling 
to 
us 
but 
he 
traveled 
with 
the 
team 
rather 
than 
joining 
his 
daughter 
Maturity 
and 
quality 
that 
s 
why 
I 
never 
wanted 
Blind 
to 
be 
sold 
Another 
option 
in 
our 
midfield 
Jose 
won 
t 
surely 
want 
to 
loose 
though 
it 
s 
just 
a 
friendly 
and 
we 
don 
t 
have 
our 
star 
players 
a 
draw 
would 
work 
Jones 
should 
be 
the 
one 
to 
give 
way 
not 
for 
Gods 
sake 
t 
co 
r 
Northampton 
were 
a 
better 
side 
they 
deserved 
a 
win 
good 
luck 
to 
the 
boys 
next 
time 
better 
is 
better 
than 
Jones 
so 
it 
would 
be 
fair 
to 
trade 
with 
Jones 
instead 
It 
s 
better 
for 
those 
fans 
to 
go 
out 
on 
loan 
if 
they 
can 
t 
support 
a 
team 
at 
a 
tough 
time 
Shane 
the 
start 
of 
our 
down 
fall 
we 
should 
encouraged 
them 
and 
giving 
credit 
where 
it 
s 
due 
Shane 
Shane 
I 
remember 
the 
first 
matches 
in 
Van 
reign 
we 
were 
playing 
beautiful 
game 
and 
every 
one 
enjoyed 
it 
even 
with 
Rooney 
in 
midfield 
against 
Chelsea 
but 
we 
were 
not 
scoring 
much 
goals 
then 
negativity 
started 
blaming 
and 
both 
the 
manager 
and 
players 
amp 
it 
was 
Wendy 
That 
is 
the 
spirit 
mate 
I 
don 
t 
like 
negativity 
around 
our 
fan 
base 
remember 
we 
are 
the 
richest 
club 
and 
other 
clubs 
do 
want 
to 
overcharge 
us 
whenever 
we 
approach 
them 
of 
cause 
we 
can 
t 
just 
give 
them 
much 
money 
because 
they 
want 
There 
is 
unnecessary 
negativity 
in 
our 
fan 
base 
it 
s 
our 
duty 
to 
support 
our 
manager 
and 
players 
no 
matter 
the 
situation 
but 
what 
I 
have 
observed 
for 
the 
past 
months 
we 
are 
slowly 
becoming 
like 
Liverpool 
fans 
He 
accepted 
to 
play 
in 
any 
position 
we 
have 
seen 
most 
players 
being 
converted 
from 
left 
back 
to 
wingers 
and 
midfielder 
to 
defender 
so 
that 
t 
be 
a 
problem 
It 
s 
above 
human 
knowledge 
but 
not 
God 
if 
only 
they 
know 
that 
Jesus 
heals 
they 
would 
be 
on 
their 
knees 
praying 
right 
now 
How 
many 
times 
will 
they 
agree 
on 
the 
terms 
we 
are 
fed 
up 
of 
this 
news 
Would 
you 
enjoy 
watching 
youths 
without 
trophies 
It 
s 
better 
to 
sale 
smalling 
or 
Jones 
than 
who 
compares 
martial 
to 
martial 
is 
not 
for 
sale 
If 
spurs 
want 
martial 
they 
should 
give 
us 
Kane 
and 
Ali 
in 
exchange 
because 
martial 
is 
more 
talented 
than 
both 
of 
them 
If 
martial 
keeps 
on 
doing 
what 
we 
all 
know 
he 
is 
capable 
of 
until 
the 
attacking 
trio 
returns 
I 
believe 
he 
will 
keep 
his 
place 
We 
should 
be 
happy 
that 
Woodward 
does 
not 
want 
to 
sale 
him 
or 
else 
we 
shall 
regret 
just 
like 
we 
did 
with 
Nathan 
why 
do 
you 
hate 
martial 
so 
much 
And 
yet 
some 
people 
are 
after 
head 
for 
yesterdays 
game 
He 
is 
a 
natural 
number 
very 
first 
talented 
and 
has 
an 
eye 
for 
goal 
Most 
people 
haven 
t 
seen 
the 
best 
of 
yet 
sometime 
back 
I 
said 
the 
kid 
is 
too 
talented 
for 
his 
age 
and 
deserves 
to 
be 
in 
first 
team 
That 
was 
close 
indeed 
it 
s 
on 
It 
was 
better 
to 
let 
him 
run 
with 
the 
ball 
than 
pulling 
his 
shirt 
or 
knocking 
him 
down 
to 
avoid 
a 
blow 
or 
kick 
We 
can 
t 
blame 
Jose 
because 
it 
s 
the 
work 
of 
Woodward 
and 
the 
board 
to 
sign 
players 
that 
the 
manager 
needs 
is 
heading 
to 
Madrid 
How 
many 
months 
are 
needed 
because 
I 
have 
never 
seen 
your 
airtime 
I 
m 
happy 
for 
him 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
I 
m 
sad 
that 
we 
lost 
a 
multipurpose 
player 
just 
like 
O 
Shea 
Back 
to 
the 
sender 
that 
s 
mission 
impossible 
Once 
a 
red 
always 
a 
red 
forever 
we 
shall 
cherish 
that 
memory 
I 
remember 
before 
Jose 
went 
back 
to 
Chelsea 
most 
fans 
were 
blaming 
Woodward 
for 
not 
going 
after 
him 
and 
now 
they 
want 
him 
out 
shame 
upon 
you 
it 
s 
our 
duty 
to 
stand 
by 
our 
manager 
I 
love 
his 
work 
Woodward 
just 
needs 
to 
deliver 
all 
what 
Jose 
needs 
and 
we 
shall 
be 
the 
champions 
We 
all 
have 
seen 
some 
great 
football 
from 
under 
Jose 
than 
for 
France 
is 
Jose 
to 
be 
blamed 
for 
his 
inconsistency 
Why 
can 
t 
we 
acknowledged 
the 
great 
work 
from 
Jose 
who 
develops 
him 
for 
a 
season 
for 
France 
to 
gain 
from 
Jose 
s 
hard 
work 
I 
believe 
we 
have 
some 
delicate 
fans 
I 
m 
just 
fed 
up 
of 
people 
who 
claim 
to 
be 
fans 
and 
yet 
they 
can 
t 
even 
stand 
by 
the 
manager 
we 
are 
all 
aware 
that 
it 
s 
only 
under 
Jose 
that 
we 
have 
achieved 
a 
dream 
of 
going 
back 
where 
we 
belong 
sis 
sir 
Alex 
left 
our 
club 
why 
should 
you 
blame 
him 
for 
Woodward 
s 
failures 
Every 
fan 
has 
to 
feel 
for 
Martial 
apart 
from 
some 
fans 
who 
are 
on 
loan 
at 
our 
club 
but 
he 
surely 
deserved 
to 
be 
there 
Now 
that 
world 
cup 
is 
done 
we 
have 
to 
turn 
our 
attention 
to 
tour 
the 
lads 
are 
off 
today 
to 
US 
they 
were 
the 
best 
team 
with 
over 
ball 
possession 
today 
but 
it 
t 
their 
day 
believe 
me 
there 
are 
only 
teams 
who 
played 
as 
a 
team 
in 
this 
tournament 
France 
Croatia 
and 
England 
however 
I 
m 
happy 
for 
Oh 
my 
God 
what 
a 
goal 
France 
NO 
Oh 
my 
dear 
I 
fear 
for 
your 
career 
in 
ten 
months 
time 
you 
will 
be 
out 
of 
job 
let 
alone 
the 
dream 
of 
years 
I 
would 
still 
give 
shaw 
a 
chance 
Eric 
Bailly 
is 
a 
savage 
t 
co 
And 
why 
do 
you 
think 
they 
are 
Remember 
they 
are 
among 
teams 
with 
most 
average 
players 
but 
unity 
in 
their 
team 
made 
them 
to 
reach 
where 
they 
ended 
therefore 
they 
deserve 
all 
the 
praise 
Academy 
lads 
No 
way 
I 
can 
t 
sale 
martial 
to 
buy 
any 
other 
player 
not 
even 
remember 
he 
is 
just 
And 
what 
happens 
to 
club 
football 
during 
that 
period 
We 
have 
to 
check 
your 
quality 
against

Happy

Uganda 
we 
loved 
you 
a 
lot 
as

The

will 
always 
be 
challenged 
as 
you 
all 
know 
it 
s 
easy 
to 
be 
number 
one 
but 
very 
hard 
to 
maintain 
number 
one 
Who 
s 
better 
for 
Sanchez 
Like 
for 
t 
co 
M 
Always 
hated 
but 
never 
ignored 
we 
all 
know 
what 
Sanchez 
can 
do 
but 
only 
because 
he 
s 
playing 
for 
that 
hate 
and 
rivalry 
won 
t 
allow 
many 
to 
accept 
the 
truth 
was 
more 
of 
a 
team 
player 
than 
Hazard 
I 
said 
it 
last 
week 
that 
unless 
the 
manager 
solves 
the 
issue 
between 
Hazard 
and 
they 
t 
pass 
France 
He 
either 
wanted 
to 
show 
that 
he 
was 
the 
main 
man 
or 
that 
he 
is 
the 
right 
guy 
to 
replace 
CR 
it 
s 
a 
tough 
one 
for 
us 
as 
fans 
to 
choose 
from 
our 
players 
who 
to 
support 
however 
I 
hope 
could 
make 
a 
record 
that 
could 
bring 
smile 
to 
all 
fans 
after 
transfer 
to 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
I 
don 
t 
want 
to 
see 
sad 
t 
co 
I 
would 
take 
all 
including 
Greenwood 
now 
that 
most 
guys 
will 
be 
in 
holidays 
Quality 
cross 
from 
Jesse 
Including 
sterling 
We 
have 
to 
thank 
Madrid 
for 
refusing 
to 
sale 
to 
us 
otherwise 
we 
t 
have 
signed 
It 
was 
almost 
my 
first 
time 
to 
see 
Fella 
currying 
the 
ball 
up 
front 
not 
giving 
side 
balls 
and 
back 
passes 
it 
was 
indeed 
a 
right 
decision 
to 
keep 
him 
in 
our 
club 
t 
co 
It 
s 
evident 
that 
Hazard 
does 
not 
want 
to 
pass 
balls 
to 
he 
rather 
run 
and 
make 
an 
attempt 
by 
himself 
than 
passing 
it 
to 
most 
balls 
that 
reach 
were 
from 
Kevin 
D 
The 
manager 
has 
to 
solve 
the 
problem 
between 
Hazard 
and 
before 
facing 
France 
otherwise 
it 
won 
t 
be 
good 
for 
them 
it 
s 
evident 
that 
hazard 
is 
jealous 
of 
scoring 
can 
you 
see 
what 
i 
told 
you 
the 
last 
time 
played 
the 
difference 
between 
and 
hazard 
nevertheless 
i 
m 
happy 
that 
and 
are 
out 
Imprisoned 
for 
love 
t 
co 
France 
and 
Why 
do 
you 
punish 
the 
poor 
because 
people 
who 
use 
the 
media 
for 
criminal 
activities 
could 
be 
rich 
people 
now 
what 
next 
for 
students 
and 
other 
low 
earners 
who 
need 
this 
for 
easy 
communication 
and 
yet 
they 
can 
t 
afford 
it 
now 
There 
is 
a 
wise 
saying 
that 
Never 
kick 
someone 
who 
is 
already 
down 
or 
else 
you 
may 
regret 
later 
England 
became 
a 
completed 
striker 
after 
joining

other 
players 
under 
performed 
because 
of 
the 
pressure 
put 
on 
them 
by 
the

former

why 
should 
we 
blame 
all 
these 
things 
on 
Jose

you 
forgotten 
that 
we 
are 
in 
our 
best

Give

it

deserved 
Jose 
has 
contributed 
a 
lot 
to 
the 
development 
of 
those 
young 
boys 
why 
can 
t 
you 
blame 
for 
Rash 
s

I 
can 
t 
believe 
the 
coach 
had 
to 
take 
that 
long 
to 
introduce 
him 
they 
were 
very 
lucky 
Oh 
this 
is 
world 
cup 
things 
are 
not 
easy 
at 
all 
i 
was 
a 
little 
bit 
scared

Is 
it 
just

never 
wanted 
to 
pass 
balls 
to 
at 
a 
right 
time 
It 
would 
be 
the 
best 
moment 
in 
this 
world 
cup 
for 
me 
I 
feel 
sorry 
for 
him 
Come 
on 
Dave 
saves 
today 
is 
your 
day 
prove 
to 
the 
world 
what 
you 
are 
made 
of 
t 
co 
m 
Martial 
deserved 
to 
be 
in 
Russia 
no 
matter 
the 
circumstance 
i 
believe 
there 
are 
hidden 
personal 
a 
gender 
by 
Oh 
my 
friend 
you 
know 
how 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
situation 
however 
this 
time 
i 
approve 
your 
point 
we 
are 
indeed 
fed 
up 
of 
these 
guys 
they 
think 
that 
everybody 
is 
rich 
like 
them 
they 
forget 
that 
it 
s 
not 
the 
poor 
who 
violate 
their 
laws 
especially 
social 
networks 
I 
think 
this 
character 
is 
taught 
at 
i 
watched 
Di 
maria 
yesterday 
and 
he 
was 
doing 
the 
same 
I 
hope 
the 
young 
French 
lad 
wont 
follow 
their 
footsteps 
Thank 
you 
its 
unbelievable 
but 
true 
Bryan 
that 
team 
lucked 
creativity 
no 
one 
was 
carrying 
the 
ball 
to 
forwards 
from 
midfield 
and 
the 
manager 
should 
have 
that 
he 
needed 
another 
midfielder 
and 
again 
he 
should 
have 
played 
as 
a 
winger 
due 
to 
his 
pace 
I 
hope 
they 
will 
reorganize 
this 
team 
is 
not 
getting 
enough 
services 
and 
can 
someone 
explain 
why 
Arnold 
is 
taking 
all 
set 
pieces 
the 
manager 
should 
change 
to 
number 
It 
s 
time 
for 
Gaby 
to 
rule 
the 
Boss 
t 
co 
But 
because 
he 
is 
and 
playing 
for 
he 
is 
subjected 
to 
critics 
not 
praise 
The 
same 
Fella 
who 
scored 
a 
winner 
against 
arsenal 
so 
shut 
up 
Besides 
him 
speaking 
crap 
why 
can 
t 
they 
speak 
of 
luck 
of 
playing 
time 
if 
that 
was 
Jose 
then 
they 
would 
be 
speaking 
trash 
about 
Jose 
delaying 
his 
progress 
and 
the 
boy 
wanting 
to 
leave 
that 
s 
the 
only 
thing 
English 
media 
are 
best 
at 
He 
is 
loosing 
the 
respect 
fans 
had 
for 
him 
always 
speaking 
negative 
about 
the 
players 
and 
the 
manager 
That 
is 
true 
Nathan 
Fella 
is 
not 
a 
starter 
unless 
Jose 
thinks 
otherwise 
he 
might 
be 
used 
as 
a 
backup 
for 
number 
ten 
and 
those 
who 
slam 
Dave 
saves 
t 
co

Paul

Because 
he 
is 
not 
De 
Man 
has 
and 
That 
s 
true 
bro 
I 
feel 
to 
him 
That 
would 
be 
the 
best 
decision 
it 
would 
bring 
more 
out 
of 
him 
and 
indeed 
make 
him 
more 
mature 
than 
he 
is 
Even 
smalling 
and 
Jones 
are 
better 
than 
this 
Scared 
leads 
to 
fear 
and 
fear 
is 
the 
greatest 
weapon 
of 
Satan 
therefore 
it 
s 
not 
OK 
to 
be 
scared 
Jose 
must 
be 
proud 
just 
like 
us 
Bring 
him 
back 
as 
back 
up 
Give 
him 
chance 
already 
People 
do 
speak 
a 
lot 
about 
Brazil 
but 
i 
assure 
you 
that 
Belgium 
is 
the 
best 
team 
in 
this 
world 
cup 
they 
play 
as 
steam 
not 
individual 
club 
rivalries 
are 
put 
aside 
for

Oh 
my 
God 
that

It 
s 
a 
shame 
that 
you 
can 
only 
look 
for 
his 
poor 
touches 
not 
contributions 
or 
goal 
scoring 
record 
We 
can 
t 
judge 
him 
by 
that 
game 
but 
rejecting 
over 
m 
was 
a 
gamble 
he 
is 
over 
rated 
some 
do 
rate 
him 
even 
above 
because 
of 
some 
few 
bad 
games 
that 
had 
even 
though 
we 
know 
what 
he 
can 
do 
if 
we

will 
say 
he 
is

always 
hated 
never 
ignored

X 
t

When 
did 
Portugal 
play 
Iceland 
This 
will 
surely 
affect 
his 
game 
if 
he 
wants 
to 
be 
at 
the 
level 
of 
CR 
and 
then 
he 
should 
stop 
that 
mentality 
Oh 
these 
guys 
once

red 
always 
a 
red 
t 
co 
Not 
even 
retiring 
but 
he 
s 
going 
to 
be 
sucked 
He 
should 
start 
in 
the 
next 
game 
Sure 
Then 
Would 
it 
be 
wise 
to 
spend 
m 
on 
Bale 
at 
that 
age 
First 
you 
reported 
trucks 
yesterday

now

can

wait 
for 
tomorrow

matches 
with

He 
was 
falling 
and 
complaining 
a 
lot 
he 
wanted 
too 
much 
protection 
from 
the 
officials 
sorry 
for 
him 
He 
wants 
much 
protection 
Check 
in 
it 
was 
during 
Van 
s 
reign 
he 
said 
a 
lot 
that 
can 
offend 
every 
united 
fan 
that 
got 
a 
chance 
to 
watch 
it 
to 
say 
that 
if 
he 
was 
to 
come 
to 
he 
would 
be 
the 
one 
to 
teach 
Rooney 
so 
we 
should 
go 
for 
mane 
of 
instead 
It 
would 
make 
my 
weekend 
perfect 
So 
annoying 
i 
disliked 
them 
the 
moment 
i 
watched 
s 
reaction 
to 
his 
link 
with 
united 
before 
he 
joined 
he 
said 
i 
don 
t 
want 
to 
join 
united 
a 
club 
which 
has 
been 
rejected 
by 
ramps 
and 
Xavier 
above 
all 
not 
even 
the 
best 
in 
CH 
I 
still 
have 
his 
Jersey 
The 
reason 
i 
supported 
I 
hope 
they 
will 
manage 
to 
keep 
Germany 
from 
scoring 
one 
more 
goal 
from 
and 
it 
will 
be 
done 
If 
he 
was 
a 
player 
media 
would 
have 
slaughtered 
him 
i 
love 
this 
game 
It 
would 
have 
been 
a 
perfect 
night 
if 
it 
was 
not 
De 
in 
goal 
i 
feel 
terrible 
as 
a 
fan 
A 
tough 
night 
for 
our 
goal 
keeper 
i 
hope 
he 
comes 
back 
stronger 
It 
s 
indeed 
a 
night 
to 
forget 
That 
goal 
has 
broken 
my 
heart 
i 
t 
believe 
David 
would 
concede 
all 
those 
goals 
He 
s 
not 
De 
we 
all 
know 
he 
is 
not 
stable 
at

That 
would 
be 
the

expense 
of

why 
i 
hate

rest

m 
an 
English 
fan 
besides 
that 
i 
will 
support 
every 
team 
with 
a 
united 
player 
however 
if 
they 
play 
against 
each 
other 
i 
will 
have 
to

neutral

buck 
off 
This 
competition 
is 
becoming 
meaningless 
Take 
it 
easy 
that 
s 
why 
we 
are 
i 
understand 
the 
feeling 
of 
not 
being 
one 
of 
us 
Always 
hated 
but 
never 
ignored 
It 
was 
a 
beauty 
had 
no 
chance 
Nathan 
martial 
is 
not 
given 
enough 
playing 
time 
but 
he 
is 
a 
very 
good 
player 
almost 
the 
most 
talented 
in 
our 
club 
at 
the 
moment 
they 
can 
t 
bench 
him 
that 
much 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
expect 
a 
lot 
from 
him 
I 
m 
feeling 
headache 
already 
reading 
s 
transfer 
news 
hopping 
for 
the 
confirmation 
but 
all 
in 
vain 
What 
s 
the 
difference 
between 
that 
and 
goal 
against 
Liverpool 
loosed 
the 
game 
the 
moment 
was 
injured 
to 
compete 
next 
season 
they 
need 
another 
goal 
keeper 
Nathan 
it 
was 
nice 
to 
see 
them 
loose 
today 
but 
to 
be 
honest 
i 
t 
have 
supported 
Madrid 
if 
it 
t 
against 
Liverpool 
i 
had 
no 
choice 
because 
it 
was 
against 
Liverpool 
Now 
we 
t 
have 
any 
problem 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
transfers 
Where

We

not

I 
belie 
if 
warren 
Joyce 
was 
still 
at 
the 
club 
he 
would 
have 
got 
the 
node 
Let 
him 
leave 
already 
That 
is 
true 
i 
have 
been 
watching 
him 
closely 
i 
think 
his 
just 
against 
not 
even 
martial 
he 
wants 
him 
to 
quit 
Oh

emotional 
Sanchez 
played 
well 
however 
Jose 
wanted 
to 
give 
a 
point 
as 
a 
fan 
am 
not 
pleased 
with 
he 
had 
options 
on 
the 
bench 
its 
time 
for 
him 
to 
start 
respecting 
the 
club 
and 
fans 
That 
was 
a 
straight 
red 
card 
and 
i 
believe 
if 
it 
was 
a 
player 
believe 
me 
it 
was 
going 
to 
be 
a 
red 
card 
A 
very 
poor 
display 
Jose 
should 
have 
done 
better 
than 
that 
united 
fans 
deserve 
more 
he 
should 
have 
changed 
the 
system 
right 
after 
second 
half 
we 
had 
attacking 
players 
on 
the 
bench 
for 
Gods 
sake 
Sanchez 
and 
a 
clean 
sheet 
for 
Dave 
saves 
Speedy 
recovery

Get 
well 
soon

Team 
selection 
was 
another 
factor 
and 
fella 
can 
t 
work 
together 
was 
force 
to 
pull 
buck 
to 
defend 
rather 
than 
currying 
the 
ball 
forward 
so 
the 
front 
three 
had 
little 
services 
then 
another 
one 
was 
there 
is 
no 
word 
to 
describe 
his 
performance 
It 
was 
one 
of 
our 
worse 
performances 
of 
the 
season 
first 
of 
all 
is 
to 
take 
part 
of 
the 
blame 
he 
should 
have 
passed 
the 
ball 
for 
his 
colleague 
but 
no 
he 
t 
do 
that 
because 
he 
is 
mean 
and 
premature 
he 
thinks 
of 
himself 
not 
a 
team 
secondly 
our 
midfield 
was 
too 
sloppy 
That 
s 
nonsense 
you 
can 
t 
risk 
loosing 
important 
games 
by 
dropping 
your 
best 
defender 
because 
you 
want 
smalling 
and 
Jones 
to 
be 
in 
world 
cup 
That 
s 
nonsense 
we 
want 
premier

let 
me 
ask 
you 
a 
question 
can 
you 
choose 
between 
your 
self 
and 
your 
son 
or

Well 
deserved 
The 
only 
way 
he 
can 
pay 
back 
the 
love 
from

by

U 
This 
team 
is 
capable 
of 
scoring 
more 
than 
goals 
though 
i 
m 
not 
sure 
of 
clean 
sheet 
due 
to 
that 
with 
Smalling 
Jones 
and 
however 
am 
happy 
to 
see 
that 
front 
and 
shaw 
too 
I 
m 
one 
who 
believe 
that 
the 
treatment 
of 
shaw 
is 
not 
fair 
however 
it 
s 
a 
strong 
squad 
united 
Strong 
squad 
though 
i 
can 
t 
understand 
why 
Bailey 
is 
missing 
I 
would 
watch 
that 
ever 
and 
ever 
again 
it 
was 
unbelievable 
save 
thought 
it 
had 
gone 
inside 
so 
he 
was 
running 
to 
pick 
the 
ball 
thank 
you 
stay 
with 
us 
for 
long 
time 
No 
way 
i 
would 
NEVER 
consider 
even 
loaning 
any 
let 
alone 
even 
mentioning 
to 
sale 
Then 
there 
is 
greenwood 
scoring 
and 
assisting 
Great 
work 
by 
the

i 
like 
the 
way

his 
movements 
are 
similar 
to 
that 
of 
Sanchez 
and 
that 
goal 
by 
Ethan

was 
a 
beauty

love

Wow 
that 
goal 
by

That 
was

He 
should 
have 
scored 
another 
goal 
going 
one 
on

with 
the

Important

Lads
