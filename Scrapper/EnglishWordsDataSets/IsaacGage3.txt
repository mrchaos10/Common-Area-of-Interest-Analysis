The 
question 
of 
the

role 
of 
government 
in 
the 
economy 
is 
NOT 
whether 
the

debate 
was 
settled 
by

forms

ANY

company

otherwise 
is 
absolutely

This 
should 
be 
a 
chance

bipartisan 
compromise

logic 
is 
obvious

President 
Trump

it 
s 
going

happen

What 
is 
the 
institution 
that 
set 
those 
interest

The 
Federal 
Reserve 
A 
governmental 
central 
bank 
Communist 
based 
off 
the 
theories 
of 
Marx 
Nice 
try 
though 
It 
is 
clear 
you 
are 
going 
to 
remain 
entrenched 
in 
your 
Marxist 
orthodoxy 
and 
this 
conversation 
has 
long 
since 
ceased 
to 
be 
productive 
Good 
day 
sir 
hopefully 
one 
day 
you 
realize 
the 
error 
in 
your 
ways 
It 
is 
always 
government 
institutions 
and 
short 
sighted 
politicians 
that 
cause 
dysfunction 
in 
the 
economy 
Without 
question 
The 
day 
Nixon 
took 
the 
US 
off 
the 
gold 
standard 
was 
the 
day 
that 
any 
semblance 
of 
economic 
sanity 
disappeared 
The 
dollar 
was 
no 
longer 
tethered 
to 
anything 
tangible 
in 
the 
real 
world 
that 
could 
not 
be 
reproduced 
such 
as 
gold 
Hence 
the 
endless 
quantitative 
easing 
and 
inflation 
Right 
because 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
and 
it 
s 
fake 
money 
created 
out 
of 
thin 
air 
are 
instruments 
of 
the 
free 
market 
If 
you 
were 
capable 
of 
any 
kind 
of 
deep 
philosophical 
and 
intellectual 
thought 
you 
would 
understand 
this 
intuitively 
However 
clearly 
that 
is 
not 
the 
case 
Again 
I 
return 
to 
the 
I 
Pencil 
argument 
There 
is 
not 
one 
single 
person 
or 
small 
group 
of 
people 
intelligent 
enough 
to 
create 
a 
pencil 
It 
requires

of 
different 
economic 
actors

their

what 
happens

that

Socialists

control 
of 
the 
government 
and 
then 
institute 
short 
sighted 
policies 
that 
exacerbate

and 
bust 
cycles 
Rather

the

I 
invite 
you 
to 
move 
to 
a 
chronically 
impoverished 
country 
and 
see 
how 
long 
you 
last 
That 
technological 
innovation 
however 
is 
not 
going 
to 
come 
from 
a 
Socialist 
Politburo 
full 
of 
central 
planners 
and 
technocrats 
but 
from 
entrepreneurs 
operating 
in 
the 
free 
market 
for 
profit 
Once 
again 
facts 
do 
not 
care 
about 
your 
feelings 
As 
these 
countries 
begin 
to 
develop 
they 
are 
going 
to 
start 
polluting 
more 
China 
and 
India 
are 
good 
examples 
At 
that 
point 
hopefully 
technology 
will 
be 
such 
that 
most 
of 
the 
negative 
externalities 
of 
pollution 
can 
be 
mitigated 
effectively 
Those 
are 
chronically 
undeveloped 
countries 
and 
continents 
whose 
citizens 
live 
in 
abject 
poverty 
Pollution 
is 
a 
necessary 
trade 
off 
for 
affluence 
and 
economic 
well

If 
you 
are
