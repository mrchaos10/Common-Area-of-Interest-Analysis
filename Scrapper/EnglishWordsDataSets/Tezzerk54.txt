A 
fatal 
position 
for 
the 
Country 
With

think 
you

she 
really 
means 
is 
he

The 
rosy 
picture 
Theresa

paints 
by 
spouting 
employment 
figures 
t 
match 
the 
reality 
faced 
by 
working 
people 
I 
think 
it 
s 
appalling 
that 
he 
has 
able 
to 
pay 
the 
enormous 
fine 
of 
out 
of 
his 
reserves 
How 
has 
he 
ever 
been 
worth 
that 
much 
I 
guess 
it 
s 
by 
not 
paying 
the 
taxes 
that 
he 
should 
have 
Amazing 
how 
these

are 
always 
so 
quick 
to 
donate

actively

Suspicious 
in 
the

advantages 
of

EU 
he 
would 
deny 
the 
rest 
Maybe 
because 
the 
bigger 
issue 
is 
not 
his 
business 
advantages 
but 
the 
hypocrisy 
of 
his 
position 
Which 
highlights 
the 
fact 
that 
the

that

Lying
