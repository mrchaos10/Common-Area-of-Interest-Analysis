I 
think 
there 
s 
guilt 
that 
goes 
with 
not 
doing

re

think 
having 
a 
line 
manager 
assessment 
process

explicitly 
says 
this

make 
it 
much 
easier

You

After

I 
was

commented 
that

don 
t 
have 
the

hours

think 
this 
is 
a 
great 
example 
of 
that 
problem 
It 
is 
money 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
day

how 
can 
we 
give 
employers 
a 
framework 
that 
this 
counts 
for 
impact 
I 
been 
talking 
about 
this 
at 
the 
Turing

years 
People 
who 
hold 
the 
purse 
strings

success 
are 
willing

have 
to 
tell 
them 
what 
we 
want

it 
s 
hard 
for 
small

know

a 
similar 
thing 
for 
weekly 
meetings 
but 
I 
love 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
little 
bot 
that 
pulls 
specific 
topics 
into 
the 
agenda 
Whoever 
is 
responsible 
for 
these 
creative 
signs 
you 
rock 
t 
co 
One 
of 
the 
greatest 
skills 
I 
learned 
in 
my 
was 
taking 
minutes 
in 
meetings 
There 
s 
close 
to 
no 
use 
in 
transcribing 
everything 
that 
s 
said 
but 
a 
list 
of 
actions 
is 
Circulate 
them 
week 
before 
the 
next 
meeting 
and 
then 
that 
s 
your 
next 
agenda 
I 
m 
also 
a 
bit 
worried 
that 
I 
m 
about 
to 
introduce 
a 
lab 
meeting 
Which 
can 
be 
the 
ultimate 
status 
meeting 
that 
everyone 
hates 
In 
my 
defense 
the 
goal 
is 
to 
build 
connections 
between 
the 
different 
projects 
So 
hopefully 
not 
the 
ultimate 
in 
boring 
and 
a 
waste 
of 
time 
I 
have 
to 
say 
not 
postponing 
decisions 
is 
hard 
for 
me 
I 
find 
it 
hard 
to 
make 
important 
decisions 
without 
having 
the 
folks 
who 
have 
done 
the 
prep 
work 
there 
with 
me 
I 
do 
think 
the 
meeting 
can 
be 
small 
one 
person 
the 
discussion 
and 
can 
end 
early 
Meetings 
are 
a 
bit 
different 
in 
academia 
for 
good 
and 
for 
bad 
but 
I 
LOVE 
the 
focus 
on 
sharing 
the 
purpose 
of 
a 
meeting 
in 
advance

keeping 
meetings

Does 
this 
loop 
back 
to 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
conversation 
about 
needing 
a 
infrastructure 
If 
people 
t 
downloading 
data 
to 
their 
local 
machines 
Not 
Just 
noting 
how 
difficult 
this 
problem 
is 
to 
balance 
the 
different 
ethical 
challenges 
I 
think 
we 
agree 
that 
it 
would 
be 
really 
hard 
but 
I 
don 
t 
think 
it 
would 
be 
unsustainable 
It 
would 
mean 
a 
very 
different 
style 
of 
communication 
with 
the 
data 
owners 
participants 
though 
It 
would 
mean 
keeping 
them 
much 
better 
informed 
about 
opportunities 
than 
we 
currently 
do 
thanks 
Each 
participant 
owns 
their 
data 
I 
agree 
with 
you 
except 
that 
I 
d 
prefer 
to 
phrase 
it 
as 
the 
participants 
having 
control 
rather 
than 
the 
researcher 
Which 
is 
very 
close 
to 
the 
spirit 
of 
what 
you 
say 
but 
would 
be 
implemented 
very 
differently 
Its 
radical 
to 
actually 
put 
the 
data 
back 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
participant 
but 
potentially 
very 
very 
cool 
And 
I 
think 
it 
absolves 
the 
university 
from 
their 
responsibilities 
quite 
nicely 
I 
don 
t 
think 
universities 
want 
to 
own 
data 
I 
just 
think 
they 
dug 
themselves 
into 
a 
paternalistic 
hole 
and 
can 
t 
find 
an 
easy 
way 
out 
I 
don 
t 
personally 
think 
open 
is 
the 
way 
to 
go 
but 
this 
type 
of 
managed 
access 
BY 
THE 
DATA 
OWNER 
might 
be 
really 
awesome

about 
It 
s 
doing 
some 
really 
awesome 
work 
allowing 
people 
to 
upload 
their 
personal 
data 
and 
then 
release 
that 
for 
use 
by 
a 
bunch 
of 
research 
projects 
You 
could 
hypothetically 
say 
anyone 
can 
use 
it 
or 
you 
can 
have 
finer 
grained 
control

I 
m 
watching 
the

in

how

come 
up 
with 
governance 
solutions 
The 
peer 
to 
peer 
part 
is 
super 
tough 
if 
there 
s 
sensitive 
personal 
data 
but 
maybe 
not 
impossible 
and 
really 
really 
fantastic 
for 
maintaining 
datasets 
Propose 
a 
better 
one 
And 
then 
maintain 
that 
one 
And 
then 
convince 
the 
small 
c 
conservative 
university 
legal 
teams 
that 
this 
new 
system 
is 
better 
These 
t 
technical 
problems 
they 
re 
social 
And 
they 
re 
heavily 
reliant 
on 
better 
sustainability 
of 
alternative 
tools 
Yep 
sorry 
I 
was 
being 
really 
lazy 
not 
linking 
to 
that 
Open 
Brain 
Consent 
was 
absolutely 
the 
resource 
I 
was 
thinking 
of 
Just 
because 
your 
prof 
is 
a 
lady 
and 
nice 
and 
good 
at 
explaining 
things 
in 
simple 
terms 
does 
not 
mean 
she 
is 
technically 
The 
other 
point 
is 
managed 
access 
for 
more 
sensitive 
data 
I 
think 
there 
s 
quite 
a 
high 
risk 
of 
triangulation 
if 
questionnaire 
survey 
data 
is 
shared 
with 
brain 
imaging 
data 
So 
who 
is 
funding 
the 
infrastructure 
for 
managed 
access 
to 
accompany 
the 
open 
if 
possible 
imaging 
data 
Yes 
And 
I 
think 
standard 
text 
responses 
are 
a 
really 
valuable 
resource 
It 
s 
exhausting 
trying 
to 
convince 
committees 
legal 
teams 
to 
change

tried

One 
of 
the 
points 
of 
this 
thread 
is 
that 
this 
happens 
to 
everyone 
and 
it 
happens 
frequently 
It 
t 
say 
anything 
bad 
ab 
I 
m 
feeling 
burnt 
out 
and 
struggling 
to 
motivate 
today 
so 
I 
thought

through 
how 
I 
am 
trying

Yes 
I 
sometimes 
phrased 
this 
as 
people 
before 
us 
have 
done 
bad 
stuff 
so 
now 
we 
can 
t 
have 
nice 
things 
We 
have 
to 
build 
the 
trust 
back 
up 
even 
if 
an 
individual 
researcher 
has 
never 
done 
anything 
wrong 
I 
m 
not 
trying 
to 
be 
sanctimonious 
by 
the 
way 
I 
m 
trying 
to 
acknowledge 
that 
everyone 
is 
motivated 
for 
different 
reasons 
Which 
is 
why 
a 
battery 
of 
them 
is 
super 
helpful 
No 
point 
in 
trying 
to 
get 
everyone 
to 
think 
like 
me 
I 
completely 
agree 
with 
this 
And 
it 
t 
my 
personal 
motivation 
I 
subscribe 
to 
do 
no 
harm 
and 
I 
personally 
care 
about 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
work 
but 
this 
is 
a 
strong 
point 
that 
I 
used 
with 
others 
as 
a 
selfish 
long 
term 
reason 
to 
do 
ethical 
research 
Specific 
request 
from 
this 
researcher 
is 
that 
the 
ethics 
committee 
think 
about 
the 
ethical 
considerations 
I 
think 
this 
can 
t 
be 
as 
effective 
as 
getting 
the 
researchers 
to 
think 
about 
the 
consequences 
of 
their 
actions 
but 
that 
approach

worked

Managers 
tend 
to 
channel 
black 
workers 
into 
the 
least 
secure 
and 
least 
prestigious 
jobs 
What 
I 
mean 
by 
not 
using 
issues 
is 
the 
use 
of 
them 
as 
a 
project 
management 
tool 
or 
a 
place 
to 
have 
discussions 
and 
get 
feedback 
Most 
folks 
think 
of 
them 
only 
for 
bugs 
I 
think 
you 
re 
missing 
some 
functionality 
if 
you 
only 
use 
issues 
for 
bugs 
but 
that 
s 
a 
lab 
decision 
My 
other 
big 
recommendation 
is 
to 
remember 
that 
git 
and 
are 
very 
different 
skill 
sets 
I 
know 
lots 
of 
people 
who 
are 
git 
wizards 
but 
don 
t 
know 
how 
to 
do 
a 
pull 
request 
and 
don 
t 
use 
issues 
So 
train 
for 
both 
skills 
The 
number 
of 
notifications 
is 
really 
tough 
So 
keep 
having 
lots 
of 
conversations 
about 
how 
to 
best 
communicate 
There 
are 
options 
to 
manage 
notifications 
but 
they 
require 
some 
common 
ways 
of 
working 
knowing 
when 
to 
tag 
etc 
that 
only 
humans 
can 
determine 
My 
philosophy 
is 
to 
focus 
on 
the 
in 
lab 
training 
and 
build 
up 
confidence 
so 
they 
can 
make 
later 
projects 
open 
if 
they

The

chapter 
is 
about 
the

Britain 
It 
s 
quite 
different 
to 
the 
history 
in 
the

for 
a 
few

reasons

that

motivation

should 
have 
the

a 
couple 
of

One 
in 
Manchester 
and 
one 
in 
London 
When 
you 
were 
discussing 
binder 
what 
was 
it 
that 
made 
you 
want 
to 
use 
it 
I 
have 
my 
ideas 
I 
m 
just 
curious 
as 
to 
what 
folks 
said 
in 
lab 
meeting 
This 
is 
supposed 
to

hey

early 
career 
researchers 
Please 
My 
feeling 
is 
that 
most 
folks 
in 
academia 
weigh 
teaching 
higher 
than 
invited 
talks 
and 
service 
so 
if 
you 
can 
make 
a 
good 
case 
that 
it 
was 
truly 
a 
pedagogical 
exercise 
not 
just 
a 
demo 
or 
a 
research 
presentation 
I 
d 
go 
for 
teaching 
And 
adding 
having 
read 
another 
reply 
if 
you 
don 
t 
give 
many 
talks 
then 
invited 
talks 
I 
think 
it 
depends 
on 
a 
who 
is 
reading 
your 
CV 
what 
the 
job 
requires 
and 
b 
where 
you 
have 
the 
least 
content 
If 
you 
don 
t 
have 
much 
teaching 
experience 
then 
put 
it 
there 
if 
you 
don 
t 
have 
much 
service 
then 
there 
Awesome

Would 
you 
mind 
please 
replying 
to 
the 
discourse 
post 
I 
think 
that 
makes 
sense 
as 
the 
best 
place 
to 
coordinate 
at 
least 
at 
this 
early 
stage 
YES 
This 
is 
great 
I 
had 
only 
thought 
about 
print 
as 
a 
v 
common 
difference 
between 
amp 
I 
was 
kinda 
hoping 
for 
package 
differences 
because 
I 
think 
they 
re 
a 
bit 
more 
subtle 
and 
therefore 
easier 
to 
miss 
But 
this 
is 
a 
very 
nice 
one 
that 
s 
ALSO 
hard 
to 
notice 
Anyone 
want 
to 
help

EVERYONE 
IS 
SO 
LOVELY 
So 
NOPE 
or 
similar 
error 
message 
is 
very 
easy 
to 
do 
but 
it 
might 
be 
more 
fun 
to 
see 
how 
code 
still 
RUNS 
but 
gives 
you 
different 
answers 
the 
goal 
is 
to 
build 
a 
tutorial 
where 
we 
tell 
people 
to 
change 
the 
package 
version 
in 
the 
requirements 
file 
and 
then 
see 
the 
different 
answers 
in 
their 
binder 
notebook 
You 
can 
only 
have 
collaborators 
on 
those 
private 
repositories 
So 
its 
not 
as 
good 
as 
the 
educational 
discount 
No 
need 
to 
be 
fully 
open 
if 
you 
re 
not 
comfortable 
doing 
so 
Totally 
fine 
to 
have 
a 
little

ramp 
to 
your 
working 
open 
lifestyle

the 
big 
problems 
come

most

more

An

understanding 
of 
Autism

the

This 
is 
difficult 
to 
show 
on

there 
are 
SO 
MANY 
WAYS 
you

tell

about

THAT 
STORY 
On 
the 
other 
hand 
if 
your 
cover 
letter 
is 
more 
than 
pages 
I 
m 
going 
to 
be 
suspicious

a

of

you 
CAN

don

long

be

good

nothing 
I

some 
thoughts 
about

so 
important

your 
points

the

slightly 
badly

have 
confidence

highly 
recommend

give 
a 
talk 
live 
Introducing 
himself 
you 
might 
think 
only 
nice 
people 
care 
about 
reproducibility 
but 
I 
m 
not 
a 
nice 
person 
amp 
I 
care 
Long 
story 
short 
if 
a 
professional 
society 
states 
that 
they 
haven 
t 
received 
any 
official 
harassment 
reports 
or 
numbers 
I 
m 
also 
a 
big 
fan 
of 
managed 
access 
for 
human 
data 
for 
mostly 
ethical 
and 
partially 
reporting 
reasons 
but 
that 
s 
kinda 
a 
different 
topic 
In 
sum 
CC 
is 
most 
correct 
but 
I 
think 
CC 
BY 
is 
a 
very 
very 
good 
stepping 
stone 
if 
you 
are 
feeling 
more 
anxious 
about 
getting 
some 
credit 
for 
your 
hard 
curated 
amp 
collected 
data 
Also 
strong 
endorsement 
for 
Things 
are 
going 
to 
be 
confusing 
for 
a 
while 
Having 
said 
that 
there 
s 
nothing 
I 
disagree 
with 
in 
the 
blog 
post 
They 
make 
a 
totally 
logical 
argument 
about 
the 
legal 
position 
and 
that 
cheaters 
gonna 
cheat 
I 
don 
t 
feel 
the 
same 
confidence 
that 
scholarly 
norms 
will 
lead 
to 
citations 
but 
I 
d 
love 
to 
be 
wrong 
So 
most 
advocates 
recommend 
CC 
because 
the 
data 
t 
BELONG 
to 
the 
curator 
and 
it 
reuse 
as 
said 
in 
the 
blog 
I 
personally 
like 
CC 
BY 
because 
I 
think 
people 
don 
t 
know 
HOW 
to 
credit 
data 
and 
I 
like 
the 
nudge 
to 
include 
some 
attribution

information 
I

Super 
happy 
to 
answer 
any 
questions 
and 
I 
do 
think 
this 
is 
a 
big 
chunk 
of 
REALLY 
VALUABLE 
work 
Just 
think 
of 
the 
impact 
we 
can 
have 
on 
tech 
if 
we 
show 
that 
individuals 
being 
informed 
and 
empowered 
to 
manage 
their 
own 
data 
can 
be 
done 
t 
co 
ea 
My 
personal 
gut 
feeling 
is 
that 
this 
will 
be 
a 
lot 
of 
thinking 
and 
stakeholder 
engagement 
work 
but 
I 
m 
quite 
confident 
that 
much 
of 
the 
technical 
components 
have 
already 
been 
developed 
I 
just 
don 
t 
think 
they 
all 
been 
incorporated 
into 
a 
project 
like 
this 
one 
before 
There 
are 
great 
teams 
who 
are 
already 
thinking 
about 
these 
sorts 
of 
data 
control 
models 
in 
particular 
have 
already 
reached 
out 
about 
working 
with 
them 
to 
build 
a 
first 
version 
Regarding 
question 
about 
how 
much 
work 
this 
is 
There 
are 
two 
answers 
It 
will 
take 
time 
The 
project 
is 
participatory 
so 
it 
will 
be 
designed 
and 
built 
with 
our 
Autistic 
collaborators 
We 
ll 
iterate 
with 
them 
on 
what 
needs 
to 
be 
built 
SO 
we 
need 
a 
fine 
grained 
consent 
model 
Every 
individual 
contributor 
needs 
to 
be 
able 
to 
have 
complete 
control 
over 
their 
data 
They 
t 
going 
to 
be 
signing 
up 
for 
some 
generic 
T 
amp 
Cs 
and 
losing 
sight 
of 
what 
s 
happening 
We 
ll 
also 
maintain 
the 
database 
to 
be 
FAIR 
under 
managed 
access 
Maybe 
other 
researchers 
would 
like 
to 
better 
understand 
Autism 
from 
the 
data 
Some 
Autistic 
contributors 
will 
want 
to 
take 
part 
in 
that 
work 
others 
may 
not 
BUT 
another 
goal 
is 
to 
build 
a 
database 
that 
can 
be 
used 
for 
research 
purposes 
Maybe 
we 
can 
run 
the 
stories 
through 
an 
natural 
language 
processing 
algorithm 
to 
cluster 
them 
together 
Some 
contributors 
will 
be 
with 
that 
Others 
would 
prefer 
not 
One 
of 
the 
goals 
of 
the 
project 
is 
to 
build 
community 
between 
Autistic 
people 
Ideally 
they 
ll 
feel 
a 
little 
less 
alone 
in 
these 
challenges 
share 
coping 
strategies 
amp 
support 
each 
other 
A 
might 
be 
totally 
fine 
with 
sharing 
their 
stories 
for 
that 
purpose 
But 
you 
could 
imagine 
a 
different 
example 
that 
was 
outside 
someone 
s 
house 
where 
they 
re 
happy 
to 
upload 
the 
story 
for 
researchers 
to 
use 
to 
understand 
Autistic 
people 
s 
experiences 
but 
they 
don 
t 
want 
to 
it 
to 
be 
public 
You 
can 
imagine 
someone 
uploading 
an 
experience 
that 
is 
general 
enough 
that 
they 
re 
happy 
to 
make 
totally 
public

In 
this 
project 
we 
ll 
be 
collecting 
experiences 
about 
the 
challenges 
that 
Autistic 
people 
have 
when 
navigate 
the 
environment

example 
is 
it 
very 
stressful

bad 
Yes

are

workarounds 
What 
do

by

fine 
grained 
consent 
model 
At 
the 
highest 
level 
it 
s 
pretty 
simple 
it 
means 
I 
want 
to 
give 
all 
the

control

role 
I 
m 
mega 
happy 
that 
you 
re 
starting 
a 
PhD 
that 
fits 
all 
your 
requirements 
As 
you 
can

if 
you 
missed 
this 
thread 
before 
Christmas 
about 
why

this 
participatory 
project 
please 
check 
it 
out 
AND

EVERYONE 
YOU 
KNOW 
about 
the

a

tomorrow 
about

the 
Community 
we 
ll 
need 
in 
the 
project 
That 
s 
definitely 
the 
BIGGEST 
focus 
for 
me 
So 
much 
more 
so 
than 
the 
skills 
or 
previous 
academic 
job 
experience 
There 
s 
NO 
reason 
why 
you 
can 
t 
have 
those 
skills 
from 
outside 
academia 
Please 
do 
not 
let 
the 
PhD 
requirement 
stop 
you 
from 
applying 
The 
post 
is 
probably 
not 
suitable 
for 
someone 
just 
out 
of 
undergrad 
but 
never 
say 
never 
Who 
know 
s 
what 
path 
you 
taken 
to 
get 
there 
BUT 
You 
do 
not 
have 
to 
have 
a 
PhD 
to 
these 
requirements 
You 
will 
need 
evidence 
of 
independent 
leadership 
of 
a 
project 
or 
of 
a 
team 
of 
looking 
for 
solutions 
to 
problems 
sometimes 
of 
your 
own 
and 
of 
communicating 
what 
you 
learned 
and 
what 
you 
created 
Not 
all 
doctoral 
provide 
that 
opportunity 
but 
many 
do 
And 
so 
the 
point 
of 
requiring 
a 
PhD 
for 
this 
job 
is 
that 
the 
post 
holder 
needs 
to 
be 
able 
to 
see 
or 
create 
a 
path 
to 
building 
that 
new 
knowledge 
and 
that 
s 
one 
of 
the 
key 
outcomes 
of 
a 
PhD 
in 
my 
opinion 
And 
I 
think 
the 
outcome 
of 
that 
is 
that 
you 
can 
generate 
NEW 
knowledge 
by 
the 
end 
I 
don 
t 
think 
this 
means 
significant 
results 
Nor 
expanding 
a 
theory 
Nor 
a 
new 
method 
I 
think 
it 
means 
contributing 
to 
making 
the 
world 
a 
better 
place 
by 
adding 
useful 
information 
I 
think 
a 
PhD 
should 
teach 
you 
to 
be 
an 
independent 
thinker 
I 
think 
you 
should 
have 
time 
and 
space 
to 
breathe 
and 
read 
and 
learn 
and 
digest 
the 
knowledge 
around 
you 
Every 
PhD 
is 
different 
and 
I 
got 
mine 
in 
the 
US 
Go 
Bears 
which 
is 
very 
different 
to 
the 
UK 
so 
the 
following 
opinions 
are 
mine 
only 
Everyone 
else 
s 
mileage 
will 
vary 
although 
maybe 
we 
SHOULD 
give 
academic 
credit 
for 
that 
work 
Let

Being 
able 
to 
ASK 
THE 
RIGHT 
QUESTIONS 
sorry 
for 
shouting 
is 
BY 
FAR 
the 
most 
important 
skill 
Some 
understanding 
of 
what 
goes 
into 
a 
web 
based 
platform 
website 
or 
maybe 
a 
web 
or 
a 
mobile 
is 
needed 
at 
the 
start 
But 
asking 
the 
right 
questions 
is 
the 
key 
skill 
This

what

telling

today

that 
you 
don

NEED 
TO 
HAVE 
ALL 
THESE 
SKILLS 
ALREADY 
All 
you 
have 
to 
do 
is 
convince 
me 
in 
your 
cover 
letter

interview 
that 
you 
COULD 
build 
up 
enough 
of 
the 
skills 
to 
build

and

of

THANK

thank

really 
appreciate 
the

you

I 
so 
hope 
you 
ll 
all 
be 
able 
to 
help 
us 
build 
a 
fantastic 
project 
together 
The 
project 
with 
and 
was 
heavily 
inspired 
by 
my 
desire 
to 
educate 
non 
autistic 
people 
about 
the 
little 
things 
they 
could 
do 
to 
make 
the 
anxiety 
and 
stress 
that 
autistic 
people 
feel 
when 
navigating 
the 
world 
just 
that 
little 
bit 
lighter 
What 
I 
love 
about 
this 
is 
that 
it 
costs 
me 
someone 
with 
typical 
hearing 
acuity 
and 
no 
sensory 
processing 
difficulties 
absolutely 
NOTHING 
to 
do 
this 
And 
it 
potentially 
helps 
so 
many 
people 
in 
the 
room 
Not 
just 
autistic 
people 
Anyone 
who 
struggles 
w 
hearing 
will 
benefit 
I 
remember 
saying 
just 
when 
you 
re 
talking 
Even 
if 
you 
can 
hear 
just 
fine 
there 
might 
be 
someone 
like 
them 
in 
the 
room 
who 
finds 
it 
much 
easier 
to 
follow 
your 
question 
if 
you 
wait 
seconds

someone 
to

that

what
