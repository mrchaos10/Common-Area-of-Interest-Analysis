Yes

Huge 
addition 
for 
th 
The 
day 
the 
ruined 
the 
league 
That 
is 
ridiculous 
He 
s 
been 
balling 
all 
season 
I 
understand 
it 
s 
s 
business 
but 
it 
s 
so 
bullshit 
at 
times 
k 
Yeah 
so 
much 
respect 
for 
knocking 
over 
his 
own 
teammate 
and 
not 
helping 
him 
up 
I 
t 
have 
early 
access 
It 
s 
just 
a 
glitch 
They 
tweeted 
about 
it 
Yes 
u 
that 
right 
EA 
actually 
communicated 
with 
the 
community 
I 
seen 
people 
saying 
They 
been 
hacked 
that 
s 
what 
they 
become 
Literally 
me 
every 
day 
It 
was 
the 
team 
on 
the 
left 
my 
friend 
read 
this 
gave 
me 
a 
bad 
headache 
Spot 
on 
Even 
though 
the 
non 
haters 
also 
haven 
t 
experienced 
it 
we 
have 
some 
logic 
and 
can 
understand 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
guy 
had 
no 
ankle 
a 
year 
ago 
and 
t 
play 
on 
for 
near 
enough 
whole 
year 
Anyone 
with 
eyes 
should 
that 
We 
can 
all 
see 
how 
pg 
is 
balling 
now 
Man 
where 
Shams 
Haynes 
at 
Avoiding 
the 
point 
So 
tell 
me 
that 
if 
did 
that 
same 
stamp 
to 
you 
d 
say 
it 
was 
an 
accident 
Yeah 
bore 
off 
with 
the 
delusion 
villa 
fans 
How 
stupid 
do 
u 
have 
to 
be 
to 
think 
that 
Delusion 
at 
its 
finest 
Love 
to 
see 
opinion 
if 
that 
was 
who 
did 
the 
same 
to 
m 
Course 
u 
do 
u 
dirty 
animal 
No 
one 
ever 
wants 
to 
see 
u 
grace 
a 
football 
pitch 
again 
Embarrassment 
to 
for 
even 
having 
the 
nerve 
to 
make 
out 
as 
if 
u 
t 
mean 
it 
We 
haven 
t 
forgot 
the 
one 
either 
Most 
tweet 
you 
ll 
see 
So 
many 
examples 
from 
not 
just 
football 
that 
I 
could 
use 
to 
prove 
why 
that 
s 
delusional

Ah 
Nice

How 
do 
u 
do 
that 
first 
skill 
with 
Rob 
Can 
t 
say 
I 
agreed 
with 
that 
but 
it 
s 
not 
like 
they 
threw 
coins 
at 
him 
and 
stuff 
like 
that 
Just 
a 
few 
harmless 
boos 
They 
have 
their 
reasons 
I 
guess 
Why 
Who 
cares 
about 
that 
on 
a 
day 
like 
this 
We 
all 
know 
this 
was 
about 
the 
occasion 
and 
not 
crying 
about 
decisions 
Great 
club 
and 
set 
of 
fans 
Had 
tears 
at 
the 
end 
there 
listening 
to 
that 
song 
Solid 
t 
co 
Christ 
happy 
about 
that 
one 
Sounds 
like 
heart

might 
need 
a 
little 
check 
pal 
What 
overall 
would 
his 
go 
to 
Nice 
way 
of 
twisting 
his 
words 
I 
m 
pretty 
sure 
he 
said 
he 
plans 
on 
re 
signing 
Shit 
happens 
in 
the 
There 
s 
so 
much 
controversy 
and 
twists 
so 
he 
s 
not 
gonna 
come 
and 
say 
he 
s 
definitely 
re 
signing 
is 
he 
Still 
gotta 
win 
the 
lottery 
Not 
fully 
sure 
how 
it 
works 
but 
don 
t 
get 
gassed 
when 
it 
s 
not 
as 
simple 
as

only 
just 
saw 
this 
Don 
t 
get 
me 
wrong 
he 
broke 
his 
leg 
but 
s 
challenge 
had 
a 
different 
intent 
to 
it 
Stick 
to 
old 
team 
Chelsea 
Nice 
at 
the 
end 
there 
Seems 
like 
being 
sarcastic 
no 
So 
we 
can 
keep 
watching 
unable 
to 
move 
or 
stay 
on 
his 
feet 
and 
get 
bullied 
by 
every 
striker 
Yes 
his 
passing 
and 
technical 
ability 
might 
be 
the 
worst 
we 
ever 
seen 
but 
have 
a 
bit 
of 
respect 
and 
appreciate 
that 
his 
presence 
is 
missing 
and 
he 
is 
needed 
right 
now 
Today 
just 
got 
a 
whole 
lot 
better 
Just 
an 
elite 
mentality 
Says 
it 
how 
it 
is 
which 
is 
something 
brad 
Stevens 
is 
lacking 
but 
he 
s 
young 
so 
will 
become 
more 
strict 
and 
that 
will 
help 
him 
become 
a 
better 
coach 
Have 
u 
tried 
Worth 
getting 
instead 
of 
considering 
I 
have 
most 
of 
the 
Yeah 
I 
just 
played 
rivals 
and 
it 
is 
slower 
than 
usual 
and 
that 
s 
saying 
something 
Every 
pass 
took 
an 
hour 
to 
get 
to 
the 
player 
Cheers 
Yes 
lad 
Not 
that 
I 
agree 
he 
should 
be 
a 
starter 
but 
they 
say 
trade 
him 
for 
a 
reason 
So 
inconsistent 
In 
fact 
he 
s 
pretty 
consistent 
at 
being 
awful 
Not 
quite 
pal 
When 
do 
the 
transfer 
cards 
come 
out 
OB 
Y 
Missing 
the 
point 
but 
Yeah 
that 
is 
a 
weakness 
that 
I 
m 
sure 
most 
teams 
will 
exploit 
What 
d 
he 
do 
Can 
t 
remember 
He 
is 
right 
footed 
tho 
so 
that 
s 
a 
bit 
annoying 
as 
I 
have 
at 
so 
t 
replace 
him 
U 
reckon 
goal 
as 
a 
is 
enough 
Don 
t 
know 
whether 
to 
sell 
my 
for 
profit 
How 
s 
at 
LB 
tempted 
to 
try 
him 
Alex 
Not 
a 
real 
assist 
Don 
t 
think 
it 
ll 
be 
enough 
unfortunately 
Came 
on 
at 
and 
scored 
so 
Yeah 
true 
But 
I 
feel 
that 
they 
need 
to 
do 
everything 
they 
can 
to 
find 
them 
alive 
or 
not 
cos 
their 
families 
surely 
can 
t 
live 
on 
not 
knowing 
if 
he 
s 
alive 
or 
not 
How 
d 
u 
know 
where 
they 
crashed 
Is 
it 
confirmed 
Oh 
he 
did 
don 
t 
worry 
Oh 
t 
agree 
more 
What 
s 
Disappointing 
from 
but 
Novak 
was 
filthy 
But 
with 
the 
addition 
of 
a 
healthy 
boogie 
there

too 
many 
options 
In 
other 
words 
no 
one 
is 
beating 
this 
team 
times 
out 
of 
Unfortunately 
I 
just 
can 
t 
see 
it 
unless 
or 
get 
injured 
I 
remember 
during 
a 
game 
earlier 
this 
season 
the 
reporter 
asked 
like 
how 
are 
u 
gonna 
get 
going 
and 
he 
literally 
said 
he 
t 
even 
run 
the 
plays 
anymore 
What 
a 
tough 
job 
he 
must 
have 
And 
a 
clean 
sheet 
Surely 
enough 
for 
a 
defender 
Even

going 
in

How 
d

no

It

it 
must 
be 
for

is

have 
a 
massive 
head 
He 
literally 
just 
said 
that 
Wow 
I 
don 
t 
see 
that 
stopping 
until 
or 
are 
back 
What 
s 
the 
record 
Well 
they 
showed 
that 
they 
could 
cope 
for 
most 
of 
the 
last 
playoffs 
But 
that 
was 
when 
they 
were 
playing 
with 
heart 
and 
not 
selfish 
ball 
But 
despite 
the 
playoff 
run 
obviously 
is 
needed 
Get 
back 
It 
baffles 
me 
y 
he 
takes 
so 
long 
I 
feel 
like 
he 
only 
takes 
a 
TO 
when 
he 
sees 
something 
wrong 
but 
surely 
it 
s 
common 
sense 
to 
call 
one 
when 
the 
other 
team 
is 
on 
a 
run 
to 
stop 
the 
momentum 
and 
regroup 
Wyatt 
but 
I 
feel 
ya 
Why 
would 
people 
say 
that 
after 
an 
L 
where 
they 
evidently 
t 
Probably 
just 
more 
stuff 
in 
packs 
to 
give 
them 
that 
dollar 
Hopefully 
I 
m 
wrong 
tho 
Jamie 
shuts 
down 
Graeme 
for 
his 
continued 
agenda 
against 
Finally 
someone 
has 
done 
it 
t 
Y 
would 
u 
post 
a 
quote 
that 
old 
That 
second 
laugh 
was 
too 
much 
R 
Oh 
yeah 
I 
ll 
just 
sell 
walker 
and 
as 
they 
play 
for 
rivals 
If 
I 
was 
a 
pro 
footballer 
then 
I 
d 
be 
rich 
B 
I 
G 
W 
I 
N 
t 
co 
We 
wish 
t 
co 
I 
don 
t 
get 
how 
u 
can 
be 
blessed 
to 
play 
in 
the 
best 
league 
in 
the 
world 
and 
not 
play 
hard 
enough 
It 
s 
a 
ridiculous 
excuse 
Unless 
there 
s 
an 
actual 
good 
reason 
they 
t 
playing 
hard 
Why 
would 
TD 
not 
be 
in 
in 
the 
first 
place 
That 
was 
TD 
I 
m 
guessing 
No 
he 
just 
wants 
the 
players 
to 
follow 
simple 
instructions 
Gordon 
u 
pass 
to 
Al 
Al 
u 
do 
a 
dribble 
hand 
off 
to 
Simple 
no 
Not 
even 
surprised 
at 
this 
point 
I 
missed 
most 
of 
the 
game 
Let 
me 
guess 
all 
misses 
were 
heavily 
contested 
shots 
while 
falling 
back 
Yeah 
maybe 
try 
and 
trade 
for 
that 
rookie 
called 
rob 
Williams 
I 
m 
sure 
he 
d 
be 
a 
great 
addition 
R 
Oh 
yeah 
I 
don 
t 
think 
it 
s 
bad 
if 
it 
s 
part 
of 
job 
but 
if 
it 
s 
not 
then 
I 
don 
t 
see 
the 
point 
R 
I 
like 
the 
optimism 
but 
that 
t 
it 
chief 
And 
a 
pair 
of 
lungs 
if 
we 
re 
lucky 
R 
What 
goes 
through 
head 
to 
get 
to 
spend 
on 
packs 
that 
we 
all 
know 
are 
not 
gonna 
pay 
out 
Remember 
when 
and 
said 
we 
got 
our 
Arsenal 
back 
wonder 
what 
they 
think 
now 
CR 
FUT 
His 
shot 
power 
and 
finishing 
is 
on 
a 
different 
planet 
If 
u 
can 
aim 
fairly 
well 
then 
he 
ll 
bag 
goals 
I 
use 
him 
as 
a 
super 
sub 
cos 
of 
links 
Just 
looks 
freezing 
For 
which 
player 
if 
any 
do 
u 
base 
your 
game 
around 
Just 
keep 
doing 
league 
upgrades 
and 
then 
put 
all 
the 
non 
rares 
from 
those 
packs 
into 
gold 
upgrades 
Keep 
repeating 
basically 
Yeah 
he 
does 
feel 
like 
a 
bit 
of 
a 
truck 
that 
t 
moved 
in 
about 
years 
At 
least 
his 
agility 
s 
More 
important 
than 
balance 
They 
haven 
t 
even 
done 
yet 
for 
some 
reason 
He 
does 
a 
have 
a 
fixed 
position 
but 
he 
t 
got 
to 
play 
there 
in 
about 
years 
Maybe 
you 
forgotten 
then 
spurs 
All 
star 
game 
came 
early 
WHAT 
A 
GAME 
The 
spurs 
escape 
with 
the 
OT 
win 
over 
the 
Thunder 
t 
co 
It 
depends 
on 
what 
it 
s 
about 
If 
it 
was 
just 
about 
a 
certain 
play 
then 
not 
but 
I 
have 
a 
feeling 
it 
might 
have 
been 
bigger 
than 
that 
I 
don 
t 
get 
why 
people 
complain 
about 
duplicates 
Heard 
of 
s 
on 
the 
glitch 
Just 
wanna 
know 
what 
it 
s 
about 
Yeah 
negatively

was

Please 
brad

the 
guy 
more 
Start 
him 
with 
at 
the 
can 
then 
bring 
his 
consistency 
and 
energy 
from 
the 
bench 
Surely 
it 
s 
worth 
a 
try 
He 
has 
a 
habit 
of 
putting 
up 
bricks 
Never 
makes 
them 
for 
That 
s 
rough 
Personal 
preference 
I 
guess 
I 
sold 
cos 
I 
just 
t 
use 
a 
player 
that 
small 
As 
good 
as 
I 
know 
he 
would 
be

extreme 
but 
I 
feel 
ya 
These

Yeah 
that 
s 
what 
I 
meant 
The

only 
for

I

need 
anyway 
We 
need

But 
he 
t 
I 
like 
the

unfortunately 
I 
don 
t 
agree 
Maybe 
fut 
swap

that 
s

People 
who 
saved 
their 
player 
picks 
are 
getting 
some 
of 
the 
people 
who 
have 
been 
predicted 
to 
be 
in 
this 
Why 
are 
they 
mixed 
up 
ea 
are 
a 
mess 
Yeah 
t 
put 
it 
better 
Don 
t 
get 
me 
wrong 
it 
s 
disappointing 
to 
see 
this 
team 
struggle 
so 
far 
but 
the 
way 
people 
are 
turning 
on 
the 
players 
is 
laughable 
There 
s 
still 
a 
trade 
deadline 
and 
games 
to 
sort 
this 
out 
U 
just 
named 
half 
of 
the 
rotation 
Harden 
out 
here 
with 
while 
the 
Celtics 
struggle 
to 
get 
half 
of 
that 
in 
a 
game 
I 
think 
it 
s 
a 
mix 
of 
shit 
refs 
and 
the 
Celtics 
being 
non 
aggressive 
Wow 
That 
s 
quite 
a 
lot 
of 
years 
He 
s 
averaging 
points 
so 
do 
research 
my 
friend 
The 
problem 
is 
that 
he 
just 
looks 
off 
it 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
way 
he 
s 
playing 
and 
that 
he 
t 
look 
like 
he 
believes 
he 
s 
gonna 
make 
the 
shots 
Must 
be 
a 
mental 
thing 
But 
we 
lost 
he 
s 
had 
about 
good 
games 
That 
is 
rough 
points 
What 
did 
I 
just 
watch 
True 
I 
was 
thinking 
a 
silver 
injury 
card 
but 
what 
ever 
floats 
boat 
Not 
ridiculous 
requirements 
for 
nearly 
every 
decent 
and 
actual 
daily 
s 
which 
they 
falsely 
advertised 
Not 
much 
to 
ask 
for 
right 
spurs 
Give 
him 
a 
contract 
please 
Henderson 
to 
gift 
the 
title 
to 
city 
Did 
it 
genuinely 
say 
daily 
s 
Cos 
that 
s 
false 
advertising 
so 
we 
should 
all 
complain 
SF 
Bit 
generous 
g 
a 
is 
enough 
It 
s 
just 
they 
barely 
ever 
done 
it 
before 
Reckon 
it 
s 
possible 
for 
b 
b 
informs 
This 
has 
a 
like 
let 
alone 
Any 
Liverpool 
fan 
would 
say 
and 
any 
United 
fan 
would 
say 
Simple 
Watch 
it 
again 
It 
s 
hard 
to 
see 
but 
I 
m 
pretty 
sure 
his 
foot 
got 
clipped 
Also 
when 
do 
u 
ever 
see 
Kane 
complain 
the 
way 
he 
did 
If 
not 
sure 
there 
are 
the 
little 
things 
like 
that 
which 
help 
to 
tell 
if 
it 
was 
a 
dive 
or 
not 
Ur 
a 
beast 
but 
chill 
and 
have 
a 
bit 
of 
discipline 
mate 
s 
rise 
is 
incredible 
Looks 
like 
you 
never 
touched 
in 
life 
and 
who 
else 
Oh 
yeah 
it 
s 
not 
about 
games 
to 
goal 
ratio 
so 
he 
t 
deserve 
it 
but 
just 
letting 
u 
know 
hated 
him 
so 
he 
t 
play 
He 
literally 
played 
minutes 
out 
of 
the 
other 
games 
so 
do 
your 
research 
Bjorn 
pal 
That 
s 
irrelevant 
My 
point 
is 
why 
would 
anyone 
randomly 
face 
time 
someone 
they 
don 
t 
even 
know 
Why 
would 
he 
even 
answer 
a 
face 
time 
from 
a 
fan 
Liverpool 
Wolves 
Enjoy 
hazard 
while 
it 
lasts 
Oh 
so 
a 
bad 
run 
of 
form 
t 
allowed 
U 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
haters 
just 
have 
a 
bit 
of 
patience 
Says 
who 
A 
shot 
every 
They 
just 
fell 
asleep 
seconds 
is 
clearly 
enough 
time 
to 
get 
a 
decent 
look 
Well 
at 
least 
that 
s 
a 
positive 
in 
that 
he 
s 
been 
awful 
But 
why 
has 
he 
been 
playing 
then 
A 
slump 
t 
a 
whole 
season 
pal 
Not 
sure 
what 
your 
watching 
then 
Stick 
to 
maybe 
It 
s 
funny 
how 
and 
smart 
can 
adjust 
fine 
to 
being 
a 
starter 
and 
bench 
player 
Because 
they 
re 
established 
players 
with 
much 
better 
IQ 
Don 
t 
get 
me 
wrong 
he 
s 
young 
and 
got 
some 
talent 
but 
his 
is 
down 
there 
with 
the 
worst 
Or 
more 
like 
u 
need 
to 
that 
maybe 
he 
s 
just 
not 
good 
enough 
especially 
with 
better 
players 
around 
him 
I 
mean 
if 
someone 
thinks 
having 
decent 
game 
is 
acceptable 
then 
I 
think 
we 
know 
who 
actually 
watches 
the 
games 
properly 
Yeah 
how 
did 
u 
know 
open 
your 
eyes 
and 
he 
s 
been 
awful 
of 
the 
season 
U 
probably 
think 
he 
s 
been 
better 
than 
u 
seem 
that 
deluded 
He 
was 
decent 
enough 
but 
this 
is 
like 
a 
in 
occurrence 
There 
s 
a 
reason 
why 
I 
can 
assure 
u 
that 
u 
don 
t 
often 
have 
these 
debates 
Cos 
he 
t 
give 
u 
a 
performance 
that 
deserves 
backing 
up 
with 
shots 
and 
ft 
and 
harden 
with 
shots 
and 
ft 
Sometimes 
brad 
needs 
to 
just 
forget 
plays 
and 
let 
go 
cos 
that 
t 
enough 
shots 
for 
a 
superstar 
The 
bench 
is 
now 
officially 
shit 
Time 
lord 
and 
needed 
from 
the 
bench 
Those 
calls 
were 
actually 
hurting 
me 
I 
t 
even 
tell

I

what

this

why

so 
excited 
They 
just 
either 
release 
nothing

stuff 
that 
s 
underwhelming

overpriced 
they 
should 
have 
just 
replaced 
one 
of 
the

squads 
with 
a 
special 
requirement 
and 
then 
it 
d

U

well 
the 
rest 
is 
history 
It 
s 
not

u 
consider 
how 
vulnerable 
that 
Arsenal 
is 
Unbeaten 
in 
league 
games 
yet 
only 
ahead 
of 
a 
team 
who 
can 
t 
possibly 
play 
worse 
Think 
before 
u 
tweet 
pal 
Yeah 
I 
was 
gonna 
say 
that 
but 
it 
t 
get 
them 
extra 
money 
as 
live 
cards 
are 
out 
of 
packs 
It 
s 
an 
illogical 
move 
from 
EA 
Who 
s 
surprised 
at 
this 
point 
sterling 
Yeah 
I 
get 
that 
but 
finishing 
stat 
should 
be 
based 
on 
how 
good 
of 
a 
finisher 
u 
are 
not 
how 
many 
goals 
u 
score 
We 
can 
all 
clearly 
see 
that 
he 
s 
not 
a 
natural 
finisher 
and 
scores 
a 
lot 
as 
he 
gets 
a 
lot 
of 
chances 
But 
credit 
to 
him 
for 
still 
scoring 
sterling 
I 
guess 
u 
haven 
t 
seen 
some 
of 
his 
finishing 
I 
rate 
him 
as 
a 
class 
player 
but 
in 
team 
he 
d 
struggle 
to 
get 
goals 
a 
season 
I 
think 
that 
was 
his 
point

How 
sad 
does 
life 
have 
to 
be 
to 
think 
it 
s 
normal 
to 
do 
that 
Who 
actually 
cares 
about 
if 
he 
took 
the 
shot 
If 
u 
had 
a 
chance 
to 
go 
for 
would 
u 
not 
take 
it 
He 
might 
never 
get 
again 
Have 
u 
seen 
this 
team 
without 
He 
is 
the 
glue 
of 
the 
team 
Anyone 
that 
wants 
him 
traded 
is 
straight 
up 
deluded 
Boards 
his 
strong 
point 
but 
he 
offers 
so 
much 
That 
s 
why 
AD 
would 
be 
perfect 
at 
the 
with 
him 
but 
that 
d 
probably 
mean 
giving 
up 
picks 
and 
or 
But 
when 
he 
was 
making 
them 
at 
a 
high 
rate 
I 
doubt 
you 
were 
complaining 
then 
So 
suddenly 
when 
he 
s 
not 
making 
them 
he 
t 
take 
any 
It 
s 
games 
in 
Why 
are 
people

Can

imagine 
the

So 
much 
respect 
What 
a 
moment 
Hope 
he 
can 
get 
his 
explosiveness 
back 
to 
and 
then 
see 
him 
be 
even 
better 
He 
looks 
really 
good 
Explosive 
but 
Not 
as 
explosive 
as 
in 
Chicago

hopefully 
that 
ll 
come

over

What 
a

So 
good

Why

what

Yeah

if

they

U 
blatantly 
t 
watch

First

shots 
He

well

created 
open 
shots 
for 
others 
by

This

Beautiful

can

so 
that 
s 
a 
sign 
for 
me 
to 
leave 
this 
conversation 
Bye 
bye 
U 
clearly 
t 
read 
my 
tweet 
properly 
or 
just 
plain 
stupid 
do 
they 
expect 
us 
to 
get 
over 
k 
in 
the 
space 
of 
days 
Defensively 
not 
a 
chance 
The 
only 
real 
problem 
with 
smalling 
is 
his 
technical 
ability 
and 
his 
discipline 
in 
terms 
of 
staying 
in 
position 
He 
can 
t 
deal 
with 
bouncing 
crosses 
but 
is 
over 
aggressive 
and 
just 
lumps 
it 
instead 
of 
looking 
for 
a 
pass 
Not 
sure 
how 
u 
get 
taught 
in 
wales 
but 
u 
both 
can 
t 
seem 
to 
spell 
clown 
properly 
not 
gonna 
bother 
explaining 
why 
Alexis 
is 
struggling 
cos 
a 
Cardiff 
fan 
most 
likely 
won 
t 
understand 
because 
they 
never 
been 
near 
a 
player 
of 
Alexis

done

proud 
Na 
I 
m 
an 
Ur 
and 
u 
use 
a

filter 
so 
I 
think 
we 
know 
who 
the 
real 
is 
s 
and 
under 
t 
allowed 
to 
argue 
I 
m 
afraid 
Super 
Goals 
conceded 
don 
t 
show 
if 
a 
has 
been 
good 
If 
u 
actually 
watch 
them 
they 
are 
still 
a 
shambles 
at 
the 
back 
with 
only 
a 
slight 
improvement 
They 
rode 
their 
luck 
defensively 
in 
a 
lot 
of 
the 
wins 
I 
actually 
agree 
with 
I 
don 
t 
mean 
they 
rank 
low 
in 
rebounding 
but 
the 
only 
one 
close 
to 
being 
considered 
a 
rebounder 
is 
and 
AL 
is 
decent 
with 
rim 
protection 
but 
there 
s 
no 
specialists 
at 
either 
Maybe 
u 
haven 
t 
watched 
the 
last 
few 
seasons 
That 
s 
the 
definition 
of 
Tasha 
U 
are 
very 
disrespectful

about

Why

then 
That 
was 
me 
saying 
on

fella 
The 
only 
weakness 
was 
the 
rebounding 
Unfortunately 
it 
s 
still 
there 
a 
bit 
but 
hopefully 
will 
help 
that 
when 
he 
s 
back 
Never

Can

If 
that 
s 
how 
gonna 
compare 
them 
then 
that 
s 
fair 
but 
for 
me 
the 
better 
player 
is 
the 
one 
who 
comes 
up 
big 
in 
when 
it 
matters 
most 
and 
has 
proven 
it 
in 
in 
the 
finals 
which 
has 
never 
been 
to 
despite 
being 
years 
older 
He 
has 
more 
to 
his 
game 
yeah 
but 
no 
F 
appearance 
So 
u 
just 
gonna 
forget 
about 
the 
history 
of 
injuries 
with 
but 
say 
he 
s 
better 
than 
But 
cos 
he 
t 
play 
for 
rockets 
the 
injuries 
make 
less 
valuable 
than 
who 
s 
had 
countless 
injuries 
Also 
don

players

What 
did 
those 
triple 
doubles 
get 
his 
team 
was 
suffering 
from 
numerous 
injuries 
throughout 
most 
the 
season 
so 
u 
can 
t 
compare 
their 
seasons

who

Man

is 
better 
than 
one 
of 
the 
most

PG 
s 
in

who 
s

Out 
of 
all 
those 
PG 
s 
mentioned 
tell 
me 
who 
delivers 
when 
it 
matters 
most 
more 
than

drew 
Na 
but 
used 
to 
be 
elite 
He 
s 
so 
obviously 
t 
be 
in 
the 
conversation 
The 
thing 
for 
me 
that 
separates 
is 
that 
he 
can 
literally 
get 
any 
shot 
at 
any 
time 
in 
the 
game 
Also 
an 
underrated 
passer 
Ur 
jokes

Who 
has 
a 
ring 
is 
still 
really 
good 
but 
is 
in 
his 
prime 
and 
t 
as 
good 
as 
he 
once 
was 
Westbrook 
is 
nothing 
on 
as 
he 
takes 
awful 
shots 
And 
t 
clutch 
There 
s 
an 
argument 
to 
say 
that 
none 
of 
them 
are 
better 
but 
it 
s 
an 
opinion

There

no

anyone 
is 
better 
It 
s 
not 
even 
close 
Which 
are 
better 
then 
Yeah 
but 
those 
injuries 
don 
t 
make 
him 
tell 
his 
team 
to 
just 
attack 
and 
play 
a 
high 
line 
against 
an 
attacking 
force 
like 
Arsenal 
He 
does 
himself 
no

u 
been 
on 
that 
good 
shit 
EB 
What 
s 
that 
No 
need 
to 
continue 
this 
discussion 
Then 
proceeds 
to 
carry 
on 
U 
is 
very 
stupid 
pal 
Alan 
Jones 
Yeah 
I 
understand 
it 
s 
not 
his 
style 
but 
wolves 
have 
changed 
to 
a 
more 
defensive 
style 
and 
they 
look 
like 
a 
top 
side 
ketone 
Na 
that 
s 
reasonable 
Arsenal 
are 
still 
shit 
at 
the 
back 
Thanks 
for 
clarifying 
it 
as 
a 
draw 
I 
thought 
u 
meant 
a 
win 
for 
city 
Liverpool 
And 
and 
ahead 
of 
C 
and 
Fair 
play 
for 
not 
dropping

I 
m 
no 
fan 
and 
u 
lot 
probably 
know 
more 
but 
I 
think 
this 
is 
on 
the 
manager 
He 
s 
constantly 
changing 
the 
and 
sets 
out 
to 
concede 
He 
needs 
to 
u 
don 
t 
have 
players 
like 
city 
and 
Liverpool 
so 
can 
t 
just 
go 
all 
out 
especially 
against 
Arsenal

I

they 
saw

just 
to

on 
it

it 
was 
clear 
to

Have 
u 
really 
just 
seen

blatant

on

only 
focused 
on 
the

I 
actually 
love 
Alexis 
Can

even 
explain 
how 
buzzing 
I 
am 
for

Alexis 
is 
the 
best

U 
need 
to 
have 
someone 
as 
good 
as 
him 
on 
There 
s 
risking 
it 
and 
there 
s 
that 
I 
just 
don 
t 
get 
how 
u 
can 
t 
play 
for 
the 
gaffer 
They 
are 
trying 
a 
bit 
but 
they 
could 
put 
so 
much 
more 
effort 
in 
It 
s 
embarrassing 
Fucked 
up

Watched 
it

it

perfectly 
timed 
Think

Don

even 
saying 
Subtitles 
please 
U 
just 
contradicted 
mate 
But 
the 
players 
are 
the 
one 
that 
played 
Look 
I 
know 
there 
are 
and 
have 
been 
some 
genius 
managers 
like 
pep 
and 
but 
all 
I 
m 
saying 
is 
that 
I 
think 
they 
get 
too 
much 
credit 
or 
stick 
when 
u 
consider 
that 
games 
are 
separated 
by 
fine 
margins 
which 
is 
all 
down 
to 
the 
players 
That 
was 
in 
a 
competition 
that 
all 
teams 
are 
in

N 
Na 
I 
m 
pretty 
sure 
they 
both 
know 
he 
s 
the 
best 
player 
pal 
But 
there 
s 
so 
many 
good 
passers 
and 
he 
t 
get 
as 
much 
credit 
as 
others 
probably 
cos 
the 
dribbling 
goals 
and 
assists 
overshadow 
his 
passing 
Just 
cos 
his 
team 
might 
not 
have 
won 
finals 
how 
does 
that 
instantly 
mean 
it 
makes 
him 
the 
bottler 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
day 
the 
players 
are 
the 
ones 
out 
there 
so 
his 
team 
have 
been 
bottlers 
if 
anything 
I 
don 
t 
get 
how 
people 
like 
it 
They 
must 
have 
different

With 
loads

cards 
quite 
expensive

there

No

No

it 
was 
a 
disastrous 
tweet 
He 
t 
give 
a 
fuck 
cos 
he 
t 
got 
the 
passion 
and 
only 
seems 
to 
care 
when 
playing 
with 
France 
Probably 
only 
cos 
they 
won

No 
easy 
games

big 
time

When 
will 
people 
learn 
No 
people 
like 
u 
are 
deluded 
U 
can 
see 
he 
s 
not 
fully 
committed 
After 
the 
final 
whistle 
is 
on 
the 
floor 
pissed 
off 
after 
giving 
everything 
and 
then 
there 
s 
having 
a 
joke 
with 
If 
he 
really 
cared 
he 
d 
show 
it 
by 
either 
trying 
or 
looking 
disappointed 
What 
a 
disastrous 
tweet 
I 
agree 
Thankfully 
he 
s 
not 
gonna 
be 
part 
of 
the 
bench 
rotation 
but 
yeah 
I 
don 
t 
think 
he 
offers 
that 
much 
as 
of 
now 
Herrera 
is 
fucking 
shit 
and 
inconsistent 
and 
offers 
no 
protection 
is 
understandable 
but 
should 
always 
start 
unless 
he

s 
just 
been

Douglas 
No 
this

system 
and 
average 
inconsistent

a 
huge 
part

why 
he

struggling 
Who 
can

link 
up 
with 
in

s

U 
don 
t 
just 
lose 
talent

people 
don

Don 
t 
get 
me 
wrong 
he 
has 
been 
poor 
with 
giving 
the 
ball 
away 
etc 
but 
what 
can 
he 
do 
when 
he 
s 
in 
a

system 
with 
players 
that 
can 
t 
do

up

U 
can 
see 
he 
s 
lacking 
any 
confidence 
Rom

Embarrassing 
The 
fans 
don 
t 
fucking 
help 
cheering 
when 
Alexis 
comes 
off 
He 
s 
actually 
been 
one 
of 
the 
best 
recently 
so 
not 
a 
great 
example 
mate 
Not 
much 
Quite 
easy 
there 
s 
people 
transferring 
in 
players 
like 
who 
are 
on 
loan 
so 
that 
s 
nothing 
on 
that 
s 
too 
generous 
They 
dropped 
points 
in 
out 
of 
games 
If 
u 
think 
that 
sort 
of 
return 
will 
get 
th 
or 
th 
then 
mad 
son 
If 
anything 
the 
points 
return 
is 
better 
than 
the 
performances 
that 
s 
how 
bad 
they 
been

Look 
so

So 
many 
things

I

not 
gonna 
name 
half 
of

Driven 
shots 
Passing 
and 
build 
up

impossible 
when 
it 
s 
so 
slow 
paced 
so 
the 
AI 
just 
intercept 
and 
tackle 
so 
easily 
alp 
I 
guess 
u 
have 
completely 
different 
to 
me 
cos 
if 
u 
had 
my

said

was 
good 
then 
I 
d 
send 
for 
some 
serious 
help 
for 
u 
Don 
t 
u 
feel 
the 
is 
slow 
and 
clunky 
It 
s 
impossible 
to 
create 
chances

time 
you 
made 
a

read 
it

s 
done

an 
embarrassing 
tweet 
So 
much 
wrong 
with 
it 
that 
I 
m 
not 
even 
gonna 
explain 
On

fish 
More 
like

I 
m 
right 
so

bring 
my 
into

both

do

but 
I 
m 
no 
mind 
reader 
pal 
I 
m 
sure 
half 
the 
people 
that 
liked 
it 
think 
being 
serious 
Why 
do 
u 
have 
to 
let 
go 
of 
Did 
look 
like 
a 
travel 
to 
be 
fair 
But 
cos 
it 
s 
they 
probably 
think 
he 
s 
so 
good 
that 
he 
t 
travel 
Shit 
yeah 
that 
s 
so 
obvious 
and 
I 
t 
even 
think 
of 
that 
cheers 
mate 
The 
is 
still 
slow 
and 
clunky 
I 
m 
guessing 
Matt 
and 
others 
who 
like 
it 
have 
different 
to 
me 
cos 
mine 
is 
horrible 
It 
t 
ruin 
at 
all 
It 
just 
meant 
there 
was 
more 
emphasis 
placed 
on 
how 
good 
u 
r 
defensively 
I 
suppose 
that 
s 
easy 
to 
say 
when 
I 
got 
I 
seen 
many 
people 
complain 
about 
driven 
shots 
Ur 
telling 
me 
u 
don 
t 
accidentally 
chip 
it 
instead 
of 
it 
doing 
a 
driven 
shot 
Yeah 
it 
s 
so 
slow 
for 
me 
So 
hard 
to 
split 
a 
open 
when 
they 
re 
passing 
at 
mph 
They 
ruined 
driven 
shots 
Why 
do 
u 
have 
to 
press 
lb 
and 
b 
for 
it 
In 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
moment 
it 
s 
impossible 
to 
do 
a 
driven 
shot 
cos 
it 
just 
fucks 
up 
by 
chipping 
it 
The 
fact 
that 
he 
s 
robbed 
someone 
before 
makes 
him 
a 
tosser 
that 
deserves 
no 
respect 
Fuck 
the 
respect 
bro

Terry 
But 
it 
t 
I 
reckon 
the

comeback

s

Benching

is 
more 
understandable 
but 
I 
was 
saying 
to 
the 
other 
lad 
that 
u 
never 
bench

u 
sad

take

when 
called 
Yeah 
it 
s 
all 
well 
and 
good 
saying 
it 
when 
they 
get 
points 
benching 
a 
premium 
defender 
is 
a 
no

pal 
Imagine

NBA 
Man 
I 
can 
t 
explain 
how 
much 
I 
wanna 
see 
him 
back 
at 
his 
best 
Totally 
agree 
I 
went 
on 
kick 
off 
to 
practice 
and 
half 
of 
the 
great 
timing 
shots 
went 
over 
So 
I 
just 
turned 
it 
off 
Looks 
like 
he 
wants 
to 
end 
someone 
but 
top 
class 
Yes 
trips 
Ur 
lucky 
at 
work 
instead 
of 
watching 
that 
shit 
show 
of 
a 
half 
No 
we 
don 
t 
play 
to 
his 
strengths 
Go 
and 
take 
a 
look 
back 
on 
his 
goals 
and 
then 
tell 
me 
we 
play 
to 
his 
strengths 
It 
also 
t 
help 
when 
quite 
a 
few 
teams 
park 
the 
bus 
so 
he 
has 
barely 
any 
space 
I 
agree 
with 
all 
of 
that 
but 
he 
d 
give 
much 
more 
if 
we 
actually 
knew 
what 
a 
cross 
was 
t 
often 
get 
into 
good 
positions 
so 
u 
can 
t 
judge 
his 
finishing 
really 
But 
Rom 
offers 
so 
much 
more 
especially 
when 
u 
play 
to 
his 
strengths 
which

Ah 
so 
if 
I

there 
t 
an

there

words

Let 
s 
be 
honest 
every 
player 
has 
a 
mistake 
waiting 
to 
happen 
The 
main 
issue 
with 
smalling 
is 
he 
tends 
to 
run 
out 
of 
position 
a 
lot 
and 
he 
struggles 
with 
a 
lot 
of 
bouncing 
balls 
and 
awkward 
crosses 
cos 
of 
his 
shot 
technique 
albeit 
a 
beauty 
of 
a 
goal 
If

on

what 
I 
don 
t 
only 
do 
I 
watch 
arsenal 
almost 
just 
as 
much 
and 
is 
a 
joke 
of 
a 
player 
Why 
do 
u 
think 
even 
most 
Arsenal 
fans 
with 
a 
brain 
which 
u 
don 
t 
think 
he 
s 
shit 
Appalling 
of 
a 
response 
that 
guessing 
that 
I 
don 
t

team 
He 
d 
be 
a 
shit 
winger 
can 
t 
dribble 
weak 
and 
scared 
of 
going

No 
shooting 
or

Joke 
of 
a 
rep 
When 
will 
fools 
like 
u 
learn 
don 
t 
believe 
everything 
u 
read 
U 
t 
know 
him 
personally 
and 
t 
around 
him 
when 
this 
supposedly 
happened 
In 
years 
of 
football 
That 
t 
make 
him 
better 
CR 
got 
in 
ahead 
of 
Think 
we 
know 
who 
s 
better 
Also 
that 
was 
s 
first 
world 
class 
season 
about 
years 
of 
football 
Come 
back 
when 
he 
s 
been 
as 
consistent 
as 
and 
How 
stupid 
do 
u 
have 
to 
be 
to 
think 
t 
the 
better 
player 
is 
the 
better 
goal 
scorer 
Apart 
from 
that 
is 
better 
in 
every 
department 
If 
u 
think 
otherwise 
then 
u 
have 
been 
diagnosed 
with 
delusion 
son 
If 
u 
were 
a 
RM 
fan 
telling 
me 
u 
would 
say 
Mo 
is 
better 
is 
a 
class 
above 
It 
s 
not 
all 
about 
goals 
Stop 
with 
the 
bias 
and 
delusion 
pal 
Top 
role 
model 
and 
absolute 
class 
person 
and 
player 
He 
will 
win 
at 
least 
more 
slam 
I 
m 
sure 
No 
matter 
how 
many 
more 
goals 
gets 
than 
he 
should 
never 
be 
classed 
as 
better 
For 
to 
put 
up 
the 
numbers 
that 
he 
does 
as 
not 
even 
a 
striker 
is 
out 
of 
this 
world 
And 
for 
how 
special 
he 
is 
at 
what 
he 
does 
no 
one 
will 
ever 
surpass 
him 
There 
s 
no 
comparison 
U 
rep 
one 
of 
the 
worst 
and 
most 
inept 
full 
backs 
we 
might 
ever 
see 
can 
t 
believe 
people 
even 
rated 
him 
in 
the 
first 
place 
He 
literally 
offers 
nothing 
more 
often 
than 
not 
Could 
see 
from 
ages 
back 
that 
he 
s 
all 
hype 
No 
defensive 
brain 
can 
t 
cross 
in 
the 
air 
accurately 
Respect 
to

class

Maybe 
I 
have 
but 
I 
m 
pretty 
sure 
it 
t 
for 
long 
and 
it 
was 
Plus 
it 
s 
just 
an 
opinion 
so 
there 
s 
no 
right 
answer

Bailly 
needs 
a 
different 
CB 
next 
to 
him 
Not 
any 
of 
these 
ones 
including 
smalling

we

First 
off 
look

And 
if 
u 
think 
aggressive 
like 
bailly 
and 
is 
the 
best 
combination 
then 
it 
looks 
like 
on 
some 
shit 
Smalling 
does 
go 
out 
of 
position 
sometimes 
but 
at 
least 
he 
can 
do 
a

more

are 
u 
pal 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
day 
u 
should 
be 
blaming 
Serena 
s 
coach 
as 
if 
he 
knew 
the 
rules 
none 
of 
this 
shit 
happened 
Also 
all 
Serena 
had 
to 
do 
was 
accept 
the 
CV 
and 
carry 
on 
The 
combination 
of 
the 
umpire 
Serena 
and 
her 
coach 
ruined

bailly

As 
much 
stick 
as

gets 
he

Not

I

defending

most

I 
suppose 
he

I

at

I

to

And 
second 
off 
he 
s 
got 
everything 
to 
be 
a 
top 
midfielder

needs 
the 
right 
partnership 
Stick 
to 
cricket

Super 
He 
t 
bought 
to 
do 
the 
dirty 
work 
which 
is 
why 
we 
signed 
He 
can 
t 
play 
in 
a 
cos 
he 
has 
no 
defensive 
discipline 
which 
leaves 
exposed 
mainly 
in

games 
So 
him 
and 
need 
a
