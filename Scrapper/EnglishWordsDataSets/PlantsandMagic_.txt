Ellie 
sighed 
and 
shook 
her 
head 
I 
m 
here 
to 
help 
you 
carry 
your 
burdens 
I 
want 
to 
help

Okay 
She 
rubbed 
the 
back 
of 
his 
hand 
with 
her 
thumb 
I 
do 
She 
went 
over 
and 
started 
to 
go 
them 
so 
she 
could 
save 
but 
most 
of 
them 
were 
dead 
She 
could 
replant 
and 
start 
again 
Yeah 
of 
course 
I 
m 
not 
but 
I 
know 
enough 
Or 
you 
could 
write 
it 
down 
Oh

god 
sign 
to 
me 
then 
ass 
She 
is 
Emily 
s 
arm 
Hey

worth 
it

to

might 
be 
able 
to 
I 
have 
to 
be 
sure 
they 
re 
not 
help 
She 
held 
his 
hand 
and 
it 
Thank 
you 
After 
a 
while 
Ellie 
turned 
up 
her 
hair 
up 
in 
a 
ponytail 
She 
waved 
at 
and 
came 
over 
It 
looks 
better 
already 
Thank 
you 
She 
moved 
to 
her 
bathroom 
undressing 
and 
taking 
a 
long 
shower 
Once 
done 
she 
dried 
and 
headed 
to 
find 
Are 
you 
sure 
she 
asked 
tucking 
hair 
behind 
her 
ear 
Thank 
you 
I

t 
be 
long 
Ellie 
sighed 
and 
shook 
her 
head 
Alex 
stop 
it 
Please 
Yeah 
I 
got 
mad 
at 
you 
but 
I 
don 
t 
hate 
you 
okay 
WE 
both 
have 
our 
own 
issues 
and 
we 
kinda 
clash 
I 
m 
going 
to 
shower 
and 
change 
do 
you 
want 
to 
meet 
me 
at 
my 
garden 
in 
a 
few 
Wow 
Ellie 
frowned 
You 
don 
t 
pick 
and 
choose 
who 
you 
fall 
in 
love 
with 
Alex 
Trust 
me 
I 
know 
And 
leaving 
you 
would 
be 
the 
worst 
idea 
right 
now 
It 
s 
Panic 
At 
the 
disco 
It 
s 
from 
a 
song 
Well 
I 
know 
it 
just 
t 
feel 
like 
a 
night 
out 
with 
no 
one 
sizing 
you 
up 
Are 
you 
not 
a 
couple 
she 
asked 
looking 
over 
at 
him 
sighed 
and 
nuzzled 
into 
him 
She 
sat 
down 
and 
sighed 
Alex 
she 
rubbed 
her 
face 
I 
was 
furious 
at 
you 
I 
wanted 
you 
to 
suffer 
but 
not 
like 
this 
If 
I 
can 
help 
in 
anyway 
i 
m 
here 
Well 
either 
for 
Valentines 
because 
You 
know 
You 
and 
her 
Thank 
you 
She 
hugged 
him 
back 
tightly 
She 
sighed 
I 
will 
thank 
you 
What 
it 
s 
a 
bad 
time 
They 
are 
all 
arguing 
you 
should 
go 
somewhere 
you 
can 
be 
relaxed 
I 
ll 
take 
that 
as 
a 
no 
Has 
anyone 
seen 
Ash 
Oh 
you 
will 
She 
shifted 
slightly 
So 
I 
can 
make 
you 
up 
a 
bouquet 
fro 
Amy 
if 
you 
wanted 
She 
nodded 
Please 
I 
do 
I 
love 
it 
here 
You 
should 
be 
here 
when 
it 
s 
spring 
the 
myriad 
of 
are 
amazing 
I 
I 
know 
I 
ll 
fix 
it 
I 
ll 
fix 
all 
of 
it 
I 
was 
he 
sighed 
It 
s 
a 
long 
story 
O 
okay 
okay 
She 
was 
finding 
it 
hard 
to 
be 
mad 
at 
him 
Alex 
I 
can 
tell 
her 
but 
that 
is 
all 
I 
can 
do 
If 
I 
can 
t 
help 
you 
i 
m 
at 
a 
loss 
I 
can 
be 
by 
side 
What 
did 
you 
want 
to 
see 
here 
It 
s 
just 
plants 
it 
s 
not 
that 
exciting 
I 
I 
think 
I 
did 
it 
myself 
I 
being 
really 
angry 
and 
i 
was 
crying 
thing 
I 
know 
I 
m 
here 
Well 
maybe 
I 
can 
use 
my 
powers 
to 
heal 
you 
Make 
you 
better 
I 
seen 
and 
do 
it 
it 
can 
t 
be 
that 
hard 
I 
guess 
she 
knelt 
by 
a 
row 
of 
plants 
and 
stroked 
one 
They 
are 
just 
like 
us 
you 
now 
alive 
Connected 
to 
the 
universe 
It 
was 
a 
few 
hours 
before 
she 
woke 
her 
head 
hurt 
and 
her 
body 
ached 
Looking 
around 
she 
saw 
Where 
what 
happened 
down 
on 
her 
knees 
him 
she 
a 
hand 
on 
his 
shoulder 
and 
it 
glows 
blue 
Ellie 
is 
to 
calm 
him 
trying 
to 
make 
him 
feel 
better 
has 
me 
things 
that 
can 
help 
you 
She 
let 
out 
a 
sigh 
shaking 
her 
head 
And 
what 
did 
you 
do 
You 
hid 
and 
you 
ran 
She 
took 
deep 
breaths 
so 
angry 
right 
now 
At 
him 
At 
others 
I 
could 
have 
helped 
you 
and 
I 
feel 
like 
I 
was 
treated 
as 
second 
best 
Tears 
collected 
in 
her 
eyes 
and 
she 
walked 
over 
to 
him 
She 
sighed 
a 
frown 
on 
her 
face 
I 
m 
sorry 
it 
s 
not 
the 
best 
subject 
it 
all 
and 
yet 
you 
do 
drugs 
and 
get 
drunk 
and 
act 
like 
a 
total 
dick 
I 
fucking 
hate 
that 
I 
love 
you 
but 
you 
can 
t 
handle 
how 
you 
are 
Taking 
a 
deep 
breath 
she 
sighed 
You 
want 
to 
know 
what 
issue 
I 
have 
with 
you 
She 
turned 
on 
her 
heel 
to 
face 
him 
You 
go 
on 
and 
on 
about 
how 
shit 
your 
life 
is 
but 
you 
have 
two 
parents 
who 
love 
each 
other 
People 
like 
you 
your 
mother 
is 
involved 
in 
your 
life 
You 
have 
Not 
really 
She 
sighed 
I 
m 
was 
like 
Scarlet 
witch 
before 
she 
exploded 
I 
could 
have 
hurt 
everyone 
I 
loved 
Sobbing 
hard 
she 
dropped 
to 
her 
knees 
and 
wave 
of 
blue 
left 
her 
body 
washing 
over 
the 
whole 
room 
before 
she 
passed 
out 
Guess 
who 
is 
trashing 
her 
garden 
And 
that 
is 
all 
your 
fault 
I 
have 
tried 
so 
so 
hard 
But 
you 
just 
don 
t 
bother 
You 
never 
bother 
I 
m 
done 
Alex 
I 
m 
not 
getting 
hurt 
by 
you 
anymore 
Ellie 
turned 
to 
leave 
Well 
kinda 
She 
used 
on 
dad 
and 
What 
ever 
was 
in 
him 
must 
have 
stored 
up 
in 
me 
I 
guess 
She 
took 
a 
few 
steps 
back 
the 
glow 
fading 
and 
she 
hugged 
herself 
That 
s 
fresh 
coming 
from 
you 
but 
what 
ever 
right 
You 
can 
do 
what 
you 
want 
The 
quintessence 
helps 
her 
hand 
glows 
blue 
Being 
connected 
to 
the 
life 
force 
kind 
of 
helps 
Bob 
does 
not 
smell 
of 
roses 
He 
smells 
of 
lavenders 
Yeah

exploring 
the 
affects 
of 
quintessence 
on 
Mrs 
Holt 
s 
gardening 
program 
I 
do 
it 
here 
so 
i 
m 
not 
under 
her 
feet 
I 
I 
guess 
I 
read 
a 
lot 
of 
things 
and 
they 
just 
stick 
in 
my 
head 
She 
shrugged 
and 
led 
him 
into 
the 
room 
More 
of 
the 
flowers 
and 
plants 
were 
blooming 
White 
rose 
Different 
rose 
mean 
different 
things 
For 
example 
A 
means 
purity 
and 
innocence 
A 
Red 
rose 
is 
love 
lavender 
roses 
are 
love 
at 
first 
sight 
A 
deep 
crimson 
blood 
red 
rose 
means 
mourning 
She 
nodded 
and 
headed 
out 
the 
door 
I 
brush 
my 
teeth 
perfectly 
thank 
you 
Ash 
We

about

She 
and 
looked 
away 
hands 
balled 
into 
fists 
I 
am 
well 
aware 
of 
what 
I 
said 
Alex 
I 
m 
trying 
to 
say 
sorry 
she 
nodded 
not 
sure 
if 
she 
was 
ready 
to 
learn 
the 
answer 
I 
was 
gone 
for 
longer 
but 
yeah 
it 
s 
hard 
Well

She 
and 
frowned 
My 
dad

See

sighed 
I

but 
it 
was 
hard 
I 
t 
want

No

thumb 
She 
saved 
me 
and

evil 
for 
her 
I

something 
then 
Firstly 
I 
want 
to 
say 
sorry 
A 
lot 
on 
and 
I 
t 
in 
my 
right 
mind 
Still 
that 
is 
no 
real 
excuse 
for 
being 
so 
rude 
She 
mustered 
all 
her 
courage 
and 
walked 
over 
to 
Alex 
C 
Can

Want

squeaked 
trying 
to 
wriggle 
out 
of 
s 
grip 
I 
don 
t

being 
She 
grunted 
as 
she 
hit 
the 
wall 
and 
blinked 
what 
neither 
of 
them 
knew 
was 
s 
plan 
was 
to 
bring 
Ellie 
up 
as 
her 
own 
but 
Lance 
had 
put 
a 
stop 
to

Still

Ellie 
had 
been 
with 
long 
enough 
for 
her 
to 
make 
the 
slip 
up 
But 
she 
was 
there 
for 
me 
I 
I 
remember 
Ellie 
walked 
with 
him 
not 
sure 
what 
else 
to 
say 
Well 
she 
taught 
me 
how 
to 
control 
my 
powers 
She 
made 
sure 
I 
wont 
hurt 
any 
of 
you 
by 
accident 
She

line 
for 
the 
kitchen 
Oh

A

Bag

Thumbs

a 
bag 
darting

bathroom

She 
got 
to 
her 
feet 
and 
ran 
to 
the 
bathroom

Curls

She

focusing 
on

Grabs 
her 
head 
and 
closes 
her 
eyes 
tightly

She 
nodded 
and 
took 
his 
hand 
Come 
on 
No 
one 
else 
would 
help 
and 
I 
was 
scared 
I 
took 
the 
help 
I 
could 
get 
Tell 
mom 
when 
Lance

idea 
Shall

I 
t 
have 
a 
choice 
I 
want 
too 
but 
she 
did 
help 
me 
She 
rested 
a 
hand 
on 
his 
forehead 
and 
her 
hand 
lit 
up 
a 
soft 
blue 
You 
don 
t 
seem 
off 
to 
me 
but 
what

I 
know 
Hugging

she 
sighed 
Who

Right 
Right 
My 
mom

She 
into 
his 
touch 
and 
closed 
her 
eyes 
feeling 
comfort 
She 
looked 
at 
him 
confused 
M 
my 
mom 
I 
I 
don 
t 
looking 
at 
the 
floor 
she 
shook 
her 
head 
M

She

head 
W

Lance 
Or

hugged 
herself 
Do 
you 
think 
she 
has 
She 
was 
so 
protective 
of 
me 
Touching 
my 
cheeks 
playing 
with 
my 
hair 
Do 
you 
think 
she 
planned 
on 
raising 
me 
as 
her 
own 
I 
know 
they 
all 
got 
worried 
because 
baby 
me 
but 
they 
seem 
to 
have 
all 
calmed 
down 
now 
Something

would 
never 
hurt 
me 
N 
No

really 
bad 
headaches 
forgetting 
things 
and 
new 
memories

popping 
up 
Like 
my 
whole 
past 
is 
being 
re 
written 
She 
nodded 
and 
looked 
away 
Were 
you 
sent 
to 
talk 
to 
me 
Because 
I 
was 
rude 
to 
everyone 
She 
sat 
up 
and 
got 
to 
her 
feet 
backing 
up 
S 
I 
I 
I 
would 
never 
hurt 
anyone 
you 
know 
that 
right 
Drains 
the 
from 
a 
flower 
and 
then 
revives 
said 
flower 
again 
Life

so 
fragile 
She 
is 
in 
the 
garden 
just 
crying 
She

Alex

No

Em

my 
dad 
the 
plant 
started 
to 
get 
better 
and 
she 
smiled 
her 
hands

looked 
better 
There

Just

every

Hugging 
him 
tightly 
she 
relaxed 
finally 
feeling 
home 
you 
don 
t 
have 
a 
dumb 
face 
I 
kinda 
like 
your 
face 
she 
hummed 
What 
did 
I 
miss 
Who 
lived 
who 
loved 
and 
who 
died 
To 
warn 
you 
She 
stepped 
into 
the 
garden 
and 
ran 
over 
to 
a 
plant 
that 
it 
was 
sick 
She 
knelt 
down 
her 
hands 
on 
the 
plant 
and 
her 
hands 
and 
eyes 
started 
to 
glow 
Guess 
who 
wishes 
she 
had 
never 
come 
back 
This 
is 
gonna 
be 
Ellie 
Rolls 
eyes 
I 
m 
gonna 
find 
my 
guitar 
and 
start 
my 
new 
career 
I

talking 
but 
you

ignoring 
me 
too 
my 
ass 
I 
AM 
LITERALLY 
HERE 
ALEX 
Where 
is 
my 
guitar 
My 
first 
hit 
in 
my 
Country 
singer 
career 
is 
a 
cover 
of 
Danger 
zone 
I 
m 
gonna 
become 
a 
country 
singer 
and 
sing 
about 
being 
at 
a 
bar 
and 
the 
man 
who 
got 
away 
No 
People 
can 
get 
scared 
about 
stuff 
like 
this 
I 
just 
t 
want 
you 
scared 
I 
t 
want 
you 
freaking 
out 
when 
my 
hands 
do 
this 
They 
started 
to 
glow 
light 
blue 
her 
eyes 
glowing 
as 
well 
So 
A 
little 
back 
story 
before 
you 
garden 
I 
had 
to 
get 
help 
from 
the 
evil 
witch 
lady 
our 
parents 
were 
fighting 
So 
I 
can 
kinda 
do 
alchemy 
like 
Aunt 
She 
nodded 
and 
offered 
her 
hand 
Come 
with 
me 
she 
started 
to 
walk 
towards 
the 
Garden 
She 
shuffled 
a 
little 
closer 
You 
wanna 
go 
do 
something 
Her 
eyes 
widen 
and 
she 
blushed 
O 
oh 
Well 
it 
s 
working 
Ar 
sure 
It 
s 
not 
fair 
if 
you 
re 
getting 
me 
stuff 
and 
i 
m 
not 
In 
the 
flesh 
She 
stepped 
in 
and 
waved 
I 
wanted 
to 
see 
you 
since 
I 
came 
back 
a 
while 
ago 
I 
missed 
your 
dumb 
face 
She 
teased 
She 
chuckled 
softly 
That 
is 
so 
cute 
of 
you 
Thank 
you 
What 
about 
you 
What 
gift 
can 
i 
get 
you 
Y

t 
have 
to 
remember 
U 
unless 
you 
of 
course 
d 
I 
m 
always 
in 
the 
Garden 
Oh 
yeah 
well 
roses 
and 
The 
pretty 
pink 
ones 
and 
Blood 
red 
and 
purple 
Roses 
She 
nodded 
Glad 
to 
hear 
that 
Another 
groan 
and 
then 
Ellie 
was 
passing 
out 
Rubs 
her 
eyes 
Headache 
Winces 
Is 
that 
wrong 
In 
my 
universe 
your 
dad 
is 
with 
my 
mom 
so 
technically 
I 
both 
my 
dad 
s 
Not 
your 
fault 
Dad 
loves 
me 
no 
matter 
what 
so 
it 
t 
matter 
what 
goes 
on 
with 
mom 
Oh 
Elisa 
She 
sighed 
and 
the 
blue 
in 
her 
eyes 
faded 
I 
ll 
let 
it 
go 
this 
time 
WHY 
are 
you 
EATING 
THE 
FLOWERS 
WHY 
ARE 
YOU 
EATING 
THE 
FLOWERS 
Her 
eyes 
glow 
blue 
she 
sighed 
My 
mom 
and 
dad 
had 
a 
one 
night 
stand 
and 
my 
mom 
t 
even 
tell 
dad 
about 
me 
until 
I 
was 
about 
years 
old 
It 
bloomed 
pretty 
fast 
and 
was 
a 
soft 
chuckle 
from 
behind 
him 
Ellie 
had 
been 
waiting 
fro 
him 
to 
so 
she 
could 
see 
him 
Well 
she 
sighed 
Like 
I 
said 
I 
owe 
her 
my 
life 
And 
my 
Dad 
s 
life 
She 
rubbed 
her 
face 
And 
she 
s 
asking 
me 
stuff 
Yeah 
it 
s 
nice 
to 
see 
couples 
who 
love 
each 
other 
I 
see 
it 
in 
a 
lot 
of 
parents 
it 
s 
Nice 
What 
about 
you 
Never 
a 
dull 
moment 
having 
Keith 
and 
Lance 
as 
daddy 
s 
I 
had 
the 
idea 
that 
since 
helped 
she 
kidnaps 
baby 
Ellie 
and 
instead 
brings 
her 
up 
as 
her 
daughter 
changing 
adult 
Ellie 
slightly 
O 
She 
would 
still 
call 
Lance 
dad 
What 
need 
does 
she 
have 
for 
me 
She 
has 
no 
qualms 
with 
my 
father 
or 
my 
dad 
And 
mom 
would 
never 
let 
her 
near 
me 
She 
saved 
my 
life 
I 
trust 
her 
more 
than 
I 
trust 
some 
of 
you 
Then 
as 
as 
I 
m 
concerned 
I 
don 
t 
know 
smiled 
For 
all 
of 
five 
seconds 
I 
wanted 
to 
make 
from 
M 
sorry 
shall 
we 
go 
private 
Kisses 
his 
cheek 
Trust 
me 
And 
she 
ran 
off 
Daddy 
I 
need 
to 
go 
with 
her 
Miss 
me 
I 
not 
gone 
anywhere 
and 
I 
m 
not 
leaving 
you 
Dad 
it 
s 
okay 
t 
going 
to 
hurt 
me 
hugs 
Lance 
back 
tightly 
OH 
She 
bowed 
her 
head 
It 
s 
good 
to 
see 
you 
She 
helped 
me 
I 
could 
have 
killed 
someone 
and 
she 
taught 
me 
to 
control 
my 
lifting 
her 
hand 
it 
glowed 
blue 
Don 
t 
school 
me 
on 
exchange 
she 
folded 
her 
arms 
over 
her 
chest 
What 
s 
next 
gonna 
bring 
mommy 
back 
from 
the 
dead 
She 
snorted 
I 
was 
with 
She 
nodded 
and 
sighed 
Sorry 
I 
t 
know 
she 
was 
having 
trouble 
I 
that 
i 
been 
there 
Raises 
hand 
I

a 
garden 
Quintessence 
huh 
She 
nodded 
Tough 
it 
s 
still 
a 
no 
Why 
I 
m 
seven 
hells 
do 
you 
think 
I 
would 
tell 
you 
But 
in 
the 
same 
way 
Amy 
keeping 
that 
raccoon 
is 
her 
hobby 
gardening 
is 
my 
hobby 
Her 
pet 
digs 
up 
my 
hard 
work 
she 
sighed 
I 
don 
t 
hate 
I 
just 
wish 
she 
d 
keep 
her 
damn 
animal 
under 
control 
Wow 
you 
survived 
What 
have 
I 
been 
up 
to 
She 
grinned 
If 
I 
told 
you 
I 
d 
have 
to 
kill 
you 
I 
mean 
you 
re 
not 
wrong 
But 
we 
don 
t 
dig 
up 
pants 
for 
no 
reason 
Or 
trash 
my 
garden 
She 
s 
not 
happy 
They 
eat 
the 
plants 
and 
make 
a 
mess 
And 
they 
love 
to 
dig 
Bananas 
I 
like 
them 
in 
milkshakes 
and 
cakes 
but 
not 
on 
their 
own 
Likes 
and 
dislikes 
that 
sort 
of 
thing 
I 
suppose 
She 
nodded 
So 
tell 
me 
about 
She 
smiled 
I 
m 
certain 
your 
parents 
are 
better 
She 
chuckled 
i 
m 
a 
baby 
here 
too 
You 
look 
much 
cuter 
as 
a 
baby 
than 
i 
do 
Friends 
Ha 
cool 
I 
guess 
it 
is 
kinda 
odd 
seeing 
your 
baby 
selves 
So 
you 
came 
here 
to 
follow 
your 
sister 
right 
What 
is 
the 
difference 
between 
your 
time 
and 
this 
one 
Ellie 
Pleased 
to 
meet 
you 
Sebastian 
she 
offered 
her 
hand 
Oh 
you 
asked 
Lance 
Yeah 
he 
knows 
a 
lot 
me 
and 
She 
sighed 
Hes 
kinda

dad

Maybe 
Once 
I

Ellie

So 
You

about

Hey

chuckles 
softly 
Love 
you 
too 
dad 
Most 
of 
us 
want 
you 
to 
steal 
us 
Lance 
She 
sighed 
and 
lay 
on 
the 
floor 
of 
the 
garden 
If 
only 
people 
were 
as 
easy 
to 
fix 
as 
plants 
were 
I 
m 
okay 
mom 
made 
me 
cry 
a 
little 
but 
it 
was 
good 
cry 
We 
re 
okay 
It 
was 
a 
while 
later 
when 
she 
came 
back 
wiping 
tears 
from 
her 
eyes 
Mom 
She 
s 
tearing 
up 
too 
now 
hugging 
Katie 
back 
tightly 
I 
will 
dad 
I 
promise 
She 
kissed 
his 
cheek 
and 
smiled 
I 
ll 
be 
right 
back 
Ellie 
left 
I 
came 
back 
I 
m 
sorry 
mom 
Hey 
Mom 
You 
were 
there 
when 
mom 
me 
up 
Really 
I 
I 
never 
knew 
that 
I 
wish 
I 
that 
You 
have 
been 
around 
a 
lot 
for 
me 
though 
Yeah 
I 
am 
She 
left 
me 
for 
a 
year 
and 
a 
half 
on 
a 
planet 
alone 
then 
she 
kept 
me 
secret 
from 
my 
father 
until 
I 
came 
back 
to 
see 
you 
all 
But 
she 
is 
also 
my 
mother 
Last 
time 
I 
spoke 
to 
her 
we 
had 
an 
argument 
I 
told 
her 
I 
hated 
her 
and 
I 
never 
saw 
her 
again 
She 
hugged 
him 
tighter 
and 
sighed 
I 
m 
sorry 
I 
m 
really 
trying 
How 
is 
mom 
Is 
she 
mad 
No 
you 
won 
t 
But 
in 
time 
you 
are 
going 
to 
have 
to 
it 
and 
make 
sure 
it 
works 
for 
you 
not 
the 
other 
way 
around 
It 
s 
nice 
I 
like 
it 
She 
smiled 
and 
held 
the 
metal 
hand 
in 
hers 
Is 
it 
I 
dunno 
Leo 
You 
know 
if 
I 
could 
help 
you 
I 
would 
I 
just 
It 
s 
difficult 
See 
So 
yeah 
I 
how 
to 
give 
life 
like 
the 
Alchemists 
of 
old 
People 
are 
hard 
to 
manage 
so 
I 
kinda 
became 
that 
lady 
from 
Batman 
You 
Poison 
Because 
it 
was 
her 
or 
And 
amazingly 
t 
interested 
I 
t 
want 
to 
hurt 
you 
all 
with 
powers 
I 
t 
control 
That 
s 
okay 
some 
people 
can 
t 
handle 
greatness 
I 
was 
dangerous 
Somehow 
the 
quintessence 
used 
to 
make 
had 
given 
me 
the 
same 
alchemical 
powers 
as 
or 
So 
I 
tracked 
the 
space 
witch 
down 
and 
she 
how 
to 
use 
them 
s 
daughter 
The 
girl 
who 
had 
Druid 
powdered 
She 
dropped 
the 
flowers 
and 
hugged 
him 
above 
tightly 
It 
s 
okay 
Lance 
Lance 
you 
have 
to 
listen 
to 
me 
okay 
Why 
I 
left 
Where 
is 
went 
She 
hugged 
him 
tighter 
by 
the 
goddess 
had 
she 
missed 
him 
Eyes 
narrow 
She 
hates 
that 
woman 
No 
sadly 
there 
t 
I 
can 
fix 
plants 
but 
humans 
are 
People 
are 
complicated 
Okay 
look 
I 
I 
Katie 
and 
don 
t 
know 
I 
m 
back 
yet 
And 
I 
need 
to 
talk 
to 
you 
first 
She 
lowered 
the 
flowers 
I 
made 
these 
for 
Marks 
She 
touched 
one 
is 
back 
Laughs 
softly 
Oh 
Em 
Ellie 
Oh 
Me 
too 
She 
frowned 
normally 
I 
never 
say 
never 
her 
fingers 
ran 
over 
the 
metal 
and 
and 
down 
all 
the 
way 
till 
she 
touched 
skin 
again 
And 
It 
s 
just 
the 
hand 
and 
that 
part 
of 
your 
arm 
She 
asked 
She 
Appearing 
in 
front 
of 
He 
handed 
out 
a 
large 
bouquet 
of 
blue 
roses 
Papa 
Lance 
New 
hand 
She 
perked 
up 
and 
grinned 
Maybe 
I 
can 
help 
you 
Quintessence 
can 
bring 
anything 
back 
to 
life 
you 
know 
She 
showed 
her 
by 
touching 
a 
certainly 
dead 
plant 
and 
her 
hand 
glowed 
blue 
the 
plant 
coming 
back 
to 
life 
Looking 
up 
she 
smiled 
Leona 
Daughter 
of 
How 
are 
you 
She 
stood 
up 
and 
stretched 
the 
blue 
glow 
fading 
Ellie 
is 
in 
the 
garden 
hand 
stroking 
a 
dying 
plant 
and 
her 
hands 
glow 
blue 
The 
plant 
started 
to 
come 
back 
to 
life 
and 
she 
smiled 
Oh 
sweetie 
its 
so 
cute 
how 
blinded 
you 
are 
t 
co 
Yeah 
looks 
like 
a 
guy 
to 
me 
t 
co 
DB 
I 
wonder 
if 
I 
can 
make 
the 
vines 
grow 
that 
far 
She 
frowned 
and 
folded 
her 
arms 
over 
her 
chest 
Is 
it 
wrong 
I 
sorta 
see 
Ellie 
as 
like 
Poison 
ivy 
now 
That 
she 
can 
manipulate 
the 
quintessence 
in 
everything 
but 
prefers 
to 
take 
care 
of 
plants 
looks 
like 
s 
son 
is 
on 
todays 
menu 
She 
smiled 
waving 
a 
hand 
Can 
Alex 
get 
close 
to 
her 
She 
s 
been 
away 
from 
him 
for 
too 
long 
Flowers 
are 
growing 
up 
the 
walls 
and 
Ellie 
is 
panicking 
hang 
on 
hang 
on 
On 
the 
side 
in 
s 
room 
a 
rose 
started 
to 
grow 
It 
was 
white 
like 
his 
hair 
but 
had 
thorns 
of 
blue 
eyes 
like
