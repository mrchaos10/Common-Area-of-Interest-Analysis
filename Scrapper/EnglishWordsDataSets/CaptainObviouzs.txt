What 
a 
fucking 
loser 
to 
go 
through 
tweets 
to 
do 
this 
you 
need 
a 
life 
mate 
Send 
him 
to 
Italy 
to 
learn 
how 
to 
defend 
Liverpool 
and 
Spurs 
are 
the 
biggest 
bottle 
job 
teams 
in 
the 
league 
Don 
t 
want 
a 
manager 
who 
says 
trophies 
are 
not 
important 
So 
what 
De 
faced 
more 
shots 
because 
of 
united 
shit 
now 
Allison 
faces 
a 
few 
more 
than 
usual 
and 
he 
s 
letting 
in 
most 
of 
them 
Until 
he 
makes 
significant 
saves 
in 
a 
game 
that 
makes 
Liverpool 
win 
he 
is 
no 
where 
near 
De 
And 
Liverpool 
fans 
said 
he 
was 
better 
than 
De 
You 
are 
such 
a 
snowflake 
Fair 
play 
boys 
Would 
have 
finished 
anyway 
Jesus 
how 
many 
people 
have 
to 
die 
before 
someone 
admits 
there 
is 
a 
gun 
problem 
What 
you 
saying 
is 
literally 
means 
nothing 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
day 
every 
team 
should 
start 
at 
the 
bottom 
and 
work 
there 
way 
up 
irrespective 
of 
score 
lines 
or 
any 
of 
that 
shit 
They 
t 
even 
be 
given 
a 
chance 
to 
leapfrog 
the 
lower 
divisions 
Just 
because 
they 
are 
better 
than 
all 
those 
teams 
t 
mean 
that 
they 
should 
leap 
frog 
them 
in 
the 
league 
They 
need 
to 
prove 
that 
they 
are 
better 
than 
the 
lower 
league 
teams 
first 
It 
s 
retarded 
how 
you 
think 
that 
then 
going 
into 
the 
top 
league 
is 
fair 
it 
s 
the 
opposite 
It 
s 
not 
about 
bullying 
other 
teams 
It 
s 
about 
being 
fair 
If 
someone 
created 
a 
team 
and 
filled 
it 
with 
world 
class 
player 
they 
t 
be 
allowed 
to 
go 
into 
the 
top 
league 
they 
should 
start 
at 
the 
bottom 
It 
s 
not 
unfair 
unfair 
is 
putting 
a 
new 
team 
in 
the 
top 
league 
You 
can 
t 
just 
go 
straight 
to 
the 
top 
you 
should 
start 
at 
the 
bottom 
like 
everyone 
does 
How 
you 
think 
a 
team 
going 
straight 
into 
the 
top 
division 
is 
fair 
is 
beyond 
me 
Anytime 
citizen 
They 
conceded 
Fucking 
shambles 
back 
to 
the 
kitchen 
I 
say 
Don 
t 
mention 
the 
contradiction 
you 
made 
The 
facts 
are 
the 
majority 
of 
premier 
league 
fans 
don 
t 
know 
this 
guy 
If 
you 
want 
to 
argue 
that 
they 
will 
soon 
all 
know 
him 
then 
that 
s 
fine 
but 
he 
s 
not 
been 
covered 
enough 
for 
the 
majority 
of 
mainstream 
fans 
to 
know 
him 
Quite 
well 
known 
nice 
contradiction 
if 
he 
s 
so 
covered 
as 
you 
say 
surely 
he 
should 
be 
more 
than 
quite 
well 
know 
Wow 
people 
liked 
your 
tweet 
I 
d 
like 
to 
see 
the 
analytics 
of 
how 
many 
have 
seen 
it 
Argue 
all 
you 
like 
hardly 
anyone 
knew 
who 
this 
was 
before 
January 
You 
can 
defend 
it 
all 
you 
want 
the 
facts 
remain 
majority 
of 
people 
have 
no 
clue 
who 
he 
is 
he 
t 
been 
covered 
as 
much 
as 
you 
make 
out 
people 
STILL 
don 
t 
know 
who 
he 
is 
after 
the 
transfer 
and 
there 
will 
be 
plenty 
on 
match 
day 
asking 
who 
he 
is 
as 
well 
Yeah 
of 
course 
you 
do 
weeks 
ago 
majority 
of 
premiership 
fans 
had 
no 
idea 
who 
this 
is

he 
t 
that 
well 
covered 
it 
s 
not 
as 
though 
everyone 
has 
been 
talking 
about 
him 
When 
the 
majority 
of 
people 
have 
no 
clue 
who 
he 
is 
then 
the 
saying 
you 
have 
been 
living

Couple 
of

reasons

me 
and

The

No

anyway 
that 
free 
kick 
was 
awful 
i 
d 
like 
you 
to 
get 
a 
clip 
of 
a 
bad 
touch 
he 
made 
that 
game 
cause 
I 
one 
Don 
t 
think 
he 
actually 
shot 
today 
mate 
He 
held 
the 
ball 
up 
on 
the 
right 
and 
made 
simple 
forward 
passes 
And 
when 
he 
did 
fuck 
up 
it 
was 
attempting 
to 
go 
forward 
You 
watch 
the 
game 
What 
part 
of 
that 
performance 
was 
shit 
Cheers

Too

He 
s 
just 
saying 
that

I 
d 
like 
to 
be 
positive

time

it

he 
might 
say 
he 
t

but 
he 
got

pounded 
It 
might 
have 
been 
a 
tiny 
bit 
early 
but 
he
