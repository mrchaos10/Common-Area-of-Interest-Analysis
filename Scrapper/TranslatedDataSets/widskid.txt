The 178-hour period that you have for one week runs out without leaving 2 hours minimum to study with which is the reason for the ease of going to Allah's paradise jalla dzikruhu? 
For that I appeal to myself & amp; friends to prepare their time to study the Islamic science in accordance with the Qur'an and Al Hadits / Sunnah Rasulullah ﷺ ... so that we are not included in 72 firqah (groups) astray in Islam who are all in hell ... 
If damage to tauhid (the main key to Islam) is maintained, how do you want to enter Jannah ??? If it's far from ittiba 'to Rasullulah ﷺ, how does this life want to be easy & amp; how do you want to drink from the lake of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in the hereafter ??? 
One more thing, the lack of rules "religion with theorem" is the cause of the destruction of their manhaj ... so far from the teachings exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad Muhammad and prefers to do what is not exemplified ... 
Even as simple as the most fundamental science of tauhid is the entire prophet & amp; the apostle does not know a lot, so syubhat and misguided thoughts that take Islam or even not from Islam so easy to enter ... 
Nowadays Muslims: have been contaminated with a lot of love because of the lack of interest in studying Islam that haq ... the period when all religions are considered good & amp; the same, there are those who say Allah mana everywhere, the government is wrongly said to be infidels (where have they diligently worshiped?)

Indeed, Allah will not forgive the sin of shirk, and He forgives all sins other than that, for whom He wills. Whoever associates God, then indeed he has committed a great sin "(QS An Nisaa ': 48) 
The meaning of this hadith is the word of Allah Ta'ala, 
 
إن الله لايففر أن يشرك به ويففر منهم ذلك لمن يشآء ومن يشرك بالله فقد افترى إثما عظيما {48} 
"Allah said: 'O son of Adam, if you come to Me with a complete fault of the earth, then you come to Me without associating anything with Me, then I will come to you with full forgiveness of the earth" (Narrated by Tirmidhi 3540 ) 
Rasulullah sallallaahu 'alaihi wa salaam said, 
 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): "Son of man, if you bring me the sins of the earth, then you will receive me. 
Even though it is only by being full of monotheism that sin is as much as the foam in the ocean can be forgiven and one of the keys to becoming an expert on heaven ... is the proposition? 
It's a shame, who is often more afraid of being a superior than a rabbi? Often ga believes in his taqdir (the rububiyah tauhid), worshiping him is merely reluctant (tauhid uluhiyah), and does not feel always supervised or muraqabah (tauhid asma 'wa shifat) 
Be honest before you practice .. 
No really knows but Him, Allah ﷻ
