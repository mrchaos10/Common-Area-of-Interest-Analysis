@kirstyjean @handee @toggl For toggl I have a “general email” project that is for when I’m screwing about in the browser not focused working on a project. (Whole days can go on this if I’m not careful - and that’s one of the reasons for tracking!!)

@_aquic_ @rossdavism @Hao_and_Y What are your criteria for best? Do you think they’re the same as mine? Is assessing the success of knowledge generation the same that of a sports player? Should it be? 
 
(You don’t need to reply. These are rhetorical questions.) 
 
 
@betatim @choldgraf Let’s make a 1 pager that explains this. You know. After we’ve done ALL THE OTHER THINGS. 
I was chatting w @npscience last week and she commented that open projects just don’t have the time/person hours to collect their metrics. I think this is a great example of that problem. 
 
I’ve been talking about this at the Turing for 2 years. People who hold the purse strings &amp; assess success are willing to learn, but we have to tell them what we want! 
 
I don’t know if I agree that small projects don’t need much resources though. I guess I’m interested in seeing how you can reward that 10% (usually more) of time at work more explicitly than “thanks for looking the other way”. 
OMFG. And if you edit anything it just automatically sends. I’m done. I’m off to bed. Really this time. 
 
Listen. What we’re learning here is that hootsuite is harder than you’d imagine.

@AilsaDon I consider myself lucky that I haven't sat on that many committees that do this (although now you mention it, the most useless of them absolutely do!) So frustrating to have minutes taking for bureaucratic reasons rather than actually being useful! https://t.co/dv1N2UIhqd 
@AilsaDon Sorry - I had taken the circulation directly after the meeting to be implicit. Thanks for clarifying. 
@vcheplygina @dna_heligrace So fun! I love this! 
@Dr_Rosti But actually learning from each other and building community is an awesome outcome and - in my experience - really motivating! 
@Dr_Rosti Yep - I think that's the goal. I've been in lab meetings (similar to the meetings in the blog post) where the PI just goes around and says: what have you done (where's my paper?) to each person. And those are exhausting, stressful and useless. 
@sanli Also, LOVE that the ECRs designed the meeting. That's the most useful and empowering aspect I think! 
@sanli My experience has been that its often hard to get people asking questions for things they need help on at the start of the meeting....but by the end there are often lots of discussion going! I'm really interested in trying to get that interesting conversation started earlier!

@Jade_Pickering The end of the year is a long way off, but let them decide if it’s “too far” and give them every opportunity to fundraise to build another position for you ready for Jan 2020! 4/4 
@Jade_Pickering The hardest part of making a decision to hire someone is knowing that it takes a long time to get someone up to speed, and that there are some applicants for whom that takes a lot longer than others. 3/ 
@Jade_Pickering My suspicion is that if they didn’t get good applicants they’ll delay for you. If they did then the’ll consider new positions for when you’re ready. 2/

@BMatB There’s a kindness and courtesy in switching to the common language so that everyone in the group can understand. If you (and I) can only understand English then that’s what we have to ask from our colleagues. 
If you want to kick back in the break room and shoot the sh*t with your friends, oh my freaking goodness, you do that. 
If you’re in the UK (these folks are in the US, we have the same majority language in academic institutions) you are SURROUNDED by people speaking English all the time. 
 
Your English is improving every day. Otherwise you wouldn’t be able to function at work. 
If you’re talking about something that doesn’t involve me, it doesn’t freaking matter what language you’re using! 
 
If you speak with your friend to try to clarify something I’ve said in a different language that ONLY BENEFITS ME. 
Good. Grief. 
 
It’s never occurred to me to add to my lab’s code of conduct that it’s ok to speak whatever language you freaking feel like - at work, at home and wherever you g-damned please.

@DrAndrewV2 So - it *is* facetious the way we’re phrasing it now, BUT it’s also exactly true. The reputational damage of researchers publishing work that is then slammed in the press is a huge factor. Not my personal motivation, but how we’ve got buy in at the Turing!!

@itjohnstone Yes. I’ve sometimes phrased this as “people before us have done bad stuff, so now we can’t have nice things”. We have to build the trust back up even if an individual researcher has never done anything wrong. 
@itjohnstone I’m not trying to be sanctimonious by the way - I’m trying to acknowledge that everyone is motivated for different reasons. Which is why a battery of them is super helpful! No point in trying to get everyone to think like me :) 
@itjohnstone I completely agree with this. And it isn’t my personal motivation (I subscribe to “do no harm” and I personally care about the impact of the work) but this is a strong point that I’ve used with others as a “selfish long term reason” to do ethical research :) 
Specific request from this researcher is that the ethics committee think about the ethical considerations. 
 
I think this can’t be as effective as getting the researchers to think about the consequences of their actions...but that approach hasn’t worked! #AutomatingTheCrowd

@samhforbes What I mean by “not using issues” is the use of them as a project management tool, or a place to have discussions and get feedback. Most folks think of them only for bugs. 
@samhforbes My other big recommendation is to remember that *git* and *GitHub* are very different skill sets. I know lots of people who are git wizards but don’t know how to do a pull request and don’t use issues. So train for both skills 
@samhforbes My philosophy is to focus on the in lab training and build up confidence so they can make later projects open if they’d like. 
I know it isn’t perfect but I think it’s really hard for folks who aren’t used to GitHub to “air their dirty laundry” while they’re learning.

@DimitraBlana @choldgraf @mybinderteam @rachaelevelyn @turinginst Another aspect of our project is to run a research software engineering focused workshop to try to build up capacity for folks in universities in the UK to host binder hubs themselves. THEN you can work with sensitive data more easily. 
@DimitraBlana @choldgraf @mybinderteam @rachaelevelyn @turinginst Yay!! Loved that talk at Turing! 
 
The point about setting up environments being hard is A HUGE motivation for me to promote binder!! 
How sensitive is the data you work with? That’s a challenge with the *public* binderhub (not if you can host your own)

https://t.co/46jmytQblM 
One last big share before the deadline on THURSDAY 17 JAN!! 
 
As I’ve said over and over in all my various tweet threads over the last few weeks: 
 
I BELIEVE IN YOU. 
 
Specific technical experience is not as important as your ability to learn new skills and to communicate across diverse communities. 
 
https://t.co/a4cEpKPBfJ 
Show me that you’ve thought about it. Show me that you share our values (or how you’d prefer to enhance them). 
 
 
Make it easy for me to check the box that says YOU are the best fit for the role. 
Let’s try to wrap up. 
DO link your CV and cover letter to the requirements and the responsibilities of the role. 
 
DO NOT go through the items on the job ad one by one in order. 
 
CURATE your application. 
(I’ve just realised how ironic it is that I’m writing a massive tweet thread about being brief. Whoooops!) https://t.co/tZJ1GSggfq 
 
You can’t tell me your whole life story. 
Use the cover letter to focus my attention on aspects of your CV, but don’t repeat them! 
As with “I’m a clear communicator” saying “I’m a good collaborator” doesn’t carry much weight. 
 
TELL ME of your collaborative successes. Model best practice by celebrating others in your teams. Make me excited to work with you! 
What are you excited about? Why would this position be a useful stepping stone on your career path? Why are you a great fit for the goals? 
 
What do you bring that the team doesn’t have? What will I learn from you? 
An essential requirement is that you have an understanding of #Autism, #Neurodiversity, and the barriers faced by members of traditionally underrepresented groups. 
 
This is difficult to show on your CV. But there are SO MANY WAYS you can tell your story in your cover letter. https://t.co/3wI7QyAo1L 
This is the place to communicate that you UNDERSTAND THE JOB. 
 
Read the values document. 
Think about why this position aligns with your career goals. 
 
TELL ME THAT STORY. 
https://t.co/EbbymgcedD 
On the other hand, if your cover letter is more than 2 pages I’m going to be suspicious. 
 
With effort &amp; a lot of thought, you CAN write a shorter letter. 
 
I don’t think with all the requirements in this job ad that you can submit 1 page (KUDOS if you can though!) but 2 is enough. 
I don’t mind how long your CV is. (Academic CVS can be pages and pages. This is NOT the case in most areas!) 
 
But it has to be easy to scan. 
 
Bullet points and links are lovely. 
And now let me transition to the cover letter by reiterating that formatting in your CV is SO SO SO important. 
 
 
LESS IS MORE. 
Imagine I have to go and justify why I want you to a big senior person. (This isn’t the case, but imagine!) 
 
Which lines in the document am I going to point to? 
My biggest piece of advice is HELP ME HELP YOU. 
 
I WANT to hire you. 
 
Advocate for yourself in the CV. 
 
Go through the job description and make sure that every piece of experience that provides evidence for why you can do this job is IN THE DOCUMENT! https://t.co/LmT5C9cNAP 
 
If you try to say you have a great “ability to communicate clearly and effectively” in your cover letter you’re just wasting words. 
SHOW ME that you can do this! Given talks? Got any teaching/training experience? Written blogs? Made YouTube videos? Links please! https://t.co/DK6edfxJXm 
Make sure that the most relevant pieces of experience are on your CV!! Don’t follow a standard template without thinking about it. 
 
This job ad has a HUGE list of requirements. You do not have space to address all of them in your cover letter. So make sure they’re in your CV! 
The reason I ask for a CV is because I want to see where you’ve been. 
 
Your cover letter is going to tell me where you want to go (and maybe draw some attention to highlights of your past) but the CV tells me what you’ve done so far. 
Let’s start with the CV. 
 
No one is going to read this in depth until the interview. 
 
FORMATTING is key. 
 
Make sure that it is incredibly easy to scan your CV and pull out key achievements. 
Here’s a screenshot of the application procedure from the job ad. It asks for a CV, contact details of your referees, and a covering letter. 
 
Not much, right? 
 
I think this makes the application pretty freaking hard! Let me explain why. https://t.co/0ZXZQrFgGT 
Let’s start by saying these are only my opinions. I’ll justify them so I hope they make sense to you. But different selection committees will have different requirements. Don’t over generalise to different positions :) 
 
I’m going to give you my opinions on how to write a good cover letter. I hope they’re helpful!

Please let me know if you have any questions. And please share widely!! 
 
Here's a thread of threads about the post that I've written over the last couple of weeks: https://t.co/8tosB2xtIF 
The postholder will have a lot to be working on! And it's all #participatory so the exact work will have to be designed, and developed. 
 
But the core values are fixed. We stand together. 
 
(The exact wording can be adjusted if they're badly phrased - please send any suggestions!!) 
The same document has our outcomes: 
 
✨ Online #CitizenScientist platform 
✨ Curated #FAIR dataset 
✨ Two (hopefully overlapping) #Communities (#CitizenScientists and #Developers) 
✨ A few suggested publications to share what we've learned 
 
https://t.co/EbbymgcedD https://t.co/MO9GNmz2a3 
A lot of these values are overlapping. They all define ways of working to ensure an #Open and #Participatory community where everyone is welcome. 
 
What I love about these is how - when I re-read them - I can see so clearly the ways they will empower us to build and grow our team. 
RESPECTFUL CONDUCT 
 
We will not tolerate #bullying or #harassment. We will ensure that all community members have accessible pathways to report unacceptable conduct. No member of the team is above the requirement to treat each other with #respect and #acceptance. https://t.co/88QLou84bJ 
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION 
 
We are committed to #equity for all. All members of the project will be expected to recognise and identify barriers to inclusion and actively work to remove them. We will build and maintain a community that is supportive of difference. https://t.co/JSIhhJZw0d 
OPEN SOURCE 
 
While the data will be available under managed access, all code and protocols will be build openly and shared with an #OpenSource license to permit the highest levels of adoption, re-use and improvement. https://t.co/GjgQpv3DlH 
PROTECTION AND CONSENT 
 
We will maintain the highest ethical standards of #DataManagement and #DataProtection. We will build accessible and transparent consent models - in collaboration with the #Autistic #CitizenScientists to ensure these are clear and meet their needs. https://t.co/3uLSEqYyOL 
TRANSPARENCY 
 
We'll explain our aims and motivations at the start and stay in contact with our community regarding future collaborations, who has access to the data, and WHY they're working with it. (And ensure contributors can revoke consent for these extensions as they prefer). https://t.co/erYcm48oeV 
PARTICIPATORY SCIENCE 
 
This project will be built in deep collaboration with the #Autistic #CitizenScience contributors. 
 
This value is heavily inspired and informed by the #NothingAboutUsWithoutUs philosophy from #DisabilityRights advocacy https://t.co/1xUMFJOwFV https://t.co/eHcllvrPoS 
IMPACT 
 
Now, I hate the term impact because its been ruined by the marketisation of academia via the REF. But in this context impact means we are committed to doing work that positively impacts #Autistic people's lives as quickly as possible. https://t.co/Ee3HDU9qJM 
The values are only loosely ordered. Don’t read too much into which ones come first etc. They’re ALL important. 
 
When you apply for the job PLEASE address the values in your cover letter. It’s an essential requirement that you have a commitment to these values. https://t.co/xvzSYetmJS 
The values are attached as a pdf to the job description linked above. Here’s the direct link: https://t.co/EbbymgcedD

@Jenn__Layton @simonredding Thank you!! Really appreciate you sharing :) 
Here's a thread in answer to a great question about the "fine-grained consent model" that we'll be building to ensure that this #participatory #CitizenScience project is as #ethical and responsible as possible https://t.co/67Tu7gtdeJ 
Here's a thread about the #PhD requirement.....and the fact that I'm very serious about the "or equivalent experience" part!! https://t.co/6Z9nVvCzw8 
Here's a thread talking about the #FullStack requirements....and why you DON'T need to know ALL THE THINGS in order to apply! https://t.co/j60NTHarSF 
In this thread I tell you about my motivations for designing the study in the first place https://t.co/huzv1a9e7M 
I know I'm tweeting up a STORM about this amazing job with @AutisticaUK to be based at @turinginst &amp; working with me! 
 
DEADLINE 17 JANUARY | https://t.co/VsC6sQps1s 
 
Super happy to answer any questions, and I do think this is a big chunk of REALLY VALUABLE work. Just think of the impact we can have on #tech if we show that individuals being informed and empowered to manage their own data can be done! https://t.co/6dX2ea4BJf 
My personal gut feeling is that this will be a lot of thinking and "stakeholder engagement" work....but I'm quite confident that much of the technical components have already been developed! I just don't think they've all been incorporated into a project like this one before! 
2) There are great teams who are already thinking about these sorts of data control models. @OpenHumansOrg in particular have already reached out about working with them to build a first version. 
Regarding @pandamakes question about how much work this is. There are two answers: 
 
1) It will take time. The project is #participatory so it will be designed and built with our #Autistic collaborators. We'll iterate with them on what needs to be built. 
SO we need a fine-grained consent model! 
 
Every individual contributor needs to be able to have complete control over their data. 
 
They aren't going to be signing up for some generic T&amp;Cs and losing sight of what's happening! 
We'll also maintain the database to be #FAIR under managed access. Maybe other researchers would like to better understand #Autism from the data? Some #Autistic contributors will want to take part in that work, others may not. 
BUT another goal is to build a database that can be used for research purposes. Maybe we can run the stories through an #NLP (natural language processing) algorithm to cluster them together? Some #CitizenScientist contributors will be ok with that. Others would prefer not. 
One of the goals of the project is to build community between #Autistic people. Ideally they'll feel a little less alone in these challenges, share coping strategies &amp; support each other. A #CitizenScientist might be totally fine with sharing their stories for that purpose. 
But you could imagine a different example that was outside someone's house where they're happy to upload the story for researchers to use to understand #Autistic people's experiences, but they don't want to it to be public. 
You can imagine someone uploading an experience that is general enough that they're happy to make totally public. Similar to a tweet! "I'm on the jubilee line and there are far too many people, its making me feel panicky" (for example). 
In this #CitizenScience project we'll be collecting experiences about the challenges that #Autistic people have when navigate the environment. 
 
For example, is it very stressful to take the tube? (Yes!) Are there times that are particularly bad? (Yes!) What are the workarounds? 
What do I mean by a "fine-grained consent model"? At the highest level it's pretty simple: it means I want to give all the participants control over their data. 
 
What does that mean in practise? 
Great question from @pandamakes about the @AutisticaUK @turinginst #ResearchAssociate JOB that you should all be applying for (and telling your friends about). https://t.co/VsC6sQps1s

@yoyehudi @MozOpenLeaders That’s one of my biggest frustrations about job ads! They’re often so generic they lack all meaning. I think that’s why we end up hiring to the status quo so much. 
 
@yoyehudi I had someone EXACTLY like you in my head when I was designing the role!! 
 
 
AND TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW about the job!!! 
 
https://t.co/5lfAeiDcKI 
Stay tuned for a thread tomorrow about #OpenSource and the #Community we’ll need in the project. 
 
There’s NO reason why you can’t have those skills from outside academia! 
 
Please do not let the PhD requirement stop you from applying. 
 
The post is probably not suitable for someone just out of undergrad....but never say never! Who know’s what path you’ve taken to get there!! 
BUT! You do not have to have a PhD to fulfil these requirements!! 
 
You will need evidence of independent leadership (of a project or of a team), of looking for solutions to problems (sometimes of your own divising) and of communicating what you’ve learned and what you’ve created. 
Not all doctoral programmes provide that opportunity, but many do. And so the point of requiring a PhD for this job is that the post holder needs to be able to see or create a path to building that new knowledge.....and that’s one of the key outcomes of a PhD (in my opinion!) 
And I think the outcome of that is that you can generate NEW knowledge by the end. 
I don’t think this means significant results. Nor expanding a theory. Nor a new method. 
 
I think it means contributing to making the world a better place by adding useful information. 
I tweeted yesterday about the #FullStack requirements of this job. 
 
It seems pretty silly to require web development skills AND a PhD! They aren’t usually taught together.

I don’t think anyone thought this would be easy - but it’s still fascinating to think through balancing multiple objectives for the “best” design #TuringDSED https://t.co/vGZN01OT9B 
RT @DoE_S3Ri: #TuringDSED Stefanie Biedermann from @unisouthampton discussing optimal design for kinetic models. #doe #stats https://t.co/g… 
So excited to have you here Charlotte - getting the design of experiments right at the start makes your life sooooooo much easier in the future! #TuringDSED https://t.co/ICd0IHP18V 
Here’s an example (I’ve missed a few slides - stay tuned for the videos of the talks being posted online next week) but what’s interesting is how far ahead you need to look - what you are going to do with the data tells you what data you need to collect! #TuringDSED https://t.co/Liqb8OLnrm 
We can’t do EVERY experiment that we want to do - there are resource limitations (time, money, logistics) - so how do we decide which measurements to take? Biedermann talks us through the process for designing the optimal experiment! #TuringDSED https://t.co/yqQwTg7RKt 
#TuringDSED https://t.co/GoDg8wZktc 
#TuringDSED https://t.co/kg6c0OmAr2 
Stephanie Biedermann from @unisouthampton is our first speaker - she’s a statistician and is going to focus on how we build optimal designs for experiments #TuringDSED https://t.co/sQWEV5qIrZ 
STAY IN TOUCH! We’re building a community around #DataScience for #ExperimentalDesign @turinginst! If you can’t be here today you can still be part of taking this work forwards! #TuringDSED https://t.co/GKZU9SaMoI 
We have four sections to the event: designing, performing and analysing our experiments AND learning from sociologists &amp; ethnographers about HOW we can change academic culture to improve interdisciplinary work! #TuringDSED https://t.co/NW61k1TXZS 
The wonderful @RegulatoryNet getting us started at #TuringDSED describing what we’re hoping to achieve today - improving science to make it more efficient and effective! https://t.co/s4sBiDv6YV 
I know you’ve seen this picture before - but here it is on @RegulatoryNet’s opening slides for the #TuringDSED event! Really delighted that so many people are interested in this aspect of the @turinginst challenge: #DataScience for #Science! https://t.co/cJq7UDLFfX
