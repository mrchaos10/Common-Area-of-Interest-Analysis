not even criticizing because i've been there. just being real.

@JasmineGingrich please tell me you're not fucking joking 
@kam4398 i just love my sleep 
@kam4398 our schedules conflict 
i'm pretty exhausted for someone who got almost 9 hours of sleep.

even white people get annoyed with white people. 
logan has been somewhat needy lately. 
i have 0 complaints. 
demand my attention as much as you want. i fucking love that shit. 
@Cstoneyyy "boneless wings are like nuggets. bunch of tards." - logan rolle
