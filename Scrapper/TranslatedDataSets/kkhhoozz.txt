@SmArT__sA Yakhiiiii Khalassts and God until Zidane and God 
@SmArT__sA logo above all pure ones 
But Ronaldo without him Real Madrid 
Lige IV 
I say we play against a strong team in the role of the 16 and we know Azin that the lottery will be easy and slack

The disaster is frank in the Bernabeu 
If we beat the second half 
Madri is forbidden and God is great
