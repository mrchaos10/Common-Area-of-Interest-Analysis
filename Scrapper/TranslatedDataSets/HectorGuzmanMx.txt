I hope 2019 becomes the year of GDPR-hard-enforcement as well as the year where we will seriously spread the word: 
It's the INDIVIDUALS, not #DATA, stupid! 
I truly understand that in countries w/o data protection laws it may be hard to assimilate that the law shall protect INDIVIDUALS, not their data 
 
I also understand that certain laws wrongfully point their protection on DATA instead of INDIVIDUALS... this shall change, of course 
Maybe we have taken for granted a lot of things. 
 
Maybe we haven't sufficiently explained this: 
 
"The protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right." (Recital 1. GDPR) 
 
See? 
The law protects NATURAL PERSONS, not DATA. 
Reading this from @TheEconomist provides an overlook of how far we are from understanding what #DataProtection and #Privacy are about. 
 
I'm starting to think that "Data Protection" may be a failed concept.

You can see specific information on the "adequacy decisions" of the European Commission in this link: 
 
https://t.co/aSpwt3hhro 
The accession of #MX is very important ... and that we have laws and #INAI is also; but this is not a "self-proclamation" and for all purposes in our relations with the EU, we have not yet been recognized as a country with an equivalent level of protection. 
In this sense, and however much it likes or dislikes, the only vehicle for recognizing a "third country" outside the EU as a safe destination or with an "adequate level of protection" to personal data is the one that appears in the DECISIONS of the European Commission. 
#WRONG!!! 
 
They can not ignore that since the time of Directive 95/46 / EC the "recognitions" of "adequate level" are "granted" by the European Commission through DECISIONS of adequacy. 
 
This recognition vehicle is now regulated by Article 45 of the #RGPD. 
1. The country has a data protection law. 
2. The country has a national data protection authority (the #INAI), and, above all, 
3. Because Mexico has just joined the # Convention108 and for that reason the Eurepea Union WE HAVE RECOGNIZED as a country with an adequate level ... 
Three weeks later they transferred a copy of the opinion of their lawyers, which in essence indicated: 
 
They do not need to sign these clauses, because Mexico IS a destination that provides an adequate level of protection of personal data given that: 
In the absence of #CBRs, we transfer to the person in charge the Responsible-Manager Contractual Clauses that we would have to sign to implement this transfer. 
 
The manager indicated that he would analyze the proposal with his lawyers. 
We recently indicated to an EU-based official that in order to transfer (send) personal data to a manager located in #MX, they would have to comply with art.46 of the #RGPD, given that we have not yet been recognized as a destination with a level adequate protection. 
This Decree entered into force on 1/10/18 and since then has given much to talk about in our country (and it is not for less, because it is a big step and an important distinction); however, I have found that adherence to # Convention108 has given rise to confusion. 
 
I explain: 
As you know, on 09/28/18 was published in the #DOF the Promulgatory DECREE of the Additional Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Persons with respect to the Automated Treatment of Personal Data (# Convenio108).

In summary, it is time to stop the myth: the provision of personal data on the Internet in no way authorizes your treatment for any purpose; the context and the purpose of its place of publication are decisive. 
However, it takes a lot of imagination (and even bad faith) to argue that the publication of my certain account on the website of my work is intended (or "authorizes", for being there) the sending of unsolicited advertising and offers to the sender himself. 
Yes we publish (or our company publishes) our corporate email in the web of our place of work, it does not take a PhD to understand that the purpose is the contact for business purposes. 
We must stop dreaming that the information on the Internet pages is freely available. 
 
For example, the publication of personal data on a corporate website has several PURPOSES, which do not require express declarations to limit its scope. 
My next battle (of months, it is foreseen) will be to clarify why the publication of #DatosPersonales on the Internet (like my professional email account) does not mean making it available for any type of purpose, for any person.

If you do not analyze all the treatments, you'll end up doing "jewelry" like that.

@albero @fjavier_sempere @RAEinforma Something like that also said @adsuara, but the explanation is simple and the answer was given by @RAEinforma, not Fundeu. 
 
 
@RAEinforma has said that if the translation adopted into Spanish of the word "regulation" is "regulation", then by using the acronym GDPR it is correct to use "the" GDPR. 
 
In English "regulation" is a neutral noun, it is irrelevant to determine that article. 
@albero @fjavier_sempere 1. "regulation" is not a feminine noun; neither male. 
2. We already saw this with @RAEinforma; The correct way to say it is "EL" GDPR and the explanation is here:

That is the reason, too, that they avoid external audits when it comes to compliance issues.

You can go to a stationery store and ask for a LETTER OF POWDER template. 
@fjavier_sempere @pgarcia_gir @Jorge_Morell @iurisfriki In Mexico, the happy LETTER POWER is commonly used, through which you can ask a third party to represent you in certain procedures. 
 
In the case of a foreigner, if he does not do it by himself, he should look for the best means to grant representation. 
It is an unfortunate wording, but in reality it says that you can exercise the rights FOR YOURSELF, or through a 3rd person who must present a POWER LETTER that, on a daily basis, is signed by two witnesses. 
It does NOT indicate that you need two witnesses to exercise rights.

@RicardoGower @SolMaqueo @JonathanLpezTor @rsperrilliat @RigobertoMtzB @AMDImx @cvquezada @academiamxdatos @vanediazrod @thesiu_ As a corollary: 
A MANAGER who handles the data in violation of his obligations with such, "becomes" RESPONSIBLE for the data, but in violation of the LFPD from the beginning (simply, and to begin with, does not have your consent to treat your data). It is a subtlety. 
@RicardoGower @SolMaqueo @JonathanLpezTor @rsperrilliat @RigobertoMtzB @AMDImx @cvquezada @academiamxdatos @vanediazrod @thesiu_ As I usually say: we'll see. 
(I regret that you have suffered a violation of the law) 
(I'm glad you decided to report, to clarify things) 
@RicardoGower @SolMaqueo @JonathanLpezTor @rsperrilliat @RigobertoMtzB @AMDImx @cvquezada @academiamxdatos @vanediazrod @thesiu_ I know multinationals that, with other armies of lawyers, have not been able to avoid millions in fines from INAI. 
The burden of proof is on the person in charge, always ... it should be they who provide the forensic evidence, if the violation is evident and stands on its own. 
Part of the challenges of any State to adapt are efficiency to those advances. 
@RicardoGower @SolMaqueo @JonathanLpezTor @rsperrilliat @RigobertoMtzB @AMDImx @cvquezada @academiamxdatos @vanediazrod @thesiu_ Arts. 67 and 68 of the LFPD: Of the Crimes in the Matter of the Undue Treatment of Personal Data. 
It's federal matter. 
Illustrates the PGR in what it already investigates. 
@RicardoGower @SolMaqueo @JonathanLpezTor @rsperrilliat @RigobertoMtzB @AMDImx @cvquezada @academiamxdatos @vanediazrod @thesiu_ Understanding. 
You do well not to give more info. 
If you have come to verification, it is good news. 
@RicardoGower @SolMaqueo @JonathanLpezTor @rsperrilliat @RigobertoMtzB @AMDImx @cvquezada @academiamxdatos @vanediazrod @thesiu_ I understand. Yes, you denuced I got your tweet later. 
@RicardoGower @SolMaqueo @JonathanLpezTor @rsperrilliat @RigobertoMtzB @AMDImx @cvquezada @academiamxdatos @vanediazrod @thesiu_ Who leaked your files is the first "legal responsible" for such leak. 
If the outsourcing got your files from the person in charge (or a manager), you also have responsibility for having obtained them without your consent ... and the FintTech, if you hurry me, did you report? 
 
The change was necessary and that was what was adopted. 
 
It does not work in our country because the law "forgot" to include the person in charge as a subject of sanctions. 
@RicardoGower @SolMaqueo @JonathanLpezTor @rsperrilliat @RigobertoMtzB @AMDImx @cvquezada @academiamxdatos @vanediazrod @thesiu_ If we bought this idea, cloud computing would not be possible in Mexico. 
 
Outsourcing is necessary, in the same way as the reform that you indicate, so that each party is "responsible" for what is theirs. 
@RicardoGower @SolMaqueo @JonathanLpezTor @rsperrilliat @RigobertoMtzB @AMDImx @cvquezada @academiamxdatos @vanediazrod @thesiu_ The above does not mean that in a contract for the provision of services with a RESPONSIBLE MANAGER a well advised can not include a clause of civil liability and compensation for damages. It is not incompatible with the LFPD. 
@RicardoGower @SolMaqueo @JonathanLpezTor @rsperrilliat @RigobertoMtzB @AMDImx @cvquezada @academiamxdatos @vanediazrod @thesiu_ The co-responsibility of data processing is another figure, which our law has not yet incorporated; that would also be a pending and desirable change. 
 
See art. 26 of the RGPD, for example. 
@RicardoGower @SolMaqueo @JonathanLpezTor @rsperrilliat @RigobertoMtzB @AMDImx @cvquezada @academiamxdatos @vanediazrod @thesiu_ The figure of the ENCARGADO must exist because the provision of a service does not enable that provider to process the data beyond the service contracted. The change must be given on the responsibility of the ENCARGADO when it fails, and on the RESPONSIBLE who chose it ...

Of course, in Spanish it is appropriate to say "the #RGPD", but I insist that the English acronym has been imposed.

@adsuara @RAEinforma @Fundeu And "the RGPD", please! 
 
Not only are references to "the #GDPR" still circulating, but now the "#RGPD" is also seen.

@Compliancero I have not seen the pure obligation as such ... what I do conceive are fat and sensitive commissions that generate a competitive advantage for those ET that want to anticipate the wishes of their clients. 
@Compliancero I understand what you say. 
 
The question is based on a literal reading of 35.1, in which only the person in charge is mentioned ... as if the managers could not (or should not) make PIAs.

Unless otherwise stated by @adsuara, this debate is settled. 
He made it very clear @RAEinforma: 
 
"It will depend on the grammatical gender of the substantive noun of the English expression that has been fixed in the translation into Spanish:" the ", if it is" regulation "," the ", if it is" regulation "." 
 
 
The official and legal translation of the term "Regulation" is "Regulation". 
 
That's what friends told me when I told them about my test. 
 
The official and legal translation of the term "Regulation" is "Regulation". 
For the above, and with support in the additional opinion of @RAEinforma, it should be said «the RGPD». 
@jlcendrero @adsuara Good! 
 
Of course, this is prior to the moment I adopted Spain as my second home. 
 
@Fundeu @adsuara @RAEinforma I agree with the rigor, noting further that although the term "Regulation" can pass in free translation as "regulation", the official and legal translation of that word is "Regulation". 
Therefore, I think that it should be said "the RGPD".

@adsuara @RAEinforma @Fundeu I agree! 
 
"The GDPR" ... I do not know ... it's missing if you say THE and then GDPR in Spanish, right? 
When I do it, I say: 
 
I use many acronyms in English (maybe too many). 
I think that the article applicable to the Spanish translation should be put forward 
e.g. The WIPO ... by "organization". the FBI ... for "bureau" ... the ICO, for "office" ... the DEA, for "agency" ... ETC. 
In English, the nouns are mostly neutral and the article associated with them, too. 
That's not to say that you translate: The house, like "Lo casa", or "The sea", like "lo mar" ... p.e. 
 
Or what gender word do you mean? 
Maybe there's the secret of "LA GDPR"

@Marce_I_P @Confilegal The RGPD (and data protection laws in general) are provisions that demand results, but rarely establish means. 
The interdisciplinary communication with IT / SI is intrinsic to the compliance of this regulation and must be given according to the treatments.

Excellent news, @MarlonMolina!

@tumbolian @rangel_brenda @UlrichRichterM @googlemexico In fact, since 2003 I have struggled with "technophobia": 
@tumbolian @rangel_brenda @UlrichRichterM @googlemexico Those in this conversation are convinced that this argument is empty and takes the hand of the nineteenth century. 
@rangel_brenda @tumbolian @UlrichRichterM @googlemexico Google is more than just a search engine. 
The above makes it very difficult for Mexico to deal with Google ... and with any other SERVICE PROVIDER OF THE INFORMATION SOCIETY. 
There is still a long way to go in this regulation. 
@tumbolian @rangel_brenda Regarding this, I could not agree more. 
 
And I respect your work a lot, but I think the meaning of that sentence is also being interpreted too extensively. There was no ruling on the Right to Oblivion. 
@tumbolian @rangel_brenda However, the resolution is clear in this regard: 
"Without it being possible in this avenue of amparo the analysis of the right of freedom of expression, which as an interested third party defends the complaining party, because at this time the scope of the amparo is limited to its right of audience" https: // t. co / D1QiNvXxHb 
@tumbolian @rangel_brenda It will be interesting to see the sentence. 
In the case of Fortuna magazine, a violation of the right to a hearing was resolved, but it was sold as something else. 
@rangel_brenda I think that they hope that the sentence of the SCJN does not resolve all the substantive issues, including their responsibility as a MEDIO in cases that could damage the honor, image or privacy.

I'm sorry, but I differ from your criteria, and the reasoning to reach the conclusion 
I recommend reading docs of the GT29 that I mentioned. 
@rangel_brenda @iurisfriki (...) there is a criterion in this regard, which should worry or convince me ... in relation to the digital fingerprint. 
@rangel_brenda @iurisfriki What I am about to defend administratively, it will be easy with D. Compared ... but I am interested to know if really (...) 
@rangel_brenda @iurisfriki And specifically, to know if someone has seen a sentence? in which "argue" why a fingerprint IS a sensitive data. 
@rangel_brenda @iurisfriki For that reasoning, if I can access my bank statement through my voice ... does that biometric data become financial data? 
@rangel_brenda @iurisfriki I do not believe that the type of information that allows me to access a biometric data, or any other, determine its nature. 
@rangel_brenda @iurisfriki Rather, I tend to think like the GT29: 
Not all biometric data processing necessarily includes sensitive data. 
@rangel_brenda @iurisfriki I still do appreciate that the fingerprint, including its image, provide sensitive data and that therefore should be considered as such. 
And in case the footprint only serves as a means of identification for purposes of access control? 
@iurisfriki @Penal_Iuris Did you see this @Penal_Iuris? 
(I think not) 
WP80 and WP193 of the GT29. 
@iurisfriki ¡AND AND AND! 
@rangel_brenda @iurisfriki THANK YOU Brenda! 
What is your opinion about it? 
@iurisfriki CLEAR THAT YES! 
I ALWAYS accept (and ask for help). 
@iurisfriki @Penal_Iuris I see a reinforcement to my position: 
"If a biometric identifies sensitive data  (such as data relating to an employee's health)" 
AND! 
@iurisfriki could help me. 
I am that, unless I provide health information, I do not consider a biometric sensitive data. https://t.co/WsyyhfnwpJ
