@TennisActu She loses she wants to talk about her, that's all. All this for the buzz. Make your life loose cowork a little Caroline.

@francetvsport @OM_Officiel That it turns Mandanda already. Since they became pseudo world champions some Olympians have had melons. A colander the guy. Garcia not the only one responsible.

@Eurosport_EN Every year you cry scandal. All because it is not a French. Modric did not steal his victory. 
@SNCF what interest to put the ticket to 1 euro and you point a delay of 30 minutes every Tuesday without warning? I prefer to pay full price but at least I arrive at the time. Between the blockages GJ and the sncf you make people hate ...

@TennisActu Ouf 
@ThibaultLeRol Dirty day ?? Not nice for Croatia. A very good cup for this team with a perfect cilic and coric. Congratulations to them. 
@WeAreTennisFR Thank you blue for? 
@WeAreTennisFR He did not stay noah ... s ran away to the cloakroom pfff disrespect 
@WeAreTennisFR Ba not make lol 
@MaryPatrux Why is he crying? Serious he feels French right now? WoW is all year dude and especially we live in France we pay what there is to pay 
@francetvsport He did not hold this same speech before the meetings. 
@TennisActu At least he gets to count it's fine 
@WeAreTennisFR As usual 
@WeAreTennisFR Lol not the pre-match speech 
Big mess at island meeting. Airport lock for return to France. Thank you # giletjaune https://t.co/D2jN3FzEAn 
@sludhefner @BFMTV Shame shame. I am on vacation at the meeting currently I am Reunionese I can say that I am ashamed. Those who live not this moment live can not understand the situation. It's not the yellow waistcoat movement, it's the crame scum all. To flee 
@GuillaumeTC So the movement of the vests should not concern the RN ??? They do not suffer taxes? Them? They live not like you inconvenience? Fall back on earth thank you guys. 
@ThibaultLeRol Bravo to the German it is necessary that the public accepts the succession. 
@TennisActu Congratulations to the German !!!! 
@qbooo_ Lol the joke I'm a fan of Indochina but why show trump and not Macron? France angry no? Ah yes no C. The artists are pro Macron it is true I had forgotten ..... 
@TennisActu So thiem loses against Federer and now wakes up against Ni ??? Hmm ..... 
@ThibaultLeRol @beinsports_EN And if not as a commentator why this fixette on federer ?? Anderson also deserves his place ... 
@BenoitMaylin Uh Anderson does not know federer? Is not he the one to give a tennis lesson at Wimbledon this year? 
@julienbenneteau Ouch never say things against Federer. We would forgive him all for this guy. To believe that Federer is tennis. 
@mayer_decathlon @realDonaldTrump Concentrate on your sport or lecture your president (like how he will handle November 17) instead of giving lessons to strangers thanks. 
@ ActuTennis365 Bizarre this match to believe that ... :: 
@ThibaultLeRol @beinsports_FR @ sebboca29 I appreciate BEIN for its broadcasts but too PRO federer for my taste. 
@julienbenneteau You are so saying retired that this year and then it is you who would be available for a place in cup davis no? So why be amazed? Make a buzz? 
@WeAreTennisEN Who gives the names of the groups? Because santoro / Llodra? !!! 
@CombatCombal The difference is that the presenter with spear knows how to sing and even very well. To want to do too much the public will get tired of you. 
@WeAreTennisFR I'm not a fan of both but say that djoko dominates federer uh .... the word is a bit strong. Federer fought very well. Had a winner it was djoko that's all. 
@francetvsport @CaroGarcia D after you? You say nothing positive in your subject. People will not contradict you if? For my part it remains the best French and has done very good result. To her to progress to a happy new year 2019 
@ ActuTennis365 Tanpis but beat sabalenka is not nothing. So congratulations for his match 
@CombineCombal @KarineFerri Whatever one says about combal did well to leave hanouna (troublemaker). It is a very good one. He does not need to tell shit to make the buzz him. Bravo. The Belgian site may have shown these pictures but Hanouna is used to attack TF1. Karine Thought 
@FFTennis @WeAreTennisFR @NoahYannick @jimchardy @ richardgasquet1 @ p2hugz @nmahut @le_pouille @ tsonga7 I do not like it, but not at all the attitude of pair and not a fan of Gilles Simon but we prefer to select Tsonga and cannibal instead uh. .... too much fumette the captain can be ?? Not clear ideas ??? 
@francetvsport After the humiliations she suffered on the doubt that she is a woman here we want to deprive her in 2019. Poor world. 
@ericsalliot Well French that instead of supporting trying to suggest something we belittle. 
@ FranceMarie47 Genre you are beautiful? Should look at home before criticizing and then ask them to be hot to be in government just doing their job. After we criticize men for their lack of fair play tsss 
@TennisActu Not really 
@WeAreTennisFR @TennisTV Highly the season is over for sure it starts to get into the brain. Serious pink! 
@CaroGarcia @WTAEliteTrophy Good tournament 
@WeAreTennisFR He makes a show to jump like a goat on every ball after to give up. The thing is that French journalists are surprised. 
@ jmorel15 @astridbard Even when a sportsman makes a choice of heart we criticize him. You are going very badly people limit embittered with an ounce of jealousy with bullshit. Bravo Morel good luck to you. 
@TennisActu Unfortunately it will not last. One out of 100 burst. Inconstant, however, some talent

@LHallyday Why private Laura and david? Are they the ones who have suffered more? They did not have the chance to grow up with their father so a lack. The very important blood tie very expensive. Try to soften the public by using your daughters for money a shame. 
@WeAreTennisFR @CaroWozniacki So not the 8 best ones. He misses halep 
@ TF1Pro @ACCoudray @MayCarcabal @Stevens_Caro @GrossoSteve @ TF1LeJT @LCI @romainhussenot @acoudenho @monier_eric @xgandon His country was the United States no? Why a title as phony? She just whines TF1 to try to rally the pseudo fan to his cause. For a widow she should have remained discreet. Money fric. And the media that make special pages ... pathetic. 
@RTLFrance Already from which country does it speak? Because if it is France he did not live there much except to sell his albums. So stop with your promo without interest 
@BFMTV Special edition for an album ??? Laughable. Poor France

@WeAreTennisFR @WTA It's not going to last sorry 
@alizecornet Yeah. 
@Eurosport_EN No surprise of the victory of the PSG I do not understand why to make a history of it. They dominate the league 1 it is certain.By against in league of the champions of the small chickens. 
@EmmanuelMacron Well, I confess I was not moved. 
@la_pouille @SH_RolexMasters So French players do not know how to write in French it is such a beautiful language yet. Too bad to be proud 
@WeAreTennisFR Madame Irma now? Serious do you predict the future? Let her go ... it seems to make you happy. 
@CaroGarcia @ChinaOpen @JJlovesTennis You are beautiful besides all the outfits you go (holding your games especially). Go go for your next match 
@ NickFaldo006 @astridbard @RyderCupEurope The meyor 
@TennisActu I do not know who makes the comments at home but say so you are distressing. Crushed. In pain. 
@SebastienAudoux French people love boos. Just watch a tennis Roland garros or Bercy opposite Rafael Nadal. We do not like winners here. Bad reputation in the sports world. 
@jdoreofficiel She has the right not to love. For my part I like both versions. Freedom of speech... 
@IrisMittenaereO @ DALS_TF1 @Anthonycolette_ @ TF1 We are waiting to see on a tango. Because it's good to be sexy ect but dance is not just about that

@DebbouzeJamel TF1's day has become anything ... 
@WeAreTennisEN Malice is a bad thing that makes you bitter and jealousy may choke you. Legend she is legend she will stay :)))) 
@ chrishadley69 @morandiniblog @ZemmourInfos @TPMP She goes to Hanouna. To wonder if it was not a trick. The level was too high. 
@LCI It feels reality TV its story. In short, we talk about it more. She had nothing to do in this kind of show just to complain. 
@ SoulBass2 @simon_orht @BenoitMaylin @ GillesSimon84 @MoselleOpen Compare Simon to Ferrer what an insult to Spanish. Simon a good French player but no glamor has his assets. 
@alizecornet Given the normal antecedents .... 
@TennisActu Not ??? 
@ajplusfrancais But it's quiet ... :: just buzz. 
@benoithamon WoW Hamon ...... same story as Bayrou no interest 
@morandiniblog She should go down again. She uses her color to cry scandal. When one agrees to go into the show of ardisson one has to wait to be exposed. She was never embarrassed to give his opinion there was a time. 
@BenoitMaylin @DavisCup There is only in France that we do a lot for this cup. Ok this is the only time the French can do anything and the French journalists can express themselves but still .. move on, huh! 
@rogerfederer He will just miss Rafael Nadal in this group. Both legends. 
@WeAreTennisFR The 4 potentially but will not last as federer and Nadal at the top level 
@WeAreTennisFR @JeuSetMaths Lol copa davis ok but otherwise Grand Slam master 1000 we see nothing. I understand better why it is the French who complain about the new reform. They have that. 
@DebbouzeJamel @PatheFilms @ Alad2 @kevadamsss @ericetramzy @RamzyOfficiel @VanessaGuide A turnip more we will soon be able to make a salad 
@bayrou Surprised to see you Francis I thought that you were done with politics given your inconstancy in your choices. I tu you huh you are part of the people who voted Macron 
@DebbouzeJamel De com for their movie which is a turnip. 
@FFTennis @WeAreTennisFR @benoitpaire There is only this cup that the French can claim to win something. Not what to do. 
To make medicine to finish in tele medicine. Risible .. #telemedicine 
@BFMTV why nobody talks about the car that wanted to rush into the crowd last night in nimes and that made two wounded. It takes deaths to have any interest? 
@GilbertCollard No newspaper talks about it needs dead to have an interest 
@FFTennis @WeAreTennisFR @benoitpaire Good for this weekend saw pair selection a boycott in court 
@WeAreTennisEN You can not congratulate that judge? A French woman !!!! Hey ho, not often that! France is so bad that we can not appreciate this moment of joy? Crazy that !! And why 'problem'? Wait to see ... change your nationality if you are unable to be happy 
@QuentinMoynet The french lesson lol donor 
@Eurosport_FR The French who give lessons looooool seen the fair play of some of our players we should be silent 
@state2 @francetvsport @arnaudclement @serenawilliams This is a normal guy he will say the opposite. Ask a referee to see his feelings on the issue. Some players did worse .... 
@pmouratoglou The coaching in full match what idea tss she took a warning hop out of her match. She remains a great champion a final is not nothing and congratulations to Osaka. Women's tennis every year changes from winner to us. 
@WeAreTennisFR The referee decided to take Serena tonight. He did not have to digest his stake 
@WeAreTennisFR Genre serena needs coaching during a game looooool uh we are talking about a legend that has won everything mdrrrr. Bartoli, on the other hand, would do better to keep quiet level comment. 
@francetvsport Comment no interest: Nadal has knees ???? You are serious?? We say abandon 
@VamosRafamily It is good that he gives up at the risk of aggravating his injury. He remains the best 
@TennisActu Avoid thanks https://t.co/sgW3kBgpkT 
@AgathePhi @mayer_decathlon @decastar_off Thanks 
@mayer_decathlon @decastar_off What's on which channel to miss this appointment? 
@WeAreTennisFR The legend! 
@benoitpaire @WeAreTennisFR Avoid doing as in the Olympics and avoid shaming France with your head-to-chek behavior. Even if I'm not a fan of Puglia, take an example of his involvement. Thank you! 
@WeAreTennisEN A shame. The image sent to young people: break your racket, disrespect the players to the referees to the public and you will be rewarded you will represent your country France 
@WeAreTennisFR For the shot 'maestro' a little obsolete 
@ moutet99 @ThibaultLeRol Absolutely! 
@KMbappe @PSG_inside @neymarjr The melon. Young and silly. Good image conveyed to young people. Know how to control yourself

@nimesolympique Parisians were hot. To take two goals per se saying a team of peasants in the LDC are caspers despite the Neymar and co. So do not bring her back too much and stay humble. 
@nimesolympique Genre is a feat of fighting? Wait in ldc we will laugh. Tsss 
@fxlvt @nimesolympique Avoid comparing the om to Nîmes thank you. Even less avoids talking about the om 
@TennisActu Genre she never had melon. Always want to make the buzz 
@RafaelNadal just thanks ... a champion 
@lulhizza @rolandgarros @RafaelNadal @karenkhachanov @corinnedubreuil Rafa number one fed number 2 
@ RN3686 @RafaelNadal I also love it pfiouuu heart attack was not far 
@TennisActu Genre Rafael Nadal is the only team in Spain. Do not begrudging them please. There is very good player in this team 
@nimesolympique @ Rips_20 @NzoGraphic @neymarjr @ Ligue1Conforama @ kimpembe_3 @nimes The beating of the century 
@WeAreTennisFR @NickKyrgios It was up to Herbert not to become demotivated. If he lost it is certainly not because of the intervention of the referee. To make a pataquès for so little because it is a French opposite. 
@Eurosport_EN You are not tired of us shame you French player to moan all the time. Hello the image conveyed by French tennis between pairs who .... no word and horn that ... must stop. Fortunately there is Caro to raise the level 
@TennisActu Why look for a tangle? That's not what made the game lose so look no excuse. 
@Eurosport_EN I love this player she drops nothing. Our French Champion 
@alizecornet Mental.....en carton 
@beinsports_FR @fredericviard So we have to stop the @ subscription to bein and take eurosport to see us open. Pity. 
@TennisActu The decisions and the president at the con will not be accepted anymore 
@Eurosport_EN A melon instead of the brain 
@TennisActu He's trying to make the buzz ???? 
@WeAreTennisFR Blabla 
@Andromelus @BFMTV People who criticize reality TV wholesale were the fans but not the ones who do it. The guy ok he did it was his choice you I guess you're unemployed and have to live on allocation so embittered we will complain. The human deserves no death Rip to him. 
@ABourreaud @Lea_Frb @ChrisBoost @ 20Minutes So why are you commenting on this topic ?? Go along your path 
@ regord34 I do not understand yet it is the people who voted for him no? Why complain about it now? You have now sought it and we will be entitled to it again for 3 years 
@WeAreTennisEN You're talking about an ad. Fortunately there are babos to raise the level 
@TennisActu The points do not matter she slips down squarely. She can not play tennis anymore. As long as she keeps this staff will be nothingness. 
@nimesolympique On the other hand the public whistle for what purpose? It was the om anyway. And your celebrations on the ground limit. Even if the om (move you pff) on the ground it remains a big club. Let's wish the Nimes to stay in this dynamic because the maintenance .... 
@ tsonga7 Not to be mean, but I honestly thought you'd stopped tennis. It was so unnoticed your absence. 
@RafaelNadal @usopen @frnadal On a hâte champion 
@nimesolympique @OM_Officiel @canalplus @ Rips_20 @paul_bernardoni @SofianeAlkch For the other matches ok go nimes but sorry but go l om tonight. A fan of always 
@francetvsport Push the beating 
@BenoitMaylin @CincyTennis It's not going to last 
@ThibaultLeRol @beinsports_EN What interest this tweet knowing that we all know that your preference is federer ... the three are legends and we have the chance to live that. So enjoy the beautiful game and stop trying to compare and fall into fanaticism without much interest. 
@BastienGrimal By cons Bastien you should calm the game. Show that you're smarter. Ok you gave your opinion now it is the public who buys these shits to make their judgment. 
@BastienGrimal For what reason exactly? For giving your opinion ??? I do not like the mc do and then the candy stuff stuff foo .. I'm going to have a lawsuit ?? Bastien to kill? Bastien to rape? Bastien to sequester? No, he just revealed that some sheep reality TV was sheep. 
@WeAreTennisEN Good decision. He rested. Federer gave up in Toronto nobody had anything to say 
@TennisActu Bravo Caro 
@TennisActu Why not qualify for mladelovic? 
@BastienGrimal Very virulent the words of some. Bastien you do not need support like this person. You understood that the world of reality was worth nothing apart from becoming even more stupid and the other is making money on the backs of these naïve sheep so much better for her. You live your life 
@WeAreTennisFR Let's be chauvinistic ok but from there to write sharapova is who .... limit. Not that I'm a fan but appreciate his career. Congratulations to Caroline Garcia wishing her to go very far in this tournament. 
@CaroGarcia Bravo thank you for making us live these moments of sport. Mierdou for the rest. You have the game to get there 
@MonsieurDream Already what do minors on YouTube ??? Lack of awareness of parents no? 
@Midilibre Serious ?? Poor soul .... or donkey to choose .. 
@WeAreTennisFR Super to see him again at this level. Rafa and murray in the same tournament beautiful to see 
@BFMTV Racailles 
@ogon_myach @ P33TCH @ Shanks_66_212 @ Viperman666 @MichaelYoun People must have shit in their ears 
@francetvsport The commentator france2: bardet disappointed ... uh be respectful sir. When one is in one's chair it is good to criticize .... 
@TennisActu It aims l us open for the recovery I guess ??? 
@martinfkde @LeTour @francetvsport Better eurosport. Commentators francetv roland garros and Tour de France same fight no flavor and not at all credible 
@alizecornet @WTA_Gstaad Not a lot of competition in front we expect to see grand slam or tournaments of the same scale as Caro but played well 
@KaPliskova Félicitations 
@RafaelNadal @spain What I like most about Spain: your tennis 
@Benzema @Eurosport_EN Bon j appreciate the character but congratulations to him for the congratulations 
@liloukg @NicolasSarkozy @equipedefrance Policies must not be football fans? Sports in general? Where does it come from? Ridiculous if it is to come to deblock on one of these posts buck the thank you and let the real fans appreciated 
@xKoXiZaX @Nadal_Fr C is known he does not appreciate Nadal. 
@WeAreTennisEN A legend 
@jeremiejanot When you are so called a "great sportsman" you respect all sports. The efforts that tennis and individual sport cycling deserve more respect than football with its 90 minutes of time. And we wonder why you did not fizzle in a team of Fra. # Respect 
@la_pouille @WeAreTennisFR Proud to be french .... uh you would not live in dubai? 
@ThibaultLeRol @beinsports_EN It would be nice if the commentators stop congratulating federer at each point while there is a French opposite thank you .. 
@WeAreTennisFR @BenRothenberg Madam Irma suddenly ??? 
@WeAreTennisFR The boss is not Nadal? Number one no? 
@TennisActu As d hab 
@KikiMladenovic @TimeaBabos The doubles tournament ... your real place. A partner can help you with your tennis faults

@WeAreTennisFR @TennisTV He should put on a show what a fun !!! 
@VivDesloges Would you have preferred JUL? Beautiful Marseilles 
@Madame_Clairon Anyway in 2018 people are ready to laugh at anything to make the buzz kind of interesting 
@ThibaultLeRol Someone like you fan of federer will never say the opposite huh ... 
@RafaelNadal @rnadalacademy Thanks to you

@DanielRiolo He's not a usual soccer journalist him? Why does he come to bile on tennis? It is so bad that in football that we want more of him? Let the real pros talk about it please thank you. 
@francetvsport Lol 
@TennisActu If at age 32 we are old ... it sucks 
Roland garos this year very REndo !!! (Broadcasting of France tv limit.) Annoying commentator. 
@francetvsport From there to say that it is null must not exaggerate. It was a non match. In France we are demanding we do not accept. Give it a chance for the moment it is the only French who does something woman confused man in France 
@rolandgarros @Nadal_Fr And no broadcast of course 
@francetvsport And you intend to retransmit the game or not? Or we have to wait for the replay on YouTube? 
 
@francetvsport Oh but it is not possible they do not put the game of Garcia seriously serious you. We're crazy about rugby 
@WeAreTennisFR Casper this guy for a while. The newspaper had sold us as a future .... ba nothing in fact pfff disappointing ... 
@rolandgarros @Simona_Halep @andreapetkovic Definitely the organizers every year you get worse and worse. Parmentier is entitled to the top of the courses and there number 1 the 18 ??? It becomes laughable. No court covered tv programming no commentator no comment. Bravo ... 
@francetvsport lol France 2 you give us the match djoko (so-called live) while it was over for 10 minutes 
@TennisActu Humility right? 
@ ActuTennis365 He did it 
@jeremiejanot True :) 
@francetvsport You complain to see very few spectators for the French games but it is not given to everyone then you want to have the monopoly of the broadcast and you bombard us with ads and we miss the broadcast of the match of Caro Garcia ..abuse no ?? 
@ ActuTennis365 Change staff, stop a moment. Someone tells him that there is a real problem ... 
@francetvsport @ moutet99 Avoid igniting 
@francetvsport @alizecornet @ azzuro185 You're arrogant too 
@unecatef_coachs @jeremiejanot Zizou wears the colors? He is lucky to have a star team so the credit goes to his team. 
@TennisActu @rolandgarros Just missing a roof for the central office. 
@Darkocttg So what? 
@ ActuTennis365 And of course the pseudo journalist will release us that is the future noah ect ect and put the pressure on the shoulders of this player pff 
@NewsTVreal @BastienGrimal It's a pity of your videos. I like Bastien the person this simple side ect but criticized moundir c is to put you at the same level as these pseudo reality TV star (I'm in no way a fan of moundir and co) you have other argument to make you known and be popular 
@KikiMladenovic Lol 
@stade2 @francetvsport @la_pouille @rolandgarros @France2tv Lol

@WeAreTennisFR @eliweinstein What is hope? 
@jejeblt Is it their fault if there is an attack? Do not mix everything when we do not like we do not look 
@WeAreTennisFR He is human so not invincible and still happy. That he is resting for Roland now, thiem a shot from time to time so nothing extra 
@CaroGarcia @MutuaMadridOpen What a pleasure to have such a player in France. Thank you !!!! 
@TennisActu If Maria bcp waste, what is it? She must have a psy concern this girl 
@WeAreTennisFR @ doublefault28 He should concentrate more Monfils instead of doing the guignol 
@RafaelNadal Just bravo

#Eurovision sure pretty but the song not winning. Not terrible 
# Presidential2017not to cry for those who voted macron. Sheep. Small employees we find you in the street. Loi Khomri 
Mr C is in France and not the bled that allowed you to have money so without France you are nothing. But leave now ... ungrateful https://t.co/X6iU7qMDHD 
@EmmanuelMacron people have demonstrated en masse against the law el Khomri (approved by mr macron) and you want as president? Laughable.

I have trouble with the gamin he plays very badly # LaMainduMal 
Very good actor Joey starr 
How much is it? #LaMainduMal 
The bullshit of hanouna is like the current France.

Kevin Mayer amazing 
France 2 prefers to put the Bolt race at the expense of the box with a French lol 
@francetvsport rafa who is satisfied with gold doubles ... C is already not bad right? And especially his 2 nd Olympic gold medal. 
@teddyriner @FranceOlympique you made us vibrate thank you for these great champion moments. Island meeting with you 
Stop the commentators !! https://t.co/qvZPipPPzv 
Jo: we will miss two great champions at these games: muffat and vastine 
Go lucas puille we count on you for the relief because frankly ...... 
A song in French would have been more representative but otherwise good show # ShowEuro2016 
Serious l hyme the ??? # ShowEuro2016 
It would be nice if France 2 put us the game of serena. Very little female match broadcast 
It would be that the game cane / benneau be broadcast instead of that of muray #RolandGarros 
Too bad a lot of match broadcast especially among the ladies #RolandGarros
