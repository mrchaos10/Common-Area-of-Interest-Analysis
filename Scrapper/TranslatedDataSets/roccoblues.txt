Does the person who invented the blister pack already burn in hell or do I still have to wish for it? 
@nLight I hear you. But I don't like the idea of facebook owning the rights to everything I post. Even if it's just crappy photos of flowers.

@nLight development and scan was done by @MeinFilmLab. I downloaded the scans but the negatives will be send back by mail. 
@JohnnyPatience Thanks. Tri-X of course. ☺️ Also got shots of my family that turned out great. Just didn't want to share them online.
