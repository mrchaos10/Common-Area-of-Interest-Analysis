@LEBenshoff I *ask* reporters to do it when they talk to me, in part because I often have to use somewhat technical language. It's incredible reassuring when they do. 
Voters in Michigan focus groups spontaneously mentioned a *2008* state reskilling initiative known as No Worker Left Behind. Eleven years after the fact, still resonating! #SkillsSummit2019 
College is once-and-done; skills training is forever? Voters receptive to idea of regular "refresh" and reskilling opportunities, says @NSCRachelU #SkillsSummit2019 
American voters LOVE the idea that skills training makes America more competitive in the 21st century economy. Across the board support in @SkillsCoalition poll of Rs, Ds, and Independent voters. #SkillsSummit2019 
Another theme that resonated with R, D, and Independent voters in @SkillsCoalition polling: 21st century skills include but are not limited to "traditional" manual/technical skills. (My paraphrase.) #SkillsSummit2019

Onstage at #SkillsSummit2019, I talked about the fact that 41 states have set "postsecondary credential attainment goals" for their state residents. They won't get there with K-12 students alone. We need meaningful pathways for adult learners &amp; workers! 
So glad to hear #SkillsSummit2019 panelists talk about literacy and numeracy needs among American adults. Crucial issue for #AdultEdu advocates and others.

And finally...I couldn't let this children's book thread end without a @CiteBlackWomen moment. Andrea Davis Pinkney's A POEM FOR PETER pays tribute to the classic picture book A Snowy Day. Well worth reading! https://t.co/wvXP0l89tD

And for older kids, FAMILIES by Shelley Rotner and Sheila M. Kelly uses low-key text and real life photos to demonstrate how loving many types of family constellations can be. https://t.co/HZO3GlUMcN 
You're never too young to see a vision of the world that's wildly inclusive. The board book EVERYWHERE BABIES offers a joyful peek at babies of all ethnicities and backgrounds doing what babies do. https://t.co/rDih3fvJM6 
@Ninachenlangen Oooooh, congratulations! How absolutely wonderful for you. I'm so happy to hear it. 
An endearing story of childhood friendship is CHICKEN SUNDAY by Patricia Polacco. This picture book honors Russian-Jewish and African-American cultural heritage of its characters in an unpretentious, authentic way (the story is from Polacco's own life): https://t.co/52zZZhwinZ 
Another winner is IN PLAIN SIGHT by Richard Jackson, illustrated by the legendary Jerry Pinkney. Seriously, you cannot go wrong with Pinkney books. This one is about a young African-American girl and her grandpa. https://t.co/mD1j88NSLJ 
Need a board book that parents can stand to look at 837 times? (You never know which one a child's going to get obsessed with.) ANIMAL TALK features absolutely stunning Mexican folk art. By Cynthia Weill. https://t.co/66eDPbCtYc 
Looking for a board book for the very littlest (0-2) children? 'MORE MORE MORE' SAID THE BABY by Vera Williams is a nice choice - and features White, Black, and Asian characters to boot. https://t.co/oSWvcFZa8a 
If you want to foster an appreciation of our extraordinary planet and its natural beauty, THE OTHER WAY TO LISTEN by Byrd Baylor is the choice for you and your 6-9 year-old. Bonus: intergenerational relationship between an elder and youth. https://t.co/qBGnVbrBKC 
(That last one was by Crockett Johnson, who also illustrated the wonderful THE CARROT SEED, a tale of optimism and stubbornness and persistence and gardening by the redoubtable Ruth Krauss.) https://t.co/eQy2N1VhAt 
OK, back to whimsy. If you have a 4-7 year-old in your life, you should be reading HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON. Ethnically ambiguous titular character (very inclusive!) takes himself on a magical, daring adventure and rescues himself just in time for bed. https://t.co/pRmUP2yKCh 
As long as we're talking about children (and adults) who like slightly gruesome/scary stories, FORTUNATELY by Remy Charlip should definitely be on the list. All kinds of ridiculously narrow escapes from death. https://t.co/WLMozchwEb 
For 4-6 year olds who like small delicate things but have a slightly grisly sense of humor, the four stories in Maurice Sendak's NUTSHELL LIBRARY are perfect. "'I don't care, said Pierre.' So the lion ate Pierre." Don't worry; he's fine. https://t.co/LPsQe7N636 
I think all of us can identify with ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY sometimes. Judith Viorst's story of a grouchy elementary schooler is timeless. https://t.co/0tJJZAtJLW 
There are only 5 words in all of ORANGE PEAR APPLE BEAR, and 4 of them are in the title. And yet the elegantly shaded illustrations and repeated-with-variations text tell a perfectly comprehensible story. I've given this Emily Gravett book many times. 
Know a preschooler who likes to eat? The bouncy rhyming text of BEE BIM BOP by Linda Sue Park is a super fun read, and there is a yummy recipe to boot. Thank you Korean immigrants for this delicious addition to the American menu! https://t.co/pJ3c4VIaQL 
(As a reminder, even though I'm tweeting these as the #BookAunt, they aren't just for children - in my prior job, I often gave children's books as gifts for my interns at graduation or as other thank-yous. Stories are timeless.) 
For luminous bedtime reading, GRANDFATHER TWILIGHT by Barbara Helen Berger is just lovely. Quiet story about the elder who each night chooses a pearl from an "endless strand" and "gently gives it to the silence above the sea," where it becomes the moon. https://t.co/sXsJmSq6qr 
If you want a very accessible introduction to US migration (forced and voluntary), WE CAME TO AMERICA by Faith Ringgold is an understated, developmentally appropriate choice for 3-7 year olds. https://t.co/UqVGP6wtnr 
FREDERICK by Leo Lionni is a gorgeously poetic, gently flowing story of a field mouse who doesn't collect food for the winter. But he does collect imagery -- and his rich word-pictures enliven the cold winter evenings for his friends. https://t.co/pFB6KQMATL
