RT @officielniro: ⏳ https://t.co/1bNp5Y4v4x 
@ Djibril1_ @LeRetourDuFoot Pr me as long as we will not recruit a real player on the right side, the game will lean tjr left, it is the bottom we have our most decisive players ... right Lingard and Mata is helping out it's not their fault 
@ Djibril1_ @LeRetourDuFoot Enough but we are not a team of possession who will go to the game of the camp of the opponent facing a top 6 ... against weaker teams he can afford to bring more front but face to the big it annoys me that he takes care of his defensive role 
@ Djibril1_ @LeRetourDuFoot Yes the game is more to the left but in mm tps it is the low that you have Pogba Martial Sanchez Rashford often ... and Herrera does not forget his passes for Pogba last (the center pr head, the pass that he makes by tackling on the surface) so he goes up too, maybe not 
@ Djibril1_ @LeRetourDuFoot But Herrera must have instructions and then it's Tottenham in front you will not go project yourself every time ... and then sometimes he is higher but you want him to do that for 90 min he not the mm qualities that Paul ... he works well in the middle me it's okay 
@ Djibril1_ @LeRetourDuFoot Exactly that's wrong! This is the component that put on the tv but Herrera is in front of the defense tjr ... Pogba when we have the ball is higher ... Herrera runner right is wrong, he is at the recup with Matic 
@ Djibril1_ @LeRetourDuFoot But it's not Herrera and Pogba higher than Matic huh ... Herrera is in front of the def with Matic ... the one who is allowed to have the most freedom in the middle is Pogba ... already we take the water behind I will not ask him to accompany the actions
