@CalumPeat @HibernianFC @HibsNews1875 Have you ever heard Tyson fury's story about his battle with depression and his daily battle, there is several good videos on YouTube about it, with a listen and will certainly give you inspiration 
@premierleague Yes and liverpool have a game in hand and city have Chelsea, it could be 6 points again in a week 
@xtophercook @LADFLEG Its hilarious her trying to take the moral high ground 
@BBCPolitics @eucopresident Shes just annoyed because there using her wood pellets to heat hell 
@BBCMarkSimpson Is this significant? Hes 50 not 25 hardly a young one 
@Jacob_Rees_Mogg Incase your not sure, he's talking about you #bullshit #bullshitking 
@JoeBrolly1993 It's not right, even a slight tax increase for there massive companies would put millions if not billions more into the Irish Gov pockets, its highlighted now when we cant pay nurses properly, everything has to be done backwards here 
@markdevenport I think it says a lot about you when that's your main focus from this article 
@JoeBrolly1993 Joe, unfortunately at this stage they have embedded themselves into Ireland, its virtually impossible to win this battle due to the amount of jobs they have created, im sure there workers pay tax, it's a catch 22 
@tnewtondunn Sorry, I laughed out loud looking at this 
@RorysStories The basics in life are health care and trying to keep people alive, these people should be priority in society and it's a shame they are being ignored once again, no wonder the nurses go abroad for better pay and working conditions 
@sweetirishf @mattie18rowden @CahillFran @Biscanovic @officialgaa @GaaClare @Armagh_GAA I know for a fact it didn't 
@sweetirishf @mattie18rowden @CahillFran @Biscanovic @officialgaa @GaaClare @Armagh_GAA They did stand, I can see them myself, his eyes are no better than my eyes, you can see it, everyone who was around the goals for the second goal said it didn't cross the line, i cant see it myself because the camera work is poor, the first goal can be seen that its hand passed 
@sweetirishf @mattie18rowden @CahillFran @Biscanovic @officialgaa @GaaClare @Armagh_GAA There is no point arguing about it, it is what it is,no one died lol 
@sweetirishf @mattie18rowden @CahillFran @Biscanovic @officialgaa @GaaClare @Armagh_GAA Ciaran mc geeney said the opposite in his interview 
@mattie18rowden @CahillFran @Biscanovic @officialgaa @GaaClare @Armagh_GAA He was obviously going to try and fist it over the bar otherwise why would he be fisting the ball in that direction, just a poor attempt of a fisted point and it drops under the bar 
@CahillFran @Biscanovic @mattie18rowden @officialgaa @GaaClare @Armagh_GAA Clear fist pass into the net, other than that it's hard to tell if the second one crossed the line, but the fist pass isn't even debatable

@NBAstroFarm @SkepticZone Hi, where do you live? It's pretty remote? 
@RealAronn @DylanGuy44 @AustinLavigne @barstooltweetss @RobbieBarstool The 2 knockdowns are fuck all in the fight, they are 2 moments, they are not knockouts, fury boxed the brakes of wilder all night, it's a boxing match not a knock down match 
@tylerrjoseph It was my birthday yesterday also, thanks for not caring, because I don't care 
@rte @RTEOne @robbiehenshaw @Kelly64kg Didn't realise this show was still on 
Can you tell me where @DominickCruz got his @Kerry_Official  shorts @JOEdotie legend https://t.co/SRCCwZLvzL https://t.co/e61xZLZlPm 
@JOEdotie What a little legend, little warrior 
RT @RTEgaa: On 21 November, 1920, the British army killed 14 people, including three children, at Croke Park during a football game.

RT @NASA: We're returning to the Moon, to stay, and nine American companies will work on developing technologies to get there. They'll bid… 
@ballsdotie Its 1 nil and liverpool aren't playing at all 
@BBCWorld It was taken from thieves, ironic 
@SuzMember Disgusting behaviour, I'd love to beat some manners into him 
@theotriangle @fotoole You need to get away from the British isles and see the world if you think Britain is superior in anyway in all of your subjects listed 
@theotriangle @fotoole D'ya mind me asking what exactly you find so enthralling, so alluring, so captivating, so delightfully spellbinding, so blissfully satisfying about a bland culturless kohlrabi that is the british empire in 2018? 
Please Tell. 
Is it the ordered sense of sheer nothingness? 
@Tim_Mc_Garry @LADFLEG Unicorn 
@BBCPolitics @BBCWorld What do you want her to negotiate? A negotiation consists of 2 different parties and in this case its 27 European member states, she cant pull a rabbit out of her arse, this is the best deal that's available from the eu get that into your thick skulls 
@GElvidge821860 @LBC @mrjamesob Because you don't like hearing the truth 
#fucktylerjoseph https://t.co/ymDwdKJtb1 
@GardaTraffic Breakfast on the go lads 
@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 It would be more in your interests to trade with your neighbour's would it not 
@tylerrjoseph At your service 
@Podgerthefirst @MartinR84979227 @SimonZebo Shite talk 
@Podgerthefirst @SimonZebo Oh ffs theres always one

@CregganDerry @JamieBrysonCPNI This statement was never more true 
@sitrapont @rtenews I think the Brits claimed 50 odd territories at one point, ahh all a shower of cunts if ye ask me 
@sitrapont @rtenews In fairness there is no comparison on how much land the Brits have claimed, literally continents, America, Australia, India, closer to home, Ireland and still in Ireland 
@ABC7NY Its Christmas, not the holiday season 
@RcTWood He needed that knock out like a hole in the head 
@RTEsoccer @rtenews Never heard the likes of it before 
@RTErugby @RTEsport Super coach, owes us nothing but would love to see him stay for many years to come 
@AlexCorbs @USARugby Imagine Ireland had there first team out 
@scudmurphy_ @BBCMarkSimpson Pretty pathetic that you find it pathetic, deadly accurate 
@JoeBrolly1993 @JohnFogartyIrl @ExaminerSport Load of bollax, I'd be more concerned about the dubs using croke park as there home ground rather than Parnell park throughout the whole season, annoys the shit out of me 
@campaignforleo Just turned the sod, be great it you said that after your next meeting with Arlene foster 
@LBC It's a cup cake modelled on Arlene foster's beautiful face 
@rtenews Nose on her like a ski slope 
@kyIiegurl She only spent 10000000 to get herself looking like just but ye I agree 
@RTEsoccer This was a great opportunity to bring a fresh face to the job, altho all of these young men wont have played under mick, we have been there and done that, Brendan Rodgers would have been the man, play a bit of ball and give them some confidence 
@LADFLEG Cutting edge! Another one of there threats ? 
@irish_news He will be parachuting himself down to the dole office 
@RichardbrutonTD Yea your right, screw the balls out of Irish citizens, a country that's mainly a rural population and who's carbon footprint is less than the bronx, its China and the USA who need to make a change.. not a greedy government who are wanting more money from citizens 
@irishnewssport @irish_news Fuck me lol 
@JOEdotie He has to say that 
@GCSIPCKC @sicowburn @LBC @fotoole @mrjamesob All your great hero brexiteers all have plans made for there businesses to move to eu countries thats what is alarming for me 
@JOEdotie https://t.co/A7B3ackIBv 
@BBCSport @BBCMOTD Relief 
@irish_news There like the drunk guy who keeps walking up to the night club door and trying to get, cant take the hint to fuck off its not happening 
@MumfordAndSons In fairness it's way 2 big for most venues, seen it in the 3 arena last week in Dublin, it literally took up half the floor space https://t.co/96b0IeixWj 
@rtepolitics @rtenews @campaignforleo @sinnfein @MaryLouMcDonald $400 plate of food? I'd love to know where Leo and co eat ? Your typical meal out in a fairly standard restaurant in New York is at least $120 
@rtenews Loves the limelite 
@RTEsoccer @RTEsport Giving Martin the road would be progress 
@RTEsoccer @RTEsport They are making backwards progress 
@JOEdotie Complete scumbag 
@LBC @AndrewCastle63 Ok so get rid of her, then what ? Put some nutter like boris Johnson or that awful looking human reese moggy foggy, Brexit is a square peg trying to go through a round hole, there is no good deal, it's a complete mess and no one can do any better 
@LBC @MaajidNawaz I'd love to know what his plan is 
@udippy @irish_news Yawn...... are you still talking 
@udippy @irish_news Enjoy your glue buddy 
@BBCWorld Oh, that's a great, comforts me to know that my pilot isnt off his face 
@ShoreRoad94 @JamieBrysonCPNI Maybe they where talking when they should have been listening, it's a fact that sectarianism is non existent in the republic, still strong in the unionist northern Ireland supporters club tho 
@lisaocarroll Firstly, there was no rugby, secondly, God save the queen is an extremely provocative national anthem for Irish people, not to mention it's the English national anthem. Northern Ireland doesn't even have it's own inclusive national anthem 
@dippy1952 @gwenodine @LBC @mrjamesob You don't like the truth 
@DominicRaab Brexit is a turd, you cant polish a turd, what did you expect 
@JojoLeMo @mkokkinouboege @DominicRaab That's the dumbest comment I have ever read, infact I might be dumber for reading it, 
@dianabolpapi @LADFLEG @DUPleader Your that confused about your identity your confusing me 
@RTEgaa @DubGAAOfficial Well you couldn't have the cash cow on the road more that once a year 
@BBCBreaking The bus is approaching, they are all jumping out of the way before they get run over by the bus! Brexit is a mess, David Cameron did the same, nigel Farage has done the same, he knows it's a shit show and he wants out before the shit hits the fan 
@DavidDavisMP Imprisonment? Yous created this billshit now live with it 
@TreyYingst @benshapiro God help them, how will they survive without any bread. Must feel the same as having your hospitals blown up and aid stopped 
@BBCMOTD @BBCOne @alanshearer @jjenas8 11? I need my cat nap 
@LFC Good to see him in the team, a constant threat 
@CNN That is just simply the dumbest looking, most un practical looking machine ever made, number one, you could chop your fucking leg off, number 2 you could chop someone else's off
