Oh Mike Dean you have done it again https://t.co/M1d9TIKTXn 
@ManUtdMindset If it rains in London today it's my fault 
If Chelsea is beaten still it's my fault 
Try asking FA 
# Achityutd 
@reshmikasingh That's all we ask for, beat for us Chelsea and we beat for you Liverpool #ACityUnited 
@markgoldbridge Not the best actually when Rashford,Martial and Mbampe are still around however he will be close to that 
@utdreport The love between those two is unbelievable 
@FullTimeDEVILS @markogorman06 @GNev2 Hahaha it wasn't simple for me @valencia that way"Neville." 
@utdxtra @markogorman06 There it's #amiracle @iloveutd 
@reshmikasingh Trust me we are going to surprise the world with a very big win 
@reshmikasingh They defended perfectly 
@SkySportsNews May his Soul rest in Peace we shall never forget you #@sala @CardiffCityFC striker 
@HaYtHeMoViC17 @markogorman06 I can see smalling and Bailey as our centre backs today 
@_maffoo We have to stop Liverpool by all means a draw is not enough. 
@ManUtdLadiesFC Come on ladies go and make us proud #foreverutd 
@PL_PoIIs @JayneKennion I think the person who posted this could be having amnesia there is no chance a normal person would compare Robertson to a legend like Evra 
@SarahBireete @asiimireritah @MonicahMbabazi @TumukundeMonica @Mulongo77 @jackie_oloya @TheVoiceConsult @kyomugasho3 @BwoweIvan @AAssimwe @musiimee It's a shame coz Uganda is a Pearl of Africa a country with a lot to attract tourist other than Ladies we hope this generation will end someday 
@SayNoMore33 I don't agree with that and you know it as well , Rash is just improving however I would rather have them both than playing against them 
@AyodejiX2 IBRA official the Lion 
@TheUnitedPage @man_ball7 I would give him career contract " until he retires" 
@Sporf @agomes_47 We still hope for a miracle 
@reshmikasingh That's why I support only Utd my love and passion is only for one team and that is ONLY @ManchesterUnited even at the next world I'm sure I will support utd once a red forever a red #iloveutd

@utdxtra Because Pogba plays for Utd the media wont praise him the way he deserves unlike others midfielders  hated but never ignored 
@ManUtdWomen @laurenjamess22 @Sio_Chamberlain Safe hands @Sio_Chamberlain 
@ManUtd_HQ @the_don_80 Please forward this to his timeline 
@Fellaini This guy deserved a lot of respect than he received he was a true professional above all he loves our club you can just see even after leaving his profile pic is still of a utd shirt good luck Fella once a red always a red thank you for the memories 
@LiamPaulCanning @markogorman06 I'm going for this order Herrera, Pogba and De gea 
@Fellaini @ManUtd Once a red always a red we learned to love you in a difficult way however I wish you the best and good luck 
@Vintage_Utd Then there is Valencia ,he is so underrated he has played for us for ten good years even after being converted to right back remember when he used to play 7 then Rafael 2 it was so interesting so he deserves more respect and credited 
@Vintage_Utd I disagree coz mata is a great character in out dressing room then there is smalling and lukaku you can't just let them go coz you need a big squad to compete in case of injuries you will surely need them 
@reshmikasingh Better than you may think Reshmi 
@reshmikasingh @Fellaini We are utd fans we can't do what  fans of some clubs do Fella did a lot despite of harsh atmosphere by most fans he remained professional and even signed new deal even if he is not loved by fans .He is a fighter if he is leaving we should indeed wish him the best Thank u Fella 
@DillanMUFC I'm totally disappointed however a point is better than a lose coz arsenal won their game 
@redfreddevil @IanWright0 We win against Chelsea and they will give us city 
@ManUtdsUpdate @markogorman06 That is mind game they said the same when they were meeting Liverpool 
@broronnie_etm Amen 
RT @MufcForza: Toreira holds Lingard down but Lingard gets a yellow for protesting? This refs needs a smack as well.

@UnitedPeoplesTV Well said 
Give him the job already 
@ManUtd @MoPlay 1-3utd 
@TheUnitedPage @man_ball7 I would replace Jese with Sanchez if he is available for selection 
@SarahBireete @VictoriaNyeko Amen big time 
@utdxtra @sompoch3303 Then why not to be happy with who we have and stop thinking of commercial staffs for once 
@davidwalsh1956 He deserves a testimonial at least he knows what it means to play for utd even when converted to right back there was no better option than him I can only say thanks to him for the loyalty 
@debrxyne @okameyaw I can see the officials are doing their best to guide Liverpool to the trophy this season what a shame FA should be embarrassed 
@Malachians May be under 23 manager 
@JoshGI97 @ManUtd Young will be in for Dalot 
@FootbalIStuff @sompoch3303 Hahaha please pogba watch this style please 
@ JUANDIEGOCOVA1 @MiMaridoFamOf Antonio Andrade 
@ManUtd @MarcusRashford @JesseLingard That look from LINGZ though 
@Vintage_Utd Mata is a player you can't just let go so I would keep Mata,Young and Ander 
@UnitedStandMUFC Both have different qualities Rash adds pace and speed but can't score that kind of goal that Lukaku scored. 
@talkSPORT @talkSPORTDrive They were not invisible coz they were beaten in some games though not in premier league the guy is right 
@Realisiah1 15. 
@davidwalsh1956 It looks impossible but trust me we are heading to Madrid for champions league final 
@CheshireRed68 @maxmufc7 It was expected 
@DillanMUFC They were winnable yes but the fashion of play wouldn't be the same trust me 
@JonathanShrager My question is why haven't we offered them new deals "Ander and Mata" 
@samuelluckhurst @MarvelManUtd Liverpool blood still running in his veins 
@Realisiah1 Only commentary,replays for first team then live for academy and ladies games

@Jude_Mugabi Dady must obey 
@reshmikasingh I don't know if I should be happy or sad on one hand Liverpool is heading towards the trophy that Hurts a lot and on the other hand we shall be ONLY 3 points behind arsenal if we win our game tomorrow 
@Realisiah1 Including mata 
@MourinhoMindset @markogorman06 Martial coz he brings pace and speed in the team .Great talent 
@davidwalsh1956 Our own 
@broronnie_etm Amen 
@Realisiah1 Yes I would even give him time if we can play like that in every game 
@reshmikasingh What makes me to wonder is how Ole changed our style and attitude of play within 48hrs and yet it took Jose years to change from Van gaal's style 
@ManUtdVines He didn't want Rashford to take it but then he celebrated with much passion after the goal that he even forgot that he never wanted him to take it 
@andrewwhite @ManUtd So you are my utd mate # Andrewkabura @ ug #manchesterutd 
RT @Futbol_PoIIs: Who's better? 
 
 
@manutdonion Ed is to be blamed as well for our down fall Pep gets all players he wants and yet Jose was denied his request at the end he is blamed for everything 
@reshmikasingh It hurts a lot 
@reshmikasingh My heart is still heavy I adored Jose as our manager it's unfortunate that it had to end like that he will be remembered forever in our club  thank you for the memories and good luck https://t.co/Us0KN1bbBb 
@academyreview @_MasonGreenwood @DishonBernard Finally i can take a deep breath 
@academyreview It should end already we can't afford to concede another goal 
RT @academyreview: 79' GOAL 
10 men, no problem 
@_MasonGreenwood wins the ball, heads towards the goal and gets his hattrick GET IN 
4-1 
#FAY… 
@TheManUtdWay Whoever think Valencia is not good enough is not good enough to be a united fan 
@SimplyUtd @markogorman06 At least he has not scored as much own goals compared to Jones 
@reshmikasingh He has scored more own goals than at the opposition side 
@SayNoMore33 Why 5 defenders 
RT @broronnie_etm: Are you ready for the "UGANDA FOR CHRIST CROSSOVER???" 
DON'T be left out, come represent your country in the 2018 - 2019…

That if you put the… 
RT @bestcanton7: If you claim to be a @ManUtd but you want Liverpool to beat us so Jose gets the sack you’re not even a plastic you’re far… 
@markgoldbridge Accept it or not but Pogba needs to improve we all know his quality but he is not doing enough 
@GOtvUganda Is Gotv max at 39000 or 49000 
@reshmikasingh And he should have got at least 3 goals nevertheless it was a good win 
@ManUtd Last week we had all our players fit  6 days later only one center back is fit Jose needs to wake up we all no that he wants more players in January so he should stop playing mind games 
@DillanMUFC 100% agreed 
I vote @mollie_green97 of @ManUtdWomen for #FAWC November POTM 
https://t.co/DmUsnucl76 
@GaryLineker Jose was frustrated it was a must win yet Rashford couldn't use his head it's normal for the manager to react in that way coz his the one to take most potion of blame from you pundits 
@reshmikasingh I too wandered however Jones disproved me 
@Dean_mufc88 It was a different case coz today they were passing the ball very first the only problem was a goal scorer 
@ManUtd Why should you start Jones yet you have Bailey, I believe Jose wants to prove that he has the worst defense 
@Vintage_Utd Imitating a Liverpool "Legend" Suarez 
@FullTimeDEVILS Give him a challenge and he will deliver if he starts trust me a goal will come 
@ntvuganda This thing of gender equality is just words yes there things which both can do though not everything so where do they get the word equality from 
@TahithC Have faith and determination  then God will do the rest .Quick recovery 
@UnitedPeoplesTV @ConorMcGrace The only achievement we can remember Moyes for once again thank you for the pair @Moyes 
@ESMEPIMENTEL @modarforma Sarah Granados 
@JoelSsenyonyi We hope these will end someday 
@TheCr7League No way that is your view as well with the love he's being given the little he can do is to not celebrate our loss even the first game after the whistle he was delighted  with our loss 
@IanBarr73 He is one of those who contributed to Van Gaal's failure sometimes players need advice not critics to improve he should learn from Rio 
@Rooney_esque Ibrahimovic spent a short time in our club but I would choose him over Ronaldo since he left our club he has not spoken even a single ill word against the club 
@reshmikasingh Waking up this morning with a nice feeling after that win I said it would be hard but not impossible  when will people understand that you can't celebrate a win against utd until the last second 
@HQManUtd @markogorman06 Trust me I'm not laughing 
@ManUtdLadiesFC @AlexGreenwood History makers 
@ManUtdInPidgin @sompoch3303 Good replacement for Giggs 
@ADDICTED2ManUtd @PhilHowarth Deserves a new deal 
@reshmikasingh The only way to stop the ones ahead of you is by beating them it's a nice weekend already now we need to win both our next two games it's hard I know but not impossible 
@reshmikasingh It was a tough one especially in first  half they were lucky not to concede many in the last 45mins,we are happy with 3 important points however we need to improve on our defense and midfielders  have to start moving the ball faster than we are doing 
@ManUtd @vlindelof @AnthonyMartial @paulpogba Martial 
@sportbible @markogorman06 @Dipak__Gohil May the souls of the departed ones rest in peace 
@reshmikasingh It was a fair game especially that finish by Tony Martial  I have been reading a lot about Ronaldo this Ronaldo that, wait a moment that goal by Martial was more composed finish but because he plays for utd we won't see it on head lines 
@ManUtd Drop Lukaku once and for all other players deserve a chance too 
@OSlickzz @reshmikasingh When someone tells you that you can't do it you tell them just watch me do it. I trust in our team and manager many thought we were going to be blown out by Chelsea at the end they needed 6 extra mins to match us 
@Rashmiksingh 3: 1 discard 
@reshmikasingh Possible debut especially if we are winning 
@utdxtra @markogorman06 That's what I think too there is a possibility 
@SkySportsPL Free kick by Mata 
@manutdirishreds Sorry. May her soul rest in peace I hope we can win tomorrow so that we can dedicated it to her 
@nathan_jackz No way Nathan nothing is greater than Dignity we are utd and our reputation is more important than their money 
@utdxtra It's so shameful 
@MrBryanDavies It's like bringing Moyes back no way 
@GOtvUganda @PearlMagicTV It should have been in plus subscribers not max 
@ManUtdLadiesFC Congratulation ladies 
@UnitedStandMUFC It's not easy to make all players happy even Bale wanted to leave Madrid coz of Zedane 
@MrBryanDavies Dave,Shaw,Smalling,Andres,Mata,Herrera and Martial I know many would want smalling out but he is the only defender we have who is always fit 
@RedDevilBible Shaw deserves more than that 
@RealTalkMUFC Especially at home however we need at least 3 players in January no club needs that market more than us 
@ManUtd Our duty is to support our manager we hope the rumours aren't true in Jose we trust 
@utdxtra @GNev2 It would surely be shameful well said aGNev2 
@ManUtd Martial 
@reshmikasingh We hope for the best I still trust in our manager 
@reshmikasingh Trust me Jose adores our club he showed both frustration and Passion today believe me if the boys can play like they did in second half things will surely turn around 
@markgoldbridge I thought mark was a reasonable person but after reading this I lost respect for him I know it's tough to be a utd fan at the moment but we have to be strong,support our team and hope for improvement not criticising and wishing the team to loose so that a manager may sucked 
@utdxtra Lukaku needs a rest 
@GOtvUganda @PearlMagicTV You should have put it in Gotv plus for the start not max 
@reshmikasingh We need our players to be at their best so good luck to the boys 
@KellyFosters Oh Kell 
@reshmikasingh We surely need another striker in January 
@Vintage_Utd Do you think whatever Pogba has been saying on media is good for a team as a leader? Stop blaming the manager or shut up because the club is bigger than every player let him go if he wants his not better than Becks,Rinaldo,Rud and many more 
@TheUnitedLink What do you want the manager to do when players are not fighting for the badge you can't blame the manager for the past loses 
@Memphis @ChampionsLeague @UnderArmour Once a red always a red please come back home some day #iloveutd 
@ManUtd It's a tough one but I would go with either Pogba or martial 
@reshmikasingh I hope he can return home some day he still loves the club 
@ManUtd We all know how good the boy is so should we call you Rashford Fc too? Especially when he does not perform .This should stop they are all our players and we need to support them unconditionally 
@ManUtd Can we see the first hat-trick after soo long good luck to the team 
@ManUtd Wow wow wow Fred,Pogba,Martial, Rashford and Lukaku all are starting if they can find the balance then this attacking line can be unstoppable 
@JayneKennion Just like seeing Liverpool being scored 
@CanadianRom Come on be patient and wait until salah makes an error then you score so that Liverpool fans can blame Ramos once more 
@FutbolLew @CanadianRom Pogba-keita hahaha what a joke pogba is class apart man 
@dcunited @markogorman06 @WayneRooney After watching Ibrahimovic's goal, Rooney said wait a minute I'm a legend too what a lion can do I too can make it. What a finish from our legend once a red always a red #iloveutd 
@ntvuganda May be criminals just use moto bikes to accomplish their missions when in actual sense thy aren't bodaboda 
@rioferdy5 @RomeluLukaku9 @ManUtd I have never seen  Ferdinand crisis our team even if we are down true Legend you will always be in our heart 
@UnitedStandMUFC If you were a utd coach would you play Rashford a head of Lukaku? we should thank Jose at least for giving him chances even though it's out of position remember when Lukaku wasn't feet and he "Rash" was playing as a striker against Chelsea many fans wanted him substituted 
@ntvuganda @UmemeLtd No way UMEME should stop deceiving Ugandans does it affect only citizens and  not exported power there could be a motive behind that power blackout 
@utdxtra @danmay10 He is a strong guy who loves the club that's why he is loved by fans, he doesn't complain when benched and criticised rather he keeps on fighting for his number he should be example to other players like Pogba 
@UnitedStandMUFC Would you bench Lukaku or Sanchez for Rashford? 
@Devils_Latest @sompoch3303 Oh he would kick pogba for using his mouth always other than legs and brain 
@newvisionwire They are hypocrite after they failed to do justice now they have guts to show up there always giving Ugandans empty promises and violating our constitutional laws by arresting and torturing innocent people 
@ManUtdMEN Not just because of his comment but his attitude too we can't keep a player whose heart desires somewhere else and can't fight for our budge it's better to sale him and sign Milunkovic Savic as his replacement. 
@StatmanDave Bring him back already 
@MailSport @markogorman06 Good luck mate you will forever be remembered in a utd history 
@DeadlineDayLive @Sage02927451 Only a player who is lazy would loose confidence over a demanding coach we know all this craps are created by anti Jose media group 
@ThreeIreland @markogorman06 @FAIreland Good luck and welcome back 
@iamvictor__ @Geddy7777 Oh no what a research 
@Saucemeister01 That's too much bro however this guy is not a utd fan I'm glad that Jose has shut him up I was getting fed up too 
@MENnewsdesk @1965Wendy You can not believe that if only she could trust in the greatest physician the one above all doctors which is God even at the last day she can get another chance  faith and trust are the only requirements needed then the rest will be his part trust me God is awesome 
This can't be a red card for Rashford  there could be some fellows ,officials in FA inclusive plotting against our team as the saying goes it's easy to be number one but difficult to stay number one #iloveutd we are utd therefore we shall fight to prove our worth  to all haters https://t.co/eYqfvcRlij 
@HQManUtd @markogorman06 How did rashford get a red card for that he went to confront the guy ,he wasn't the first to head Burt he ends up with a red card and the real culprit gets a yellow that shows how much people wanted us to loose another game but sorry for them we are utd 
@reshmikasingh @ManUtd In our last two matches we showed quality,attacking football and speed not packing the bus as before 
@reshmikasingh @ManUtd I believe our style of play has greatly changed despite of our resent results 
@utdxtra @markogorman06 @mufcaways_ Non of that will be written and said by double standard media guys 
@ManUtd Pairing smalling and Iceman is another night mare for us .I believe that if they consider performance wise then he should have dropped Jesse other than Fred and Iceman for Bailey 
@MrStephenHowson @markogorman06 Rashford needs to prove that he is capable of leading us yes we know he is a great talent but he needs to be consistent and stop being too selfish however I would not drop pogba for him 
@famousalexnield Big up bro next time better we are utd together we shall overcome the present challenges #iloveutd 
@5liveSport @PV1350 It's a shame that a fan would be happy when his team loose just because they don't like a manager I still believe in Jose therefore plastic fans must either go out on loan or be ready to dream coz Jose is here to stay 
@PV1350 I think your critics of Jose has turned to obsession, personal and baseless our job is to support our manager and players hoping for the best 
@newboy1799 Birthday  boy 
@ntvuganda He is a great disgrace for Tororo time will come when the hunters will be hunted for now we pray for the recovery of Zaake and others 
@ManUtd @LukeShaw23 What are we waiting for to give him anew contract 
@PV1350 It's one thing to play for spurs and another for utd at utd you are watched by many and Criticised by millions which will surely put you under more pressure unless you are mentally strong and that's the difference 
@utdxtra @danmay10 Well said big Sam 
@Pa_Ward1 @manutdirishreds Oh man Fred played very well it was only him and shaw who played to the standard 
@nathan_jackz Our problem was striking line and central defense Jose wanted a backup for Lukaku and central defender however the board neglected his request now they should not blame him remember Lukaku is the only proven striker we have if he fails or gets injured there is no one to cover up 
@nathan_jackz He did his best today he is not to be blamed 
@PV1350 Why should he send Jose out when he is the one to be blamed 
@utdreport It's because he did his best but players couldn't take up their responsibilities apart from Shaw and Fred 
@reshmikasingh We played a good game with poor goal scorers if you play an attacking game you need to score goals knowing that you will concede too Lukaku and Jese didn't do their job well that's my analysis 
@SirAlexWay @iamscholes He was the best cb in the game but shaw was the best player in the pitch 
@reshmikasingh Jose should stop gambling you can't bench a player like Bailey just because of one game it could affect his confidence however I'm behind the team and I hope for the best 
@iamscholes Jose should stop gambling this is a must win game however I'm behind the team though playing smalling,matic and Jones in a back 3 is a real gamble 
@rioferdy5 @ManUtd It was a very long week indeed

@GamboIbraheem @EdWoodwardCEO Oh my friend you are too much 
@EdWoodwardCEO @manutdirishreds We are the richest club for God's sake why can't we spend money on quality players other than looking for barter trade 
@ManUtdChannel @sompoch3303 Still director of football without backing of the board is useless 
@brfootball @CanadianRom @HLNinEngeland How can you sale him for 35m and buy unproven replacement for 71m 
@ManUtdAction @sompoch3303 Is that even possible 
@manutdirishreds We have to know that media is playing mind games with us come to think of it pogba wants a return to Juve at the same time he wants to join Barca these guys want to destabilize our squad from De gea to martial and now pogba 
@manutdirishreds This is a media game and business we can't believe whatever we read ask your self why it's only utd players it's simple the want to sale their papers and without utd on it you can't do business 
@Vintage_Utd @sompoch3303 Fella is not as important as martial that's why he is more disappointed of him than fella 
@sannithmufc @sompoch3303 Even Sanchez is better than Hazard so shut up pogba is not for sale would you give us hazard if we offered you Darmian ,Fellaini and 70m? 
@iamscholes I hope Woodward and the board are watching it too. Fans are frustrated ,they should understand that a club can't stand without fans therefore quality players and entertaining football is a must this season 
@iamscholes Remember there's no pogba,lukaku,matic,Jese,martial and young these are all first team players 
@ManUtd @FCBayern We fans out of UK and Ireland are disappointed  that we cant watch the game 
@ManUtdMEN @sompoch3303 Martial needs time to be stable both physically and mentally a lot has been said about him and Jose that's what makes you to be a united player media does these things always to destabilize either our managers or players and it's up to you either to fight or runaway like a coward 
@FullTimeDEVILS He surely deserves a chance why send him on loan a gain 
@TheManUtdWay @FitzroyWillia16 It can't be a joke because he has to respect the club. He should have gone and return early since most first team players were not around remember Jose's daughter was graduating the day our team was traveling to us but he traveled with the team rather than joining his daughter 
@FullTimeDEVILS @sompoch3303 Jose won't surely want to loose though it's just a friendly and we don't have our star players a draw would work 
@utdacademy_ Northampton were a better side they deserved a win good luck to the boys next time better 
@Michaelfigueir3 @DeadlineDayLive Rojo is better than Jones so it would be fair to trade with Jones instead 
@ClaireKilner89 It's better for those fans to go out on loan if they can't support a team at a tough time #iloveutd 
@MerlinUnited @1965Wendy That is the spirit mate I don't like negativity around our fan base remember we are the richest club and other clubs do want to overcharge us whenever we approach them of cause we can't just give them much money because they want 
@utdxtra @manutdirishreds There is unnecessary negativity in our fan base it's our duty to support our manager and players no matter the situation but what I have observed for the past months we are slowly becoming like Liverpool fans 
@nathan_jackz He accepted to play in any position we have seen most players being converted from left back to wingers and midfielder to defender so that shouldn't be a problem 
@SSIIIIUUUU @sompoch3303 Would you enjoy watching youths without trophies? 
@nathan_jackz @SayNoMore33 If martial keeps on doing what we all know he is capable of until the attacking trio returns I believe he will keep his place. We should be happy that Woodward does not want to sale him or else we shall regret just like we did with Pogba 
@nathan_jackz @SayNoMore33 Nathan why do you hate martial so much 
@GaryMorrissey1 @nathan_jackz He is a natural number 7  very first,talented and has an eye for goal 
@ManUtd @AnthonyMartial That was close indeed 
@sampilger @sompoch3303 We can't blame Jose because it's the work of Woodward and the board to sign players that the manager needs 
https://t.co/I0ZS5mR9X4 
@manutdirishreds I would still give shaw a chance 
@Fred08oficial @ManUtd Welcome to utd family Fred the Red once a red always a red great club,great fans always hated but never ignored #ilovemanchesterunited 
@Devils_Latest Oh these guys once a red always a red https://t.co/dRgl1stdAj 
@famousalexnield @MarcusRashford He should start Rashford in the next game 
@famousalexnield @MarcusRashford Sure 
@ntvuganda First you reported 3 trucks yesterday and now 2 so which one should we take 
@reshmikasingh Check in youtube it was during Van Gaal's reign he said a lot that can offend every united fan that got a chance to watch it, to say that if he was to come to utd he would be the one to teach Rooney so we should go for mane of southampton instead 
@MrBryanDavies He's not De gea we all know ,he is not stable at all 
@MrBryanDavies @ManUtd Thank you for the follow 
RT @MrBryanDavies: If your a @Manutd fan and you are interested in connecting with more #mufc fans, RT this and follow all that RT's. 
 
@ntvuganda Why do you still have debt when you are taxing us for everything you guy think everyone is rich like you ,you tax to increase your salaries other than paying debts 
@venus_0712 The most talented and my favourite for the moment 
@manutdirishreds @ManUtd Then they should lower the price for sandro too 
@Rxglsta @Rio_F79 Hahaha it's time to swallow your words mate 
@TalkUnitedTalk @markogorman06 United MUST do everything in their powers to sign him money should not be a problem 
@UtdHQ_ @markogorman06 The best goal against a top team 
@fionamay4471 @markogorman06 An injury prone player no way no player is worth that money let alone an injury prone Bale may be they want a full fee to pay for Neyma 
@Carabao_Cup @markogorman06 @premierleague This competition is becoming meaningless 
Always hated but never ignored 
@UnitedPeoplesTV It was a beauty Navas had no chance 
@nathan_jackz Nathan martial is not given enough playing time but he is a very good player almost the most talented in our club at the moment they can't bench him that much and at the same time expect a lot from him 
@BarcaRaw @markogorman06 What's  the difference between that and  rashfords goal against liverpool 
@ManUtdChannel @markogorman06 Where is Ibrahimovic? 
@ManUtdMEN @markogorman06 We should not sale martial 
@DiegoMSport @markogorman06 Let him leave already 
RT @ManUtd: Retweet to cast your vote for Sergio Romero as today's #MUFC Man of the Match. https://t.co/Y6gjjvHVE9 
@nathan_jackz It was one of our worse performances of the season first of all Rashford is to take part of the blame he should have passed the ball for his colleague but no he couldn't do that because he is mean and premature he thinks of himself not a team secondly our midfield was too sloppy 
@ManUtd @ericbailly24 That's nonsense you can't risk losing important games by dropping your best defender because you want smalling and Jones to be in world cup 
@famousalexnield @D_DeGea Well deserved 
@ManUtd Player of the year David, pp of the year lukaku , goal of the season Valencia ,young player of the year chong but reserve player i cant choose 
@utdxtra @markogorman06 This man is something else did you see that smile after saying not important 
@SimplyUtd @markogorman06 19 Out of a possible 30 it's not a bad one #Iloveutd 
@ManUtd @RomeluLukaku9 @vlindelof @Alexis_Sanchez If we can utilise this chance i believe we can score more more than 6 goals coz wenger has brought brought in a much weaker team today 
RT @FutboIGuy: Rt if this man hasn’t scored against your club https://t.co/nqkoV5OzuB 
@UnitedStandMUFC Former Dotmond  coach is to take over 
@bigbadredjohn @markogorman06 Dave saves is supper human 
@etmchurch1 Amen 
@ManUtd We need some explanation why Bailey is not in the square this is a big game 
@beast_bailly @RomeluLukaku9 @TheBusbyBabes_ @Pogba6_Lukaku9 @ManGirlsUtd @UnitedGoals__ @LucyyyLouuu95 @TraffordVoice @utds_updates Why are you guys not including persie and Ibra 
https://t.co/2v7QQCOuoO 
@etmchurch1 Amen may his name be praised 
@etmchurch1 Amen 
@AnthonyMartial It was a good one we are happy you were back in the team please sign a new contract we can't stand thinking of loosing you pliz 
@ManUtd @paulpogba I think martial and Jones had to be there competing for man of the match 
@ManUtd This team is capable of scoring more than 3 goals though i'm not sure of clean sheet due to that defence with Smalling,Jones and Darmian  however am happy to see that front 3 and shaw too #gloryglorymanutd 
@TheUnitedPage @KellyFosters @ManUtd @ManUtdChannel @Pogba6_Lukaku9 @MUFCScoop @paulpogba @premierleague 4-0 united 
@ManUtd Strong squad though i can't understand why Bailey is missing 
@ Kumatsia1 @ markogorman06 Hahaha #Iloveunited 
@AcademyManUtd @markogorman06 @NishanBurkart Then there is #greenwood scoring 16 and assisting 6=22 
@youngy18 Great work by the lads i like the way Ramazani  plays his movements are similar to that of Sanchez and that 2nd goal by Ethan wow it was a beauty #l love utd from uganda 
@ManUtd That was a beauty by Ethan 
@famousalexnield Important goal by Boonen 
@ManUtdInPidgin NO! 
 
Game of the season? 
RT @ManUtd: Retweet to vote for @PaulPogba as your #MUFC Man of the Match. #MCIMUN https://t.co/mWjhdvKr5g 
@ManUtd @RomeluLukaku9 @premierleague The happiest part is that Liverpool has dropped some points it's an advantage to us there will be no pressure on our players now we need to play well and beat man city 
RT @MrBryanDavies: Will Lukaku score today? RT if you think he will. https://t.co/pv6mMY8AjY 
@90sfootball De gea can do even better 
RT @GloriousGomes_: Who is the better defender? 
RT - Bailly 
Like - Van Dijk https://t.co/OQDwnPKDDA 
@famousalexnield @Ibra_official @OscarsPop Alex,I miss zlatan already what a beauty from the Lion 
#zLAtan 
#LAvLAFC https://t.co/xyk78K6xSr 
I can't believe it, but why did we let him go #MUFC 
@ManUtd May the peace of our Lord Jesus rest upon us all  in His Mighty name I pray Amen 
@Memphis Oh Memphis come back home to Manchester utd 
@Realisiah1 If it was to keep two I would go with Herrera and shaw but to keep one it's tough to chose between them however I would take shaw 
we love you even here in Uganda Africa 
@ManUtd @Ibra_official So sad I loved IBRA soo much 
#manchester utd diehard fan all the way from Uganda Africa 
@_DavidLeRoy_ @SimonCowie11 @tubby0712 @ManUtd @FA You are wrong man Moyes bought mata at 38 millions and fella at 27 totalling to 65m 
@ManUtd @TahithC I hope the manager can give him a chance next season he is a tricky and talented young right winger and the only promising one at the moment 
@theDB7 @juanmata8 @famousalexnield He is absolutely a fantastic person I hope he could finish his career from utd 
@ManUtd Rest in peace 
@juanmata8 @ManUtd Please sign a new contract our dear special Juan the creative king 
@DeadlineDayLive Sanchez you made a right choice utd is a real Manchester
