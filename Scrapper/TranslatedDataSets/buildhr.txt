@prakashsharma17 @indian_2030 @ShamsuddinRaj @shailendra13121 @IndianExpress Wha bjp wha. Apka statement ache din match Kiya. BJP family dynasty nahi hai. Others are. 19 party presidents wha BJP wha. Love jihad for others but not within your party. Corruption at party president level. 5 years richest party in the world. Wha bai wha. 
@prakashsharma17 @ShamsuddinRaj @indian_2030 @shailendra13121 @IndianExpress If the shadow party wins it is Democratic Party and if others win it is dynasty party. Let’s do random check. Where is Rajnath’s son, where is Goyal’s father, where is Murali manohar Joshi son in law? Has even one coward lost his life for the nation, Apart from writing apologies 
@prakashsharma17 @ShamsuddinRaj @indian_2030 @shailendra13121 @IndianExpress The arrogance and over confidence is flowing down to the last cow on the road. Remember MP, Rajasthan and Chattisghar. The courts have time and again slapped your party including the CBI goofup in WB. Any way keep cheering the 3 idiots Shah- Modi - Adithyanath. Let democracy win. 
@prakashsharma17 @ShamsuddinRaj @indian_2030 @shailendra13121 @IndianExpress Jay Shah? Ambani? Adhani? All in the name of Modi? Alliance in Bihar? Alliance in J&amp;K? Alliances in NE? All indecent proposal and sleeping with an enemy will not last. 
@indian_2030 @ShamsuddinRaj @shailendra13121 @prakashsharma17 @IndianExpress In Gujarat who formed Govt? 
@indian_2030 @shailendra13121 @prakashsharma17 @IndianExpress So you got the answer? Apply your answer to Andhra, Goa, NE. It is not enough if questions are asked. 
@IndiaToday A guy who never went to school, is awarded as a topper by a failed minister. What a pity. Topper in what lies, jumla, Tuglukism, drama, abuse, acting, keeping mum on national issues? 
@IndiaToday Arun Jaitley you lost the elections and was thrown out of Defency ministry and now out of finance ministry now a minister with no portfolio. Now tell us who is a failed minister, politician? No wonder you hate congress party. Don’t worry you will never win an election 
@CNNnews18 And where is the India CM? 
@TimesNow Even more reason to save democracy from this power hunger BJP. Yeddi looks like will breadth his last only after snatching power in karnataka. Look at the audacity with which they behave openly purchasing MLA’s. 
@ndtv How is the josh Mr PM? All the money to purchase the government has it gone waste? 
@IndianExpress There is going to be more stand up comedy in the next 4 months from this Joker. 
@EconomicTimes This is what is called flogging the dead horse. When will you realise that you are the PM and not a comedian of the parliament. 
@IndiaToday @manogyaloiwal “How is the josh”Mr PM. There is a value proposition which money cannot buy. All money has gone waste in NE looks like. 
@ndtv Grow up man grow up. Tea and Pakoda is the level of discussion the PM of this nation can have. What a pity. 
@the_hindu Yes Yedi is honest and not power hungry. He sat for 1 day as CM and got thrown out because all others are dishonest and power thirsty. He is dumb and how can the audio be true. 
@IndiaToday Is this the news you cover? Are your journalistic skills so pathetic. Why don’t you report the same way on how far did Smiriti Irani sit from Modi in party meetings and how close did she sit in private? Third rated journalists fit for prostitution of profession. 
@ndtv How much were you paid this time old man 
@IndianExpress Is BJP not the middleman of power hungry RSS. Is the narrative constantly being changed from incompetence and lies to accusing, insulting and bullying of one family. What will this broker party do if Rahul was not the PM candidate? 
@rohini_sgh Let the list of paid journalist be awarded for prostitution of their profession and all print and TV media cover them with their journey in journalism. A Chai with Pakoda book on them should be released. 
@IndianExpress This Pakoda method of seeing growth and employment only reflects where the nation is being lead too. Be honest and analyse the index of India post 2014. There is divide, uneasiness in the society, fear, main stream is suffering and perception wise a few are evidently benefiting 
@IndiaToday @sardesairajdeep While it is evident Anil Ambani got the benefit of Rafale over HAL, can Modi stop the wild lie that there might be a benefit for someone if congress dealt with Rafale. Does this not sound very school boy type of rhetoric. 
@TimesNow The coming elections will be Pakoda ideology vs the rest. Let the public decide what is required. We are seeing for the 5 years how shallow thinking and justify the decision is done. If India is sustained inspite of this than what all the nation could do. Let democracy prevail 
@moneycontrolcom @nitin_gadkari has your party in its entire 5 year stint ever talked about performance? We listen to only Gandhi family bashing and low level comments from all. Honestly why don’t you advice your party to atleast now talk sometime which will have credibility. 
@htTweets @myogiadityanath This is an order from the CM of India. 
@IndiaToday @sardesairajdeep BJP sent the CBI to arrest the police chief. Mamata literally latti charged the CBI. The SC has to time and again tell BJP that the institutions are  not at the beck and call of the party for misuse. No arrests and if required enquire. Now who won BJP or TMC? 
@htTweets @INCIndia @RahulGandhi @HT_Ed @naqshzeb You are wrong. People like Biplab, Adithyanath, Sakshi maharaja, Smithi Irani feed their master with ultimate wisdom. 
@IndiaToday @sambitswaraj Are you telling the nation that only Modi is honest and all others are lying? History will remember Modi as the only PM to keep on Lying his entire 5 year term. 
@EconomicTimes Where are all the anti corruption, I am for Anna, all those who wanted to clean India? Don’t you paid guys feel guilty for having abandoned this man called Anna Hazare? Even the BJP is not on the stage. He has become a toilet paper. Use and throw 
@firstpost Sorry the CBI is busy in WB and will not be able to attend to this case. 
@IndiaToday @derekobrienmp Budget 2019 bluff was caught by the public immediately CBI went to arrest the WB police chief with no court order and when Mamata latti charged the 40 CBI officials and chased them to the court the Mallya extradition won by CBI is announced. Are we to believe all this. 
@Sindinda My India is great 
@IndiaToday This is another 15 lakh in bank account jumla. Any way BJP has proved all people can be fooled at all times. 
@ShekharGupta @remyanair4 Even if this current Govt comes back to power and do not honour any of these announcements in the budget not a single person will question them. Did they ask for the 15 lakhs, did they ask for 2 cr jobs, did they ask for arrest of any of the corruption allegations. That is NaMo 
@sardesairajdeep This is called bakth behaviour. 
@INCIndia I think you guys have really grown since 2014. The IT cell of BJP must be having a huge attrition 
@Naditya Thorong: This? 
@ANI Only you are correct and all others are ignorant. May be they are anti Indians and need to be sent to Pak? 
@TabbuRao @dineshgrao Is this serial offender any worth. People should throw eggs and tomatoes on him when ever he is in public. We don’t think you should even reply to such perverts. 
@sardesairajdeep Why don’t the media get him on show and drill him. People like Karan should ensure this serial offender wanted in the courts of democracy be stripped and made to run out of the studio. Since no one is confronting him he seems to be ranting uncontrollable. 
@kiranshaw @TabbuRao @dineshgrao Is this street fighter worth a reply. It is better such ill mannered cheepos are ignored and isolated from civilians. 
@bsindia And this guy confirms all people can be fooled all time. Congratulations and best wishes to take the nation back by atleast 50 years. 
@ANI Has BJP taken film production as their alternate income apart from commission from AA? Does it not look cheap to do this cinema stunt. Have you forgotten that you are the minister? 
@IndiaToday BJP has still not realised that congress is a 100 year old party and it can play dirty if situation requires. Idiots make a low level statement on women and if payed back in the same coin they develop cold feet. 
@IndianExpress First sole the cow problem in UP. 
@IndiaToday BJP won the perception battle in 2014 and the same BJP will lose the perception battle in 2019. While both the perception might not be true. Punishment is when it is not expected. 
@IndiaToday @sambitswaraj Comedian in action. He should be voted for his stand up comedy. What a nonsense this Some shit  Patra is. 
@ANINewsUP @ANI Have you recollected what is your date of birth? 
@TimesNow As if BJP gave from its party funds to TMC. 
@ShekharGupta @rwac48 Is it right for the government to reduce the brave efforts of the army to a political party propaganda cinema. Is this the first step towards using the defence of the nation for cheap publicity of one person? 
@IndiaToday Isolated Modi vs united county? What a master stroke. Within 5 years he has successfully got the opposition together and even got Mayawati and Akhilesh together. Good going. Wha Modi Wha. 
@dhume @bhupendrachaube But for defence ministry of the nation job she is doing other things with a lot of stretch. For a minute see where Rajnath Singh’s son is. And similar sons of the BJP nethas. 
@IndianExpress Lunatic in action. His life is going to be spent fearing Pappu. 
@INCIndia @AnandSharmaINC No wonder he goes down the history to be the most trolled Prime Minister. He beats even Trump at the world level. The more he talks inappropriate the more abuses he is going to receive. 
@pbhushan1 @smitaprakash @BJP4India She is fighting for a ring side seat along with the early start side kicks of BJP. Looks like she will out beat Rowdy Arnab, sold out Navika and mouthful Rahul Shivshankar. 
@swarup58 Rai has done so much damage that the history of the nation is completely reversed. One 2G scam, toppled the government for ever. One Coal scam undid the great man MMS. Rai must be blessed to change the history of India. 
@IndianExpress Don’t worry he might land up there for a photo session also. 
@TimesNow @RShivshankar When Modi went on a world tour you did not call it a ring side seat. Get prepared you might go out of job after May 2019. 
@IndianExpress A united country vs an isolated Modi even his ministers most of them are in hospital. We don’t know if they will be medically fit by May 2019. 
@IndianExpress We have got only booze Sarkar 
@IndiaToday @RahulGandhi Why not ask this question can Modi match MMS 
@republic What a fool this Arnab is making of himself. He must understand there is something called professionalism which he seems to have pledged to his master. 
@ANI We are waiting for it. You are a perfect example of a joker. 
@moneycontrolcom Why should NE burn. Is it not what the people sold themselves for. If not the people the elected members offered themselves for a price and today NE is going through what the purchased government wants. Enjoy and be happy. 
@smitaprakash Looks like you are left out with the Tugluk and the interview is going to be your memory for life. 
@sardesairajdeep Is this Pai aiming for a ministerial birth? Now that most of the ministers are in hospital and Mohandas claims he is a CA, does he want finance ministry? Please stop buttering. 
@IndianExpress When ever this old man does not have food to eat he declares he is on fast and wants media to give title to his hunger and waste our time. When you lose credibility what ever you do has no meaning. 
@dna Kotler has found his match. 
@nistula Should not these two MLA’s be asked to resign and treat the seats as vacant until next elections and no change in the status of government. 
@RahulGandhi Why he has not conferred on himself the Barath Rathna. Is there anyone who is going to object or will there be anyone questioning him if he awards himself the Barath Rathna. 
@ShekharGupta @maneeshchhibber Sad such biscuits thrown can shake the pillars of democracy. Can we have a news on that one person called Kumaraswamy who changed the face of Tamilnadu 
@EconomicTimes Super now goal is set at 2022. Now that is 96 months 
@TimesNow 2019 a year to judge who is a bigger liar. 
@TimesNow @nsitharaman @navikakumar There is only one question it is not why Rafale. It is why AA at the cost of HAL. Smart answers is nice to hear but won’t get votes. Hope you understand and certainly media houses like Yours will lose license. 
@MasalaBai As much freedom of expression in making a comedy movie don’t you think this is also freedom of expression. 
@bsindia May be directed from Nagpur and produced by BJP. 
@sameepkapoor @Showbiz_IT @IndiaToday We are waiting for “Tugluk 2014 -2019”. Don’t infringe On Chowkidar Chor hai. This is already taken don’t copy even this. We have seen 4 1/2 year of name change and relaunch. 
@Showbiz_IT @IndiaToday Inspite of the pro media and anti MMS, if the day 1 collection is not so good, what does this show bootlicker Anupam Kher ? The only thing that you will get is a nanapalki award and a seat from BJP. This is your Waterloo in cinema. 
@ANI We know why this absurdity came from GN Rao..... because the stage was Indian Science CONGRESS. 
@sardesairajdeep Get ready for HAL to be declared sick and Ambani buying them out and Rafale manufactured in the same HAL under Ambani ownership. This is lollipop 
@IndianExpress Can you get down to work. The trailer is going on since 2014. When is the main movie going to come. Do you have anything independent of Pappu to even talk. Your drama is becoming a comedy show. 
@INCIndia Watch out Ericsson may have to shut shop in India soon. 
@IndiaToday @PoulomiMSaha The question is not why Rafale it is why AA. Is the media cleverly diverting the issue? Modi is missing. A clever sermon from Jaitley and Nirmala does not answer why AA and why efforts not put on HAL. Is BJP so indebted to AA? Now it is all about who is a better lier 
@smitaprakash @ShatruganSinha Looks like you have taken up the role of official media manager for the Hero? 
@AnupamPKher This should be a good comedy show. May be you also do a movie on Tugluk 2014-2019 
@IndiaToday What is the urgency to create anarchy. Should the courts not fine these guys heavily for wasting the nation’s time. 
@prasannavishy @SwarajyaMag When you are not a Hindu how can you play the role of Lord Krishna? Where are the Bakthi brigade? What is the plan. Is the publicity going to start now or after the shooting is completed? 
@EconomicTimes Bihar alliance is sleeping with an enemy 
@IndiaToday BJP is 30 years in politics and congress is over 100 years. Be prepared to taste what you invented. Fake news and Post card news. 
@IndiaToday For God sake make this guy the commerce Minister or something with a ministry. He can burn all bridges and still claim all is well. 
@IndianExpress The main culprit who played to the masters script got paid well and co artist also were rewarded. Now to claim innocent is difficult for us to digest 
@IndiaToday What is BJP upto in West Bengal. The Rath Yatra by Advani which lead to 1992 blot on the nation is still not able to heal. Even after the courts have rejected their design for dividing the state of West Bengal why are these guys so bent on taking out a Yatra. 
@Nomofa @ Shekharagupta @ Nandita_Singh 1 Less for sauce 
@sardesairajdeep @arvindsubraman @IndiaToday What you are saying now will hold credibility only if you had opened your mouth when in office. Now your word is as good as mine. Sometimes when you do not perform while in office it is equal to you double crossing the nation. 
@IndiaToday May be this guy might no know his origin itself. 
@IndiaToday What have you done part from making a short film of yourself with the sergical strikes story line. 
@IndianExpress Hee Hee there is Ambani Mama 
@ndtv Tell this guy they just lost 5 states and  the big event is due in May 2019. Speaking like this will ensure these guys forget their own origin. Who teaches them this language. Widow, bar dancer, foreign son, must be a nagpur trained coward. 
@TimesNow @thenewshour @navikakumar Legitimate question to Navika Kumar - are you on permanent payroll of BJP or Times Now? 
@IndiaToday Rahul the elections are over and the results are out. Looks like more than Amit Shah and Modi you are hurt and crying. Did you not realise this when it happened in NE, Goa, Himachal. Every dog... cow has its day and that day will make the opposition feel for it. 
@BDUTT @RahulGandhi @washingtonpost Burkha don’t you think grossly the TV channels are responsible for this type of lopsided propaganda. With no ethics and just for money this Pappu figure is built by a select channels. BJP funded it and now is not selling. Soon another marketing propaganda is going to come. 
@ieeducation_job @IndianExpress And part two of the question is the person who committed the alleged crime is taken to court and Antony the judge sits on a judgment. Now what will be the judgement and should it be referred to the Bafoon. 
@TVMohandasPai @kiranshaw @INCIndia @RahulGandhi It is puzzling to hear the sold out guys wanting to have a Jio type funding talking as though all was in pits and after the washout in 5 states talking right the opposite. 
@IndianExpress For all the yap this shadow party did and ransacked the nation, the fools got a good lesson taught. Let the nation not repeat the mistake. Let us raise above religion and not allow traitors divide us. 
@timesofindia That’s the right statement. Let not BJP get carried away with one Chai wala and one Pakoda wala. The nation is larger than these two. 
@IndiaToday @ShaktiShekhar The loss is not Raman Singh’s but entirely the Tugluk and the Bafoon from UP. The sold out media should talk on why Tugluk pulled down Raman 
@htTweets @BCCI @bbhose Rai after your 1 lakh 76 k crore BJP sponsored screw up of national politics go ahead and screw BCCI too. You are the true terminator 
@dna As it is south and east cost is BJP mukth. Let the people ensure this Tugluk does not get away lying and abusing. 
@rahulkanwal You are still fighting a battle for a party who have been a traitor before independence and now clearly messed up the nation. It is an open secret that BJP is the B team of TRS and nothing surprising as far as BJP does not cross the single digit in all the southern states 
@aashishsy @ShekharGupta Actually it is the Tugluk who is the biggest girder. Don’t find excuses. Mera pass Maa hai dialogue delivery will not last. This guy is destroying the nation. The Monk is a bafoon and we need not make him a Variable for the reality of BJP. 
@IndianExpress Next which agency are you going to destroy? Why don’t you directly hand over the parliament to your RSS and the nation can for even become Indian Pakistan. We wished Sardar not only banned should have hanged the traitors for good. 
@ShekharGupta @MISHRAACHYUT Does he include his mother also in his cheap widow remark. It is not about a foreign beti whom in his Chai per chercha he blabbers, he is getting exposed on his disregard for women. 
@IndianExpress He has over 85% vote share and this is what the people have asked for so be it 
@radhikabordia Few ministers have politely declared they are not contesting elections. BJP leader speaks out atleast now about the imminent danger of dividing the society. A few of the bureaucrats have as an after thought spoke of the Tugluk of a leader the party has. Sense prevails atleast now 
@IndianExpress Should this Monk be given yet another title ‘Accidental Cheap Minister’? 
@dna @sudhirchaudhary Sold out media should be slippered not muscled 
@htTweets @rsprasad Only BJP can. All others have to be checked and kept under control. 
@dna Please send him for medical check up and ensure he has a spine. 
@TimesNow Create unrest. Ensure the entire nation is not in peace. 
@OmarAbdullah @JmuKmrPolice And the Monk goes to see the cow. 
Among the line up at West Bengal the tallest leader of BJP Biplab is there. Do you want see all together don’t miss it. After all one does not see all jokers on one stage. 
@TimesNow If BJP loses in Telangana let us rename you as ..... before we say anything can you go to your state and look at some human beings not cows alone. 
@CNNnews18 @BJP4India @myogiadityanath Don’t you know anything else apart from name changes? 
@bhupendrachaube Change of government. Bhupen what ever phishing you do and seed your Sanghi thoughts, it is a fact that UP is currently lead by a Monk who is selling UP 
@IndiaToday BJP has been in power in Rajasthan and our man forgets that and says people want development. Sometimes, in your entire tenure, when you spent only on campaign what else can we expect. Can you pronounce one development done by your party in Rajasthan? 
@IndianExpress Soon this guy will be talking about the Jockey that is worn by Rahul and the langoti if at all he wears one. What substandard PM the nation has got itself into. 
@sagarikaghose @arvindsubraman Are all those in the ministry of Finance cowards. They have betrayed the nation for all 2 years. The actions of BJP can be reviewed but the spineless hypocrites like these should actually be put behind bars for misleading the nation. 
@ndtv When are we going to do the same to people who divide, created hatred, Polaris. A manipulative person who was a prime accused in 2002 massacre. 
@bsindia @RBI What an idea. How come RBI has become such illiterates 
@AnkitLal Next CAG is going to come under the direct Tuglukism from the super Tugluk. We have seen the RBI, CBI, Film Institute, 
@TimesNow @Swatij14 Why did Rahul ask about his religion, he should have asked what kind of a man this guy is rather than what kind of a Hindu this man is. 
@TimesNow Should RSS have sacked Modi when he went to Pak without an invite? 
@sardesairajdeep Such people who try to pollute the nation with such statements should be pulled up and shamed. Who are these guys to create a divide among nation, religion and caste. Tell him to restrict his stupidity to his master channel. 
@ndtv What were you doing when in office. We would appreciate people who blindly support or talk open about the monumental disaster called demonitization, but not cowards like you who neither made it a success nor stopped it. 
@abpnewstv Why are you name the chowkidar’s father. He will start crying now and he will ask for your Gothra. 
@moneycontrolcom What a pity. To meet the chowkidar one has to pay under the head donation. So if the donation is higher will the chowkidar come home? Will this be grouped under Jumla or under Tuglukism? 
@drharshvardhan @RahulGandhi If only so much application of mind had been done by you people for governing we as a nation will be a much better place. Useless Ministers time spent on analysis on Gothra don’t you think you are wasting public time and money. Please grow up and learn what governance is. 
@BoriaMajumdar @M_Raj03 @BCCI If this is true for once the media should come together for the cause of the greatest women cricketer of our times and force Ramesh Power to step down. Don’t allow individual ego to destroy the sports person in Mithila Raj 
@moneycontrolcom @RBI Boss have consideration. Elections are coming and where do we go for money. We can’t do another demonitization. The Ambani- Adhani types have been milked in 2014 and they are after us for ROI. 
@firstpost Don’t do that you might have Smithi Irani deputed to Goa as your next CM still worse you will have Sambit Patra. 
@TimesNow It is certified by the Joker that Lord Hanuman is a Dalit. Wait before next phase of elections this idiot will come with details of Gothra and Nakshatram of Lord Hanuman. Now we understand people do what they know best no matter what role they are given. 
@TimesNow Hi someone can you put this guy in his place. The Chief Minister of a state needs some responsibility and accountable. This guy seems to be totally lost in his gifted post and going around talking things which he claims to be best at. What is this Dalit Hanuman? 
@TimesNow Dr Singh, he won’t understand what you are saying. Poor guy. 
@abpnewstv Wait for breaking news when he reveals his longoti. Stupid’s go do your work rather than covering cheap news 
@rskaravadra @TimesNow When this great man called a lady jersey cow and another 50 Cr girl friend where did this Bakthi go. Drama band Karo. Kam zadha hai. 
@IndianExpress We miss you Biplab. It has been sometime now that we have heard your intelligent speech’s 
@BJP4India @AmitShah @republic Lie, lying, loud. I thing only your channel will think of broadcasting this humour. 
@news18dotcom @CNNnews18 Super. 
@NairSundar @TimesNow Reap what you sow 
@bajwa60618 @TimesNow This particular channel along with Republic are more shameful than the person who goes crying to them. Do you recall jersey cow that too addressing a lady and talking about milking? Sexual harassment case should be slapped on him. 
@TimesNow Why is the PM crying for a simple question of what is the legacy and does anyone know about the famous chaiwala’s baap. When he abuses Nehru and Indira and neech statements lik jersey cow, hybrid calf can be made why not this simple question. 
@ShekharGupta Are we common people going to put up with such immature statements. A chaiwala who told Harvard is noting to hard work, what else can we expect. This PM will be remembered more that Md Bin Tugluk 
@ndtv One return gift this Tugluk starts crying and trying to use it as his election theme. This actor does not know anything about law to talk or he is reducing the nation’s intelligence to his level. The cheapest PM the nation has ever got. Hope your mother puts sense in you. 
@ndtv Why drag nana nani cry baby? When you can abuse every one just one simple statement is making you cry. Don’t you have any other content. 
@TimesNow Why is you master crying for the smallest mud slinging by the congress. When he normally abuses Nehru-Indira-Rajiv-Sonia, he starts complaining like a child? Please tell him what he serves will be served back with thanks 
@abpnewstv Do a set of people belonging to a non registered association who do not consider the constitution of our country important and who can openly denounce the SC be allowed to walk and talk what he wants. Is the government so lame that it cannot safe guard the nation and assure peace 
@ndtv Is media making the talking points of our most loved PM. As such there is no content in what our most loved PM speaks. Now who is the father what is his mother age are they important for the nation to listen to in prime time. Media stop prostitution of your profession please 
@_pallavighosh @SushmaSwaraj @HardeepSPuri @HarsimratBadal_ Why Sambit Patra was not invited. He seemed to be over excited and abused Sidhu for this idea. We will be glad if this loud mouth  Sambit Patra is sent instead 
@ndtv We cannot furs if a joker or an idiot is talking. 
@OmarAbdullah @MehboobaMufti Omar you should have asked mufti to send the fax to his head quarters in Nagpur. You could have called his master alternatively. 
@moneycontrolcom Where is your nana nani? Where is your wife? You should also know others can invite your family on to the stage as much you do. We understand that is the only thing you know while congress can talk of other things also. But be ready for mud sling by them too 
@IndianExpress We are also in the same thought about you. Are you a name change CM or a Joker in the BJP party. 
@TimesNow @arunjaitley @navikakumar How many failed ministers in BJP government can read and write? 
@ndtv Fraud- Demonitization was monumental fraud on the nation 
@IndianExpress Is this fall an early signal for the Pakoda party. 
@TimesNow @RShivshankar Are you the only channel who keeps the schedule of your news. Every time there is elections this stupid news of all are out to kill the Tugluk is readout. Shivshankar don’t you feel like laughing when you read this. 
@ndtv Only when you do something there can be any issue. Apart from Nehru family abuse did you have even one to take about. This shows your inability to do anything worthwhile for us to even critic you. 
@Dandvata I have a mother? Stop Beta Drama, Less 
@IndianExpress Will you ever save India by abusing the Nehru family. When you are hit below the belt it hurt right. Learn decency and mature as a politician stop drama and start working. When did you go to PM’s office last? 
@IndianExpress We have heard give me 50 days else... Idiot are born not made. 
@bhupendrachaube @INCIndia @PMOIndia @BJP4India Has the media ever fanned the third rated statements of Mouna Modi, Pakoda Shah? Just sit back and relax. I know it hurts when a shade of  your party colour is shown but you have no choice 
@bhupendrachaube some time conscience talks. Look what people like you have done to your profession. It is a shame when you pledge professional ethics and be happy with bootlicking. Rowdy Arnab, shameless Navika, Bootlicker Bhupen are the titles we give to the real prostitution of journalism 
@ShekharGupta High time the courts step in and summons the Tugluk to the courts and tell him to stop meddling with democracy 
@bhupendrachaube @INCIndia @BJP4India @CNNnews18 Bhupen is going to be the Rowdy Arnab of 2019. The outrightly boot polish he is doing seems he is paid well and won’t mind bum polishing too. Shame on you and you bring shame to journalism. 
@ndtv Hope every party patriots do this to their rivals. How will it be if this is done to Modi? 
@ShekharGupta For this Tugluk he cannot see his back. 
@ndtv Just read the comments and we will know who has a phobia. These guys think they are gospel and what they say becomes nation’s agenda. Stupid’s have been voted to power and they have been fully exposed on their ability to govern. Times has come for us to give the verdict 
@IndianExpress BJP bans beef in UP and keep their trap shut in Goa. May be Tugluk would not know this as he is busy finding out what Nehru family is doing. 
@ndtv Hee heee Shah has lost his talking points and Rahul has given his speech to Shah. 
@dna Is Modi applying for congress president post. He is appealing, begging, shouting for one term. He is constantly talking about congress may be he has nothing to talk about his party. 
@news18dotcom @CNNnews18 @RahulGandhi @narendramodi Careful Rahul. The Tugluk will call you for a debate in the Republic channel where his bootlicker will anchor the debate very neutral 
@TimesNow Congress must be mad to ask this guy to name one person outside the sangparivar as their president. This guy himself is named by the cowards. May be they need instructions from the England Queen their great grand mother. 
@calamur @IndianExpress Then why are you so petrified by the very name of Nehru and Rahul. Are you not able to recover even after 4 1/2 years of your Tuglukism. 
@Ram_Guha Can the spineless AAI, RSS and BJP be sent invites and given the last row in the concert. Krishnan should dedicate all the songs to  these hypocrites. 
@Ram_Guha Though I am not a big fan of AAP, this act of having Krishnan in Delhi show they have what it take to stand up to the bullies. I wish all at the concert show their middle finger to the  RSS cowards and the BJP shadow party 
@abpnewstv @BJP4India Tugluk are you still have doubts on the results of demonitization? You are behaving like the King in his new clothes - emperors new cloths. We feel disgusted with your histrionics. Please see a doctor on your Nehru phobia 
@bhupendrachaube @MamataOfficial @ncbn Yet another institution has been diluted and now RSS cowards are going to release their constitution and ways of governing after raping almost every institution. Bhupen will you be able to ask this ever to your Master. 
@ANI Actually you have not realised that you are the PM - Prime Minister of India. Can you stop talking like a Pakoda Man? Have you ever in the 4 1/2 years talked with any dignity. We call it as Pedigree and you as a Chai wala completely lack it. A shame on the nation to have a Tugluk 
@IndiaToday Of all this Tugluk is giving a certificate on Nehru? This is what is called kaliyug. 
@bhupendrachaube @nitin_gadkari Bhupen is this call d the art of prostitution with journalism. 
@ndtv The cheapest person to have been elected to the post of Prime Ministership. Hope the nation realises the mistake and not vote for this Tugluk. He thinks he can get away with histrionics and no real work. When did he last attend the parliament? Democracy has to be saved from BJP. 
@bhupendrachaube @sgurumurthy Bhupen sound sic. Are you a journalist or a broker? Your post has all superlatives and that too for a person who was no one but a yellow magazine editor which hardly has 1000 readership. Boot licker join the cowards in Nagpur or the shadow party acting on behalf of the cowards 
@ShekharGupta Will these starved people do the same if it is AR Rehman, Zakir Hussain, 
@TimesNow First tell this idiot we as Indians know what patriotism is and we don’t need traitors to certify us. Next these stupid’s should win and that is next to impossibility. Lastly tell him before we kick him on his butt tell him to shut up. 
@IndianExpress Should the guy who spent his 5 years finding fault on Nehru be allowed to pay respects to the first prime minister of India? 
@ndtv A failed Minister talks about failed politics? The irony is a person who when sitting in the chair of finance did not even know of demonitization, a minister who was sitting in defence did not even know about Rafale, is talking of failure. First learn to be a human. 
@ndtv Person who does not believe in democracy is talking. We should not forget this person has failed on all fronts since 2002. 
@ANI Then Shah will be renam d as Amit Shame 
@bhupendrachaube Are you worried or becoming nervous Bhupen. 
@bhupendrachaube @VasundharaBJP @INCIndia @RahulGandhi Bhupen can you even think of making a suggestion to you master. Why don’t you keep doing your bootlicking job and mind your business instead of suggesting what Rahul should do. 
@IndianExpress Is this the only promise you can make. Look at the election manifesto this BJP can think of. Time and again it is proving to be a party of no capability. Only stupidity and nonsense. Hope this is enough for these guys to be blocked and shunned. 
@TimesNow Can you ask the question between Manmohan Singh and Modi who is a better leader? 
Can you ask between Rahul and Modi who is a better person? 
Navika don’t worry you will get even better post than Rowdy Arnab. 
@IndianExpress Do you want to lose even that one seat you won by chance Mr Yeddi? 
@sardesairajdeep @IndiaToday The shadow party lost hence no coverage by the prostitutes of media. Even if one street corner seat is won by the shadow party all the paid media houses will do analysis and say why Rahul should not wear underwear and how Modi and Shah washed their back today. 
@IndianExpress Is rename such an easy one? Why Congress not rename some states, cities and towns after Nehru, Indira, Rajiv. 
@svaradarajan @thewire_in Why not rename India after Modi? 
@BHARGAV_GN @BlueMoor @CNNnews18 Is your problem Rahul or religion frustrated guy. Can you read the constitution and come back instead of just lying and pretending over here. 
@BHARGAV_GN @BlueMoor @CNNnews18 What happened to your brave defence. Your colour faded? Frustrated guys, let the nation in peace. 
@BHARGAV_GN @CNNnews18 Your problem got exposed. Don’t hide. 
@BHARGAV_GN @BlueMoor @CNNnews18 Shadow party purchased most of the states and some already saw the true colours of Tugluk. Don’t worry people will give a chance but when they strike it is very brutal. What happened to j&amp;k, Andhra? Any problem with the purchase terms. 
@BHARGAV_GN @BlueMoor @CNNnews18 The purchase officer of the shadow party took Diwali leave. Why you could not win even 50% seats? Did people of karnataka see your HAL goofing 
@BHARGAV_GN @CNNnews18 So your problem is exposed and all this intelligence is a cover. Why don’t you go for a refresher course in trolling and baktha chants. 
@BHARGAV_GN @CNNnews18 Please read the role of the Governor. Please read the constitution and even if don’t understand it ask your IT cell to decode it. Ignorance does not mean you can question it. 
@ndtv @myogiadityanath The problem is this happening once in 5 years and every time before elections. Why? Are you the Monk who sold the Taj? 
@BHARGAV_GN @CNNnews18 Apart from the Nagpur constitution, when the SC is hearing it, it bars. Some won’t understand democracy and constitution for that matter even governance. Only destructive politics and remember Ram before elections. 
@EconomicTimes Congratulations Karnataka and reposing faith on democracy and peace. 
@CNNnews18 Governor who is a constitutional authority is talking against it. 
@BJP4India Look who is talking about lies. 4 1/2 year of lies and now you want us to sing your song of Cong is lying? How the GDP calculation changed? How Lok adalat is no more a important issue? Liers and fools who do not know to govern but only lie. 
@ANINewsUP @ANI Rename party. 
@TimesNow @GVLNRAO Welcome back GVLNRao. Looks like you had gone for a refresher course in Jio Institute. Now Some Bit Patra will disappear and you will take forward. Looking forward for some bull shit from you. 
@bsindia @arunjaitley Spectrum and Rafale have a similarity. Like how entire BJP defends the Ambani and claim the French picked Reliance and we believe you, you will have to believe the lift stopped as a coincidence. Sounds absurd right? Now go back to Rafale - Reliance - BJP. 
@IndiaToday @rsprasad Please tell us your stand on India, Religion, constitution, economy, we all are confused. Don’t take us back to 1947 and put the next generation in trouble. How come Ram dawns on RSS and BJP only when there is elections? Did Ram come in your dreams 
@ashu3page Don’t forget to vote for BJP. We need such party to rule us who do not know democracy and governance but can give us religion, caste, gothra. 
@IndianExpress Mootu can you make your stand clear is there a constitution you respect or only you and the Tugluk are the law. 
@abpnewstv @INCIndia When BJP media declare it is controversial the social media get this well. When Tugluk goofs up the media gracefully ignores. May be it is after 2014 that the media is truly doing prostitution of their profession as the BJP IT cell coined the word Prestitutes 
@abpnewstv @AamAadmiParty @BJP4Delhi @ManojTiwariMP why did you provoke him. If he had done what you claim he was up to, we would have missed you by now. Be safe we need idiots like you for the next term. We know just Biplab, Adithyanath alone cannot carry the Tugluk Durbar all over India. 
@firstpost @BjpBiplab That’s Biplab for us. A Lot can get transformed with a Chai and Pakoda combination. Remember Harwork is better than Harvard? A true product from the school of Jio institute of management and Modi economics. God bless India. 
@TimesNow How come Ram is shorter than Sardar? 
@IndianExpress Won’t be surprised if the police is dismissed or goes missing. After all the BJP assumes approval for all rowdy act against their opposition. Imagine if the same cheap act was done by opposition for Sardar statue inauguration 
@TimesNow @rsprasad @navikakumar Navika getting prepared for I&amp;B ministry May be. Good going keep it up.After all BJP does not have leaders there is only One Actor and many cheer leaders. People like you are props to make the leader successful. 
@ndtv What happens to those who marry and abandon their family. What happens to those who have consensual sex and father children. #RamdevforBarathrathna 
@TimesNow Navika you are next to get a plump position in BJP rule. Keep up the good job of boot licking. But ensure you lick the right one. 
@IndiaToday @Ashi_IndiaToday This guy I am sure is the B team of BJP. 
@ndtv Confused with figures? Can you highness clarify the current formula for computing GDP. Atleast can you tell how much money has come back after the monumental disaster demonitization. Fine can you tell us how many bank accounts are open under your bank scheme. Confused who? 
@lifestyle_ie @IndianExpress Then what is Nehru coat. Even the dress pattern is Nehru. Wonder if there is anything which is original of Modi. 
@EconomicTimes Look who is talking 
@TimesNow Rahul pretends to be religious and all in BJP think of religion only during elections. This is what we understand as religious frauds. Stop the bluff else GOD will punish you with many more Rahul’s 
@bsindia @ManojTiwariMP Really? If only you could reflect to what is happening to the nation RBI, CBI, banking, fuel, university, SME, farmers, your wisdom will be heard even by Rowdy Arnab and barking dogs in unison along with Some Shit Patra. 
@svaradarajan @pbmehta @jawharsircar @thewire_in Many a times worship is rewarded. When Kher can get it with a posting for his wife, a Padma award, a plump post in FIlm Institute why not the barking dog which has exhibited unconditional Bakthi. Actually the others should resign and show what this Tugluk is doing for the nation 
@saliltripathi Dogs get rewarded in BJP government. Sambit Patra the dog get a directorship in oil PSU, Rowdy Arnab a Dog in all forms gets even better. With this the Tugluk Durbar is complete. Long live Tugluk and his council of fools. 
@ndtv How come this guy was not anxious for the last 4 1/2 years. He is talking as if Lord Ram is the only wish he has and we Hindus has appointed this joker to rack up Ram every election time. Let’s first build a temple for this fool. 
@ndtv How can Rahul also lie. Lying has been contracted with this actor and no one else can lie. Got it 
@IndianExpress Look who is talking. May be he thinks lying is his forte and cannot be challenged at all. 
@svaradarajan @thewire_in It is mockery and the Tugluk cannot use the state as his father in law property appointing his pet dogs. 
@svaradarajan @thewire_in The bigger get rewarded for his improvisation in begging. Anupam Kher was a bigger earlier who was rewarded and that fool resigned recently from the alms he got for his focused begging. 
@ndtv Can we understand the clarity you people have as ministers. Who is the current external affairs minister? Who is the foreign minister? Who is the finance minister? May be we common people are confused on why did this party come to power. Is it only to keep blaming the Nehru’s? 
@ShekharGupta @PedestrianPoet Ask Sambit Patra who his father is. Is it a belief that whom he refers as father or is it reality. Let us not waste our time on this idiot who is bent on dividing and create confusion. Let us dismantle the party of hatred and cowards who seem to have gained power of late. 
@IndiaToday Because RSS sets the agenda and the shadow party BJP dances to the tunes. We should have invited RSS team for Sardar statue inauguration. 
@VishalChoradiya @BDUTT Going by the argument from the BJP that all of Akbar’s perversion was during Congress affiliations then should not his professional achievements be attributed to congress period.sounds stupid right.lets shun this absurdity and boycott this pervert called MJ Akbar. 
@IndiaToday @sambitswaraj @Pawankhera This guy Sambit Patra is full of arrogance may be learnt from his Feku master. Hope a day will come when one panellist or the camera man just walks up to him and give a tight slap. How come this idiot sits in channels apart from his home channel of Republic and Times Now? 
@sardesairajdeep Looks like a lot of us are putting up with this guy called Sambit Patra. As I always say, just one person slap him for exhibiting arrogance all will fall in place. Can’t believe he roaming around barking and gets away ever night. 
@firstpost May be Anupam Kher, Smriti Irani will appease this ABVP group. There are many institutions that are distorted by this party and now prompted by their coward party in Nagpur this protest. Let’s appoint a bunch of idiots and kill everything. We have 6 more months left hurry up. 
@ShekharGupta @nandita_singh1 What a family. Consensual sex, wife vouching for the Pervert and top it all this happened when this guy was with Congress. Idiots the news is coming out now when he is with BJP and what matters is what action BJP is taking after all the preaching on what Hinduism is all about 
@sardesairajdeep @divyaspandana Why there should be an apology? Has BJP or Modi ever apologised for the words he used on 70 years of Indian democracy and it’s steady growth. 
@TimesNow Navika you missed out Feku, Jumla, Tugluk, Actor, Joker, Hitler, Pakoda Man, Mouna Modi, NRI PM... this is what the media plays everytime there is Tuglukism exhibited. 
@sardesairajdeep Congratulations on your 30 and wish you many more years of strong and bold journalism. Your way of standing up and putting your thoughts is admired and journalist of future to learn what it takes to speak your mind. Best wishes Rajdeep. 
@IndianExpress Who is this guy accusing the SC. When the constitution of India means nothing for the RSS, this statement from with the walls of Nagpur is not surprising. Put this guy behind bars for atleast a month other cowards will go back into slumber as they have been after the British left 
@IndiaToday @Rahulshrivstv @mail_today If these actors had moved the bill in 2014 or atleast in 2015, what this coward is claiming would make sense. Now doing this drama is a clear stunt. 
@INCIndia Simple. Journalists have to learn from Arnab, Navika and their types to be alive and kicking. 
@ShekharGupta If only you had shared the photograph of Nitesh joining BJP then, this post of your would have credibility. This NCBN shift is because of step mother treatment. Nitesh shift to BJP is out of greed. Simple politics is holy under BJP, gutter under any other. People are hypocrites 
@TimesNow Nehru, Rahul.... apart from these have you ever spoken on anything. Now think what is a stuck gramophone? May be you will go mad if Rahul nominates someone else as PM candidate. 
@bhupendrachaube @smritiirani But for people like you who anchor paid news I don’t think she matters at all. Very sad to see journalism and private TV channels misleading the nation with false news and pseudo publicity to people. 
@IndiaToday Now Sardar stands tall to keep a watch on the RSS and their shadow party BJP telling the nation it was he who had banned them for anti national actions. 
@IndiaToday Patra do you know your fathers name? Don’t pollute the nation. I wish soon some guys gives you back so hard that never ever in your life you should ever think of such cheap discourse. 
@abpnewstv Will the question who is your father?be acceptable for the guys who reduce the standard of politics to this low? BJP has tore the country fabric. 
@sardesairajdeep Patra you sound cheap and low before all of us when you open your mouth. Very soon people will ask you who is your father. 
@CNNnews18 @ShashiTharoor @INCIndia @ShahnawazBJP @_pallavighosh Why is that when it comes to the shadow party it pains and they cry foul. These foul mouths party members have been doing the same day in day out. 
@TimesNow In that case the guy who intruded yesterday should be arrested first. 
@sardesairajdeep Is this save Sabarimalai gaining a RSS momentum to take Kerala under the shadow party. Will Supreme Court verdict be reversed or shadow party will sing a different song after purchasing Kerala. 
@PritishNandy There are many news channels today actually living up to the 2010 coining of Prestitutes. After 2014 most of the journalist have become devadasis of BJP party allowing them to be sold and openly prostituting their profession. 
@TimesNow If only once you had taken note of the Pappy, Mounmohan, bar dancer, cat calls made by your master BJP, your channel will have credibility. A third rated channel like yours needs skippering rather than any viewership. A true prostitution of journalism is  what TimesNow is. 
@GuruJiPolitical @sardesairajdeep @rssurjewala So what is wrong in copying a tweet? Golmaal hai na. Why people get agitated when the bluff is caught. 
@bhupendrachaube @RahulGandhi I am amazed by the way the tv channels are going all out to sing the praise of the worst Pm India has ever had. Just in the last 4 years the tv anchors has never ever flagged any of the good ups and the nation is suffering. People might forgive the BJP but certainly not the media 
@sardesairajdeep If this is the going rate why not all the elected members sell themselves. Anyways the elections and people who caste their votes have been proved to be fools. Atleast let the richest party shell out the money. 
@IndianExpress Are the BJP worried they will lose in Pakistan or they are taking the Khyber pass to forcefully capture power in India. These guys have the most innovative ideas to divert the public attention on their failures. 
@rahulkanwal Rahul can you ask what is the stands of BJP. May be you are scared to ask 
@TimesNow Who built a party called BJP with a rath Yatra and even today blabber Ram Mandir with no commitment to the shrine. Accept you belong to a shadow party of RSS who are a communal group against the very constitution of India. 
@KanchanGupta When it comes to defending the BJP, the frustrated lot do not mind if it is at the cost of the PSU’s. We have messed up BSNL, Air India, Kendriya Vidhyalya and now HAL. Let it not be seen as BJP vs Congress, let it be seen as nations progress. Don’t link shallow patriotism. 
Dr Abdul Kalam had his 87th birth anniversary yesterday and today’s paper front page has no space for him. The pervert MJ Akbar takes nation’s front page and Dr Kalam has a column reference in inside pages. First let’s change the journalist then all will change 
@ShreePanicker @KanchanGupta Job well done by the acting Defence Minister. Had to rush to France and redo the papers and sign and include HAL....Hee heee and now the statement of HAL not competent given by all the enlightened members stands cancelled...Hee heee 
@ShekharGupta This yet again proves that all people can be fooled all times. Present as though nothing has happened and don’t accept anything that is happening. The common man is a fool. No one will protest- see did anyone protest for fuel price, demonitization. Only Modi is true 
@CommonM00703709 @MinhazMerchant Is it. We are experiencing a Banana Republic and you are trying hard to say no because it is one Minister of extramarital affairs? 
@ShreePanicker @ChandrusWeb Look how a set of people are diverting from the base question why HAL was side stepped favouring Reliance and brilliantly talking like the Showman with no content and logic and for every Tuglukism of Showman the chorus team starts their jarring chants. 
@ShreePanicker @ChandrusWeb @KanchanGupta @republic Can I use the modicare which is also waiting for Reliance Insurance approval. Different forms of Bakthas are floating around and the common man has to take care for sure. Jai Hind. 
@ShreePanicker @ChandrusWeb @KanchanGupta @republic The common man is watching. We are seeing what is happening to Kendra vidhyalaya and the Neetha Ambani schools and now HAL and Anil Ambani start up aerospace. May be soon Air India will also become a group company of Reliance. Our premise will be the base when we vote. 
@IndiaToday Is this the only agenda of the Adhityanath government 
@TimesNow Where are the unions and spine of the HAL leadership team. Like the bank unions were quite inspite of the blunder of demonitization the HAL employees are doing a mistake of not showing their protest against the government for back channelling Reliance to Rafale. 
@republic Why not make yet another RSS coward the CEO of HAL? Will that help HAL get the order instead of a 12 day old company called Reliance? 
@CNNnews18 @RahulGandhi Now we need to see how many HAL employees are going to be hired by the startup Anil Ambani Rafale India company. Let’s see if the unions are really powerful and can block Reliance from hiring even one. 
@IndiaToday @Geeta_Mohan Hee Hee MJ Akbar you are talking about women empowerment? 
@TimesNow @sambitswaraj The question is simple why Reliance a 10 day old company and we are also asking can BJP play with nation security at the cost of Dosthana. 
@ndtv One needs enough arrogance to make this statement even after making the nation split on eating habits, language, religion, caste, economy and what not. Today makes a statement that BJP unites and congress splits. Hope the common man spits on them when it really matters. 
@ShekharGupta @AmritaNayak3 Why are there no RSS nominees for this post? 
@abpnewstv @PiyushGoyal Atleast he is talking. None of you ministers including the Mouna Modi have opened your mouth on Ambani ka Rafale deal. Are you people selectively dumb? 
@IndianExpress You wear saffron and speak all nonsense. How come you get votes and people put up with you? 
@ndtv South or North? 
@ndtv Even if a slate is given you can’t do anything Mr Jootlie 
@ETNOWlive @RBI @nehabothra_7 So what if RS is 74/- it shows that our exporters will realise better revenue per sale. Does it do any harm. Only importers will suffer, does it worry when we are pushing make in India. 
@TimesNow It is a statement of fact and there is nothing political about. If Dog is derogatory what to do. Then the statement should be not even a cow? 
@CNNnews18 @INCIndia @rssurjewala People should take this up strongly and bring the nation to a halt. Why this sudden cowardlyness from the common man is something history will talk about. 
@abpnewstv Are we getting ready for another Reliance - Rafale type of railway order? 
@nitingokhale Is there his the right time to talk about HAL under performance? Does this justify Reliance a company created to take the order. In the same logic can you write about the current PM’s performance compared to a score of PM’s India has had. Don’t misguide the nation. 
@ndtv Jootlie your next 1 year is going to be a nightmare 
@ShekharGupta @ShashiTharoor The ideology that garlanded Godse should it be allowed to garland the Mahatma? 
@abpnewstv When will government askfor an update on people affected by demonitization, non government nance, marketing and no action. 
@IndianExpress Its ok if BJP manages to win or purchases government  next term but this idiot should lose his deposit and even his own family should not vote for him. How come all idiots have bunched together under one roof. 
@IndiaToday First you make something. Having stolen the mandate and still not able to do anything is a pity 
@IndianExpress Just because most of the BJP ministers cannot speak English, You don’t have to adjust and talk for the sake of it. 
@abpnewstv @smritiirani @RahulGandhi We want you to go back and do acting. Will that happen? Why this cheap TV dialogue like your super Hero? Can you do some worthwhile work for the position you managed to get. 
@abpnewstv @nsitharaman One straight question how can a 10 day old company get a defence deal. that to pertaining to nations security. 
@geetv79 @RahulGandhi They have been handed over to BJP IT cell. Any problem. BJP for the people, by the people and of the people only change replace people with Ambani- Adhani - all who are called as Modi - Lalith - Nirav and many more who knows. 
@moneycontrolcom Actually you need have one since every minister is so versatile that anyone can talk on any ministry. 
@svaradarajan @thewire_in Ambani Bar Bar as far as Modi Government bar bar 
@ndtv So now he is aviation minister 
@ETNOWlive What a relief to the common man. As a citizen I can live in peace from these dumb Banks, mobile companies, credit card companies and for that matter even the public toilets asking if I have an Aadhaar. The only business sense this Aadhaar panic created was Jio success. 
@IndianExpress There is only BJP conspiracy. Don’t have to twist the Ambani- BJP love affair into a war. For BJP everything is fair in love and war 
@IndianExpress Congress lost the perception battle in 2014 and with in 4 years BJP is in deep trouble with the same perception which was invented by them. There is always one supernatural power which pays you back instantly. One need not wait fo the next janma. 
@IndianExpress Shah thinks BJP is a global party when it is not even a national party. BJP will not even have 25 k votes in south leave alone 25 seat. Now he is talking about Pak. He must be what Jootlie referred to - nation’s clown. 
@abpnewstv @rsprasad Can you come to the point on Rafale - Ambani - BJP. We are not going to be fooled and join your party for your problem with one family. You have a fear and don’t include us. The best we can do is refer you to a Doctor. Don’t drag the country to solve your personal issues 
@bsindia @RahulGandhi @arunjaitley Hope the French government does not sue Jootlie for the frustration he is showing on all even outside India. According to BJP all lie and only BJP is holy than thou. We have seen how desperate you guys are for power. You are capable of even pledging India for your survival 
@IndiaToday You people have played into the hands of RSS what to do. 
@bhupendrachaube Bhupen if only you journalist had not prostituted your profession The ruler would not have gained so much of arrogance. The pillars of construction is weakened by Rowdy Arnab, Soldout Navika, his masters voice Bhupen 
@IndianExpress Now DU has become patriots and JNU desh drogis? What a failed Minister we have 
@ndtv You need to be hit by slippers for you to realise the burden. The people who voted for you should be cursing themselves to have elected you. 
@timesofindia @TOIBusiness Boy this guy is talking finance of late? Many be Mallaya set fire in the back and atleast after 4 years this failed Minister is rushing through his portions. 
@abpnewstv @nsitharaman Is explaining the health of HAL an after thought. Is Ambani story not holding in the long run? Are people going to question “ is HAL important or Reliance important.” 
@dna If only the first act of violence from this party was punished such daring act would not have happened. This party is building a nation of law breakers. 
@arunjaitley Now the latest he had some papers in hand and he did not receive it. 
@ndtv @nsitharaman Hope you win a seat first. 
@NaMo_SARKAAR @bhupendrachaube @TheVijayMallya Pakoda logics cannot be beaten. Tugluk Sarkaar is more apt. Musical chair ministers. Bark and go on hiding after a press meeting ministers. Have you yet found one sound logic for monumental disaster demonitization? 
@svaradarajan @bainjal @thewire_in When the hypothesis is proved that all people can be fooled all times why not move even more forward 
@mjakbar Congratulations MJ. A lie is a lie in what every form it is. Down with PSU’s, let’s become a liberal crony capitalism. Hope Ambani continue to find the nation’s engine- the government 
@ArvindKejriwal Changing face of India- no challenge for demonitization, no debate on GST, tolerant on high fuel prices, no report on inflationon, no vegetable vendor protest. Tamed India Pavlo theory of condition learning 
@svaradarajan @thewire_in When a BJP backed channel is asked to apologise for false reporting how will they it when their very profession is to create false reports. Just ignore and do give sound bits to them they will have a natural death. 
@ANI Because this chopping statement comes from a congress man, in the Tugluk regime an anti national, we won’t be surprised if police act swiftly. 
@abpnewstv @SushilModi Nitish you had claimed to not have association with Lallu when he was charged with corruption. Now Modi, oops all Modi’s seem to have a problem , is charged, you of course won’t resign right. 
@abpnewstv I wonder where the citizens have gone. Earlier the entire nation through the paid media debated the effect of fuel price rise and how basic food cost will go up and inflation will sky rocket and nation will starve. We had stalwart Smriti, Jetley, Sushma. Have they become dumb 
@IndiaToday Very sad that such an incident happened and the insignificant politician successfully enacted a drama. The cabin crew who is the custodian of the aircraft did not complain and this no one along with the state handle does a one day standoff. Damage done for both. 
@ShekharGupta @pragyakaushika In TN cinema we have Rajinikanth  and NalaniKantha and similarly MGR and Mukamuthu. The common man knows who is original and who is not. 
@EconomicTimes It is not discipline it is Tuglukism 
@IndianExpress What a shameful person we have. When will he realise that the nation unfortunately has voted for him to govern and not to do dance drama? 
@ndtv Don’t spread dirt? Who said this? which party does this idiot belong? 
@the_hindu Every penny will be collected and channelised to the dhandar- founders of BJP. 
@abpnewstv @INCIndia @RahulGandhi When a low level thinking person preside over a party what else can we expect. One says don’t spreed dirt and other drops poison. No one condemned this nor have they done it since the days of Godse “JI”. 
@ShekharGupta Why is the majority netizens always jump in with blinders when any mirror is shown to them? Are they part of “kings new dress” or they think come what may, we the majority will do the way we feel. Right or left. 
@CNNnews18 Is there any credibility to these figures when it comes from BJP? 
@EconomicTimes Do these numbers have any credibility under this government. The trust has been breached when the government started changing the computation method. Feku mera nam. 
@IndiaToday @PrakashJavdekar Our minister for education has never opened his mouth on matters concerning education but very articulate on defence. Are they playing musical chair? 
@TimesNow @navikakumar Is your news dictated from the lotus office or your journalism skills is of this level only? What a shame you are to journalistic profession. 
@ndtv @sambitswaraj Have you people done anything independent. It is evident that you guys live like a parasite on Rahul Gandhi and cannot sleep peaceful as long as that person is there. Nightmares and sleepless days. 
@vineetjaintimes What will happen to the IT cell of the great party? Will you hey join the larger population of being jobless.? Will people like Sambit Patra take Santa’s? 
Biplab strikes back to shadow the raids and arrests of the activists and the social media is going to run parallel. Meta IT cooliees swing into action 
@abpnewstv Is he going to be the deen of Jio institution 
@bhupendrachaube @RahulGandhi No doubt about the 2002 and Bhupen the question should cover who is responsible for Babri, Rath Yatra, Godhra, parliament attack, mumbai blast, Mahatma Gandhi assassination, and one part fit all. Guess you are setting the narrative by diverting from the current disturbed India. 
@EconomicTimes May be he is talking about his health which is cleaned and the doctors have told him that they have tried to clean his system and atleast now function as a responsible politician 
@BJP4India @sambitswaraj We feel sorry for you Sambit. You actually have a very tough job more than that of the Tugluk. You are expected to bark every day and there is no other person from your kennel barking along with you nower days.why? 
@BJP4India @SudhanshuTrived Sudhanshu should we also call you a chamcha, boot licker, Pakoda wala, Tugluk team wala. Can’t you do politics any better idiot. 
@OmarAbdullah It hurts when the mirror , in this care the microphone is turned on them. The nation has not forgotten the hurried foreign trips that was made and the sponsored cacophony. What goes up has to come down. 
@IndiaToday If the same time as told when the great orator went around talking all that should not have been talked, this would not have happened. Now all are washing lenin out side the country. Simple. Why cry foul now? 
@mdsgar @ CNNnews18 @ BJP4India @sambitswaraj @RahulGandhi Selective hearing? 
@TimesNow @sambitswaraj If the murder of the Mahatma is done by a set of people who today are called Godse JI then they may be rightly called as you mention 
@CNNnews18 @BJP4India @sambitswaraj @RahulGandhi Why is BJP rattled? Did they not realise that the opposition will also go on the roof top and shout. Don’t forget it was Modi who set the trend of going abroad and abusing the past. Sambit you guys are going to see the worst coming don’t go away wait 
@lakskh Ithuku piche edukalam. Is there a question 
@lakskh A lie told with the nation’s money cannot become a patriotic bakth bark. Cowards are those who hid behind the British and today try to raise rewrite history. 
@lakskh I guess the Tugluk and the entire Bakthas piss in your pants when the name of Pappu is heard. What an obsession 
@lakskh Hard try. I don’t drink and more specifically the paid cooliees are given hard liquor too is it? 
@lakskh For that Chai and Pakoda? 
@lakskh The mind says it all. A building ? Over a temple? What a coward? 
@lakskh While I do it , why don’t you tell your Pakoda Man 
@lakskh Babri the root cause of all communal disturbance. Rath Yatra got derailed and one Pakoda Man master minded all. My nation is beyond all cheep communal politics 
@lakskh Your choice is between Tugluk and Pappu. That is what your limited mind can reach out to. 
@lakskh Even your party will not be able to buy like the Governments you purchase. 
@lakskh Remember 2002? 
@lakskh You might lose your job. All dummy handles and spew venom in the society. First pick up courage and have a face for yourself. 
@lakskh A set of cowards who killed Mahatma Gandhi and today talk of Godse Ji. Shame on such sold outs. A party who did not want to unfurl the national flag is fanning hatred and religious divide is calling the nation backward until the unfortunate 5/2014. A Tugluk in action. Won’t last 
@lakskh How much are you paid for this. Are you paid per post or monthly cooliee.? 
@lakskh TimesNow and Republic is a sold out channels and only Bakthas will keep quoting them 
@lakskh This is yet another fake news 
@lakskh I know what I build and certainly not a faceless coward standing as cheer group clapping for Pakoda and chai 
@lakskh When a cut copy past government has captured power by steering emotions of religious divide we cannot expect any better. It is not opposing MMS it is playing politics in Kerala o we troubled waters 
@lakskh A faceless IT paid cooliees will obviously parrot what they are paid for. If you feel the nation was never strong and you make beli e the nation was built last 4 miserable years, your days are numbered 
@lakskh Why are you copy cats following a MMS who according to you was dumb? The more logic you bring to the table the arrogance is evident and the intention of driving the election agenda is evident 
@lakskh The nation was and is strong. a Tugluk started touring and about his heroism and abusing the past that is shameful.Please recall how desperate the Bakthas were and tried to influence the nation. I will not call you or your clan names but still worse is the tag blind Bakthas. 
@lakskh May All the religions and community uplift your Bakthi Marga. I was wondering how the Bakthi Brigade functions. All doubts cleared. Amen. Salam malekum. 
@avishektalukdar @sagarikaghose @timesofindia Should we say the Mouna Mohan was magnanimous and when the misuse happened (a la 2014 party funding) there was tightening. 
@avishektalukdar @sagarikaghose @timesofindia I am sure you are happy with your interpretation of this politics of ‘Thank You’ for foreign fund. What happened at Uttarakhand, Gujarat can we also take it as the GST interpretations of the then CM of Gujarat and the now PM of India. Jai Hind. 
@lakskh Where should you be counted 
@sagarikaghose @timesofindia If accepting foreign fund is a damage to the pride of the nation what should we take for when loads of people are sent out of India to earn their livelihood in a foreign country. We need not talk about the loss of self esteem of these people? 
@sagarikaghose @timesofindia If center accepts foreign fund them the opposition in Kerala will use it for showcasing development during 2019 elections. What will BJP do and what else can they do in Kerala to capture power? 
@IndiaToday Can someone fart on his face 
@dna Did PM Modi insult the sentiments of the BJP cadres by writing to the Pak PM. While the patriots are wanting a total boycott of Pak, Modi has insulted by having a line of communication 
@IndianExpress Why not BJP open a desk for Hindu collection for Hindu Kerala. Stupid party and stupid journalist covering stupidity 
@TimesNow @tehseenp Don’t joke. How can the Pakoda Man write. Has he gone to school? 
@IndiaToday @PreetiChoudhry Can you do a show on Did Modi insult India by gate crashing to Pak PM birthday party uninvited. 
@TimesNow Can we read this like this - BJP rushes to protect the right to hug and exchange Briyani as that of Modi alone and any other trying to do the same will be charged with sedation 
@htTweets Now should we blame Nehru for this? 
@ndtv Idiot Some Shit Patra is an the Tugluk who took a flight and hugged the Pak PM on his birthday give an explanation. High time this idiot is slippered in public 
@timesofindia May be that is the only place where he has not toured during the 5 years? 
@vikramchandra I remember the August 15th 2013 speech of a Gujarat CM covered by the media more than the PM’s speech from the Red Fort. That was a beginning of the media up on sale. No wonder media will soon be a lap dog of the people in power and can be purchased. Let’s pray for true press. 
@TimesNow @thenewshour @navikakumar Navika we  feel sedation charges has to be filed on you in particular and channels of your type to be gutted. What are you trying to lick don’t you have any basic journalism in you. 
@sardesairajdeep @TimesNow @ImranKhanPTI Should Times Now be booked for sedation and spreading animosity between India and Pakistan when the nation and NaMo single handed is building bridges by going for birthday parties and having sideline meetings with Pak. 
@CNNnews18 @EramAgha This will turn out to be a best seller fiction of the century 
@svaradarajan @thewire_in He is going to framed as anti national and may be funded by ISISI. 
@svaradarajan @thewire_in May be this is what we call as an impotent statement. 
@CNNnews18 Some irrelevant person tries to give his view a coward in all sense. He is the editor of a bit notice rightly called Tugluk. Was jay the CM when she was put to rest at Marina? For 94 years these clan which assassinated the Mahatma could not even open their mouth. 
@IndianExpress Sad 
@TimesNow @kalaignar89 Do these guys matter in TN? Just brush them aside and if need be stamp them so that they do not even dream of setting their foot in Dravida nadu. 
@bhupendrachaube And we know which idiot is barking on this and thinking that he is changing the narrative. Some day this paid journalist is going to get a tight slap on his face so that never ever he will open his mouth. 
@CNNnews18 When petty people are given stage for a particular reason, they start thinking it is because of them everything is moving and issue statements which anyway is a party which is a non starter in the Dravidian state. 
@IndianExpress Are you saying no reservation or no job? 
@BJP4India We appreciate your courage to now fight out the label stuck on your party as a lier party. Try hard, we feel it is not going to be easy. All the best 
@ANI I doubt if you can count 100. 
@abpnewstv @BJP4India @sambitswaraj Just like the BJP has a close relation with lies oops it is Jumla not lies. 
@TimesNow @sambitswaraj Some Shit Patra what are trying to say? Atleast the CWC is held among their party your Chai and Pakoda party meeting is dictated by the Nagpur guys who till recently did not even hoist the National flag. 
@BDUTT This is how every issue is diluted. Barkha it would have been courageous if you had chosen a different context to spill the bean. Now the arm twisting and parroting of the government ideology will conveniently take a back seat and NDTV bashing will shadow the ABP brazenness. 
@abpnewstv What to do we are also ashamed of a lot many more things don’t we sit tight looking at the things happening around us. Too many fools are acting at the same time making it difficult to  see the difference. 
@neo_pac Now you know why we want the RTI amended. 
@anuraag_saxena @BDUTT @Nidhi Thank God this guy did not ask why Nehru, Indra, Rajiv did not speak up and why should ABP channel speak. After all it is supposed to chant only one mantra if not as a owner ABP has every right to throw them out 
@svaradarajan @thewire_in How magnanimous 
@sagarikaghose The government has concluded that the people can be fooled all times. 
@TimesNow When will you have guts to call the rowdies and goons of the party who go around smelling beef and intercaste marriages? Do you have what it takes to do one neutral show you sold out channel. 
@IndiaToday India and Pak are at war for ages and Briyani party and birthday party has not been avoided. A half statement here and there is not going to help. Even the party which assassinated the Mahatma is celebrated in our own country should we put them on watch? 
@sagarikaghose I have read about Kings New Dress and now I am seeing the King. Anyone dares to say the King is without a dress will face the anger of his highness 
@ndtv I am glad someone is reminding these dokla wala that there needs to be some decorum 
@ajith_southword @sagarikaghose Can we soon see Rowdy Arnab and shameless Navika becoming IB Ministers 
@TimesNow @RShivshankar Why should it collapse only in Bengal. Should the timing be looked into? Is this a national register distraction 
@EconomicTimes Why the tent collapsed in West Bengal? Is it a lapse or a design for Bengal? Why such lapse is allowed to happen? 
@TimesNow @RShivshankar Why no senior BJP leader was seen around this rally? Was it a lapse or a design? 
@TimesNow @RShivshankar Shivashankar should you not ask if the injured were given compensation and how so many people’s life was risked for one rally? Your video and the voice over is mischievous and actually waging war against the state. 
@TimesNow Times Now stands naked before the nation. What were the BJP police doing at the airport? 
@ndtv We also want to do the same to you. 
@timesofindia This guy thought he can also get away like his master with drama and histrionics. Poor chap now has to disclose even his secretary assets. 
@IndiaToday @JaiveerShergill @sambitswaraj Is there no limit to shamelessness Some Shit Patra? The nation is spitting on your face and you are comparing how much saliva is on other peoples face. I wonder if BJP pawn of RSS can ever think, leave alone original. 
@htTweets Please send this to yet another Tugluk who did this. Wonder how all of the same IQ level occupy office of high importance at the same time. History will never forget the GEMS of BJP government including their leader. 
A news coverage on Nirav Modi and interview with Lalith Modi and of course we have the group leader. All have one common thread. Absolute brazenness. Can get away with anything. Wonder how lalith Modi is still allowed to talk what he wants. It can happen only in Modi India. 
@MeenaDee2 @RahulGandhi Jio was given free and at the same time BJP was creating a fear that if Aadhaar and mobile are not linked bank account will be frozen. After 6 months we are told Aadhaar and mobile linking is not compulsory by the courts. Who gained? Who lost? Jio Modi Sarkar....sub kuch bagho 
@htTweets He is done with 15lakhs, now he has started a house for everyone. A great story teller and sells pipe dreams for all. 
@IndianExpress Why not when the entire economy is in your party account actually BJP should purchase not contest 2019. 
@ndtv Poor BJP Legislators looks like all of them have lost a screw at the same time. 
@sagarikaghose @BJP4India We he more he lost his hair he lost his brains too. 
@sagarikaghose @ndtv Now we know why you are laughed at 
@IndianExpress They have prostituted their profession to the fellows in Nagpur. 
@htTweets She can become a CM but we are not interested 
@IndiaToday Where have you been all these day. India missed out of your brilliant rants. Did your grandfather teach you anything worthy or even he was standing outside for the Britishers to finish their job. 
@anubhutivishnoi @RahulGandhi Will you it Modi? The nation wants to know. Will you dare to do it? 
@priyankac19 @Eenadu_English Why our Bahu is not widely covered mower days?. Is this Rs 20/- the beginning of the Re-entry of Bahu rightly timed for 2019? 
@dna What a specimen you are. 
@ANI When Ddnadayal died  he told let our party people have some brains 
@ndtv @PiyushGoyal GST was delayed for 10 years then what changed Modi? 
@IndianExpress What ministry are you handling now? 
@htTweets @PiyushGoyal When did BJP take over the Swiss bank to claim credit and report on their behalf 
@BJP4India @PiyushGoyal Did you by any chance devalue the Rupee? Or did the Swiss bank did not know to count like our RBI is saying they are still counting the Money. 
@htTweets @RahulGandhi The government in Goa does not have any legitimacy. You know what this is called if it is illegitimate. Please mind your language before others call you what you are. 
@IndianExpress What Bakthi and how proactive my government is. Hope Post Card is also seen the same way. 
@TimesNow Feel sorry for this Minister who all these drama 4 years has never got proper footing of his own ministry. Even people like Anupam Kher, Smriti, Rathore are sponsored by the BJP  media well. Bihari babu please first go to Nagpur for some blessing 
@TimesNow The lie has come of age and now the bootlicking channel is trying to change the narrative. I feel these news anchors should also be pulled to courts and their licenses suspended for polluting the general public with manipulated news. 
@EconomicTimes @BJP4India @RahulGandhi A person who is not worth a pinch of salt to sit in the ruling government is talking. 
@TimesNow @madhavgk Has Times Now clearly announced they are a set of bootlickers of BJP and RSS? 
@IndianExpress Pakoda and Chai has grown these 4 years to coin English slogans. That too with a costar who does not even know which side the education department is the other who thinks he is already the Pakoda in waiting. 
@CNNnews18 @RahulGandhi @rsprasad And you guys should learn what governance is. Drama, talking about Nehru and “me too politics” is making the nation spite on your face. 
@INCIndia I wish the opposition goes all out and pay the Pakoda fellows with the same coin. The paid IT cell cooliees should run for their backs to be saved. 
@sidmtweets It is more than intellectual fraud. It is high time someone takes this Rafael order form HAL to a company which is learning to make aircraft. GST, India is 10 years behind just because of the hardworking then Gujarat CM who stopped the nation. 
@EconomicTimes These guys, where do they come from? Are they born idiots are made idiots? 
@IndiaToday We are happy that people like Some Shit Patra will always put BJP and  RSS in a spot every time he opens his mouth. 
@IndianExpress Then why you raised a privilege motion for Rahul’s return gift to the Pakoda Man. The twist of a hug caught you all on the wrong foot and now all are desperate to cahange the narrative. Even after paying so much money the media is not able to being back light on the Pakoda Man. 
@ShekharGupta In the same note can we say you can see Tuglukism in Modi 
@timesofindia @TOIBusiness We know this and it won’t be surprising if you even make Uniform GST to win elections. After all you have proved that you can do anything 
@abpnewstv @sambitswaraj @RahulGandhi @BJP4India @INCIndia Some time when high quality speech is delivered, rhetoric and Mitroon takes a back seat. Some Shit Patra you people lost the day and all these Aunty talk of like my Son is just trying to cover your Pakoda Man. 
@abpnewstv @RahulGandhi @ShashiTharoor @girirajsinghbjp Will Deenadayalan apologise for the motor mouth people in BJ P 
@sardesairajdeep Rajdeep don’t make sports also a place where we have a quota. Sports is sports and only talent matters. By this statement you are seeding wrong thoughts. 
@WithPGV @jainanil1968 Failed Defence Minister Don't disturb internal peace of the nation. 
@svaradarajan But for matters pertaining to Defence  this lady is all game to talk any crap. 
@CNNnews18 @girirajsinghbjp @RahulGandhi Are these guys so scared of their opposition that they see what each one eats and what underwear they wear. 
@sagarikaghose @BJP4India @INCIndia If you pay them anyone would do it. Do you think the gaudy talks every night in particular in Times Now and Republic is doing out of anger on Rahul or love for Modi? Yeh sub kuch paisa ka mamla. Can these paid artists talk without negativity? A vacuum in personal values. sad. 
Prime routes are sold out to private airlines. Assets of the Raj are under-utilised. Most of the recruitment to serve the Raj’s guests  are not personalised. The service is devoid of emotion. The seats are broken, toilets are badly maintained. How will the Maharaja fly? 
@ndtv Another jumla. Does the Pakoda Man know to read? He says yesterday he read in the news paper Hee heee 
@sagarikaghose This should be headlines and breaking news. Unfortunately the media is sold out and every day wait for instructions from the BJP party office on what to bark at during prime time. It is now that the press should be called Prestitute. Some day the pimps of media should go to jail 
@TimesNow We will not be surprised if Modi inaugurates the Red Fort and the Parliament building. 
@ndtv We only wish we had a PM who understood the roles and responsibilities of the most important position in the constitution rather than being on election campaign throughout the term he was elected by his party for the post of PM 
@TimesNow In such a demand made by BJP don’t you think Navika every day your party should be issuing an apology? Can you please stop this one sided news coverage and look at the gross murder of democracy done by your pay masters 
@Jiolnstitute Can I do a Phd in Pakoda and Chai in Jio Institution. When will the application be distributed. I have quite a few fools waiting for a Doctorate from Jio 
@sagarikaghose I have a good plan and a project report to build an institution can I get the tag of institution of eminence and that money and a strict 3 years time. I will buy Harvard with that money and retain that tag. That is what we call a Gujju. 
@abpnewstv We would not be surprised if Adhityanath the CM of rest of UP will chose the later option 
@ndtv Very good 1st and eminent 2nd. One can’t differentiate between the two 
@IndiaToday @narendrataneja I have a project report on Pakoda university can the Pakoda party give me institution of eminence for me to build with the money. If I don’t after 3 years remove the tag of eminence. 
@TimesNow @Shehzad_Ind How to spit on this guys face 
@sagarikaghose Where is  he fund coming for Postcard? 
@ShekharGupta Was he tipped by congress to this 
@sagarikaghose Before 2014 all such people were netas? 
@abpnewstv Just like the RSS? 
@IndianExpress May be Godse memorial will have better facilities and be maintained like a Swatch Bharat 
@IndianExpress Because the whole lot is coming from one source and he knows when to stop. 
@ANI The very statement of Su Su shows who is a naxel type and what he is suggesting. 
@ndtv We don’t know why you have still not understood that the courts have spit on your face and yet you are asking us to see what you are wanting us to see. 
@IndianExpress Are you talking about demonetization, Selective beef curry drama ? 
@TimesNow @RShivshankar Can you do a show on truth behind Sushma Swaraj tweeter trolls? Is it that community and religion has grown bigger than it was orchestrated by BJP and today it is a monster that cannot be controlled 
@abpnewstv We know that all sops will be rolled out the next 6 months. 
@IndiaToday @PadmajaJoshi It is the hate on Rahul and Congress that has got the BJP isolated more than the unity of Opposition. The media has over done their job of marketing Modi without realising the damage they have done to the nation. 
@IndiaToday @gopalkagarwal actually it should be squarely blamed on the Nehru and his family. Poor Modi what will he do about the Ganga? May be he will have a solution for Nayagra or the Thames 
@suchetadalal @PiyushGoyal Are you the only Minister in BJP or others are incompetent? You seem to talk for every ministry be it Railways, Finance, Industry. 
@TimesNow @navikakumar Is this the new narrative you are paid to chant? Did you really graduate in journalism? 
@ndtv @PiyushGoyal What a brilliant find that design was wrong 40 years back. The slack is diverted in finding mistakes in the past. Was technology as advanced as it is today? Why such diverting statements. Don’t think public are fools all the time. 
@IndianExpress Please send one special notice to Postcard who’s only job is to spread fake news. May be the source of fund from fool ka Kamal 
@TimesNow Can you also make a similar request to the paid media like TimesNow, Republic, News X and similar ones who are paid to divert and spread useless agenda for the nation. 
@IndianExpress If all money has been spent on self propaganda and failed international relationships what do you expect. We are sure Ambani, Adhani types will provide the election fund 
@TimesNow Next two days all confusion is to start 
@TimesNow After 4 1/2 years and trying all melodrama today has started the empty coffers and decayed economy. Are we to listen to yet another bluff. The selective media truncating this news should be admonished first 
@TimesNow Did it take so many day for you to talk 
@IndianExpress Where is Biplab or like in any other non BJP state the Governor 
@ndtv How about hygiene pads and milk? Is getting governance out smarting the other or doing something for the nation.? 
@suhelseth @suchetadalal Suhel why don’t you think of similar ones for BJP Ministers and more so for Modi. Why not have the PMO in the aircraft itself. We can save on many expenses including Chai and Pakoda for his waiting staff. 
@BJP4India Hi BJP have you forgotten that you are in power and it is you who promised that all the black money in Swiss bank will be brought back and it is so much that every Indian will get 15 lakhs in his account. You guys are ultimate in comedy. 
@TimesNow @sambitswaraj What will happen to BJP does not have a Rahul to keep pitching themselves against. Why not try it with Manmohan Singh. The Chai and Pakoda will go licking if even one statement is made comparing Tugluk Modi to Manmohan Singh. 
@abpnewstv @arunjaitley @BJP4India Failed Minister and Acting Minister who is the finance Minister? 
@IndianExpress Why you assumed the same before 2014 
@BJP4India @rsprasad When will BJP ever talk one sentence independent of Rahul or Congress. Very sadly BJP has become a “me too” party with school boy projects and sensational barking media TRPs. Grow up and for Lord Ram sake govern atleast for the last 1 more year you have. 
@INCIndia Demonitization benefit to the Shah and surgical strike video Not surprising because BJP has confirmed that the general public are fools who can be fooled every time. 
@IndianExpress When will you remember that you are the CM of UP? 
@TimesNow @Sanju_Verma_ Spokes persons should draw a line from talking for the party and just yapping in paid national media. It is a disgrace for the nation to have such people relentlessly talking nonsense 
@ShekharGupta @SMHoaxSlayer @NikhilRampal1 Does this Postcard guy have a face and a name? Why he is not pulled for his relentless false propaganda. 
@ndtv Is this statement in the context of Advani, Joshi, Yeshwant? 
@TimesNow @RahulKothariBJP May Rahul in the name is the culprit 
@TimesNow Why should he be sacked? What is new in what he said? 
@Timesono @ Muxtstanwar @ RahulKothriBJP IT This Love Jihad 
@TimesNow I guess you were the one who stalled it when you were sitting as a permanent CM of Gujarat? You also told us that it will be over your dead body that GST will happen 
@IndianExpress How would you like to describe the monumental disaster demonetization? 
@dna @srawans You were just watching them is it? 
@ndtv Does this failed Minister that the economy is in ICU? 
@TimesNow @NishantStanwar Which community do they belong to? What is the gotta and did the idiot who organised this marriage ensure the suhag rath was also done? 
@IndianExpress What more is there to do. Any thing henceforth is only forward movement. What a mess you people have done to the economy 
@ArnabGosvvami @SushmaSwaraj It should be a relief for Sushma. Why don’t you unfollow a whole lot of people and enjoy your Bakthi Geet as a solo artist. 
@TimesNow What happened to the Cow. 
@sagarikaghose @INCIndia @BJP4India They are still counting and you are making an allegation which is against the people’s will and more so on the very sincere bank officials who worked over night to change. What made these restrictive bankers to work is of course a open secret 
@the_hindu Just to remind the central government who wishes to rule India directly or through alliance partners or through the Governor, that in TN it is a proxy government run by the Center and public wish for a BJP Governor’s Rule 
@TimesNow When will the nation do the same. Observe the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi as anti RSS day? November 8th as murder of economy day? 
@firstpost When are you going to withdraw from UP. The conditions are the same there too 
@dna If the problem is him how will he solve it? 
@sagarikaghose @BJP4India @INCIndia Why TN CM did not join the Modi bashing by the CM’s. Is united we stand divided we fall going to be tested in 2019 
@firstpost Why Lt Governor is not going to the public a la Bedi to say Kejriwal is not working and is corrupt just like Bedi is doing with Narayanswami? 
@abpnewstv What is happening? After Amit Shah’s personal meeting with Ramdev, such a statement is coming out. Is this Shah’s magical touch? Remember how much Shah worked for Yedi’s defeat in karnataka- Yedi is the most corrupt person statement made by Shah 
@rahulmishr56 @abpnewstv Brilliant keep up the good job. 
@sagarikaghose And the nation will pay for the greed of one man 
@abpnewstv Be happy they stopped with a tag. They should have banned these fringe groups 
@IndiaToday @sambitswaraj If you remove Rahul BJP is a big nothing. All these 4 years have ever slept without ragging him. More than congress BJP will be reduced to zero Some Shit Patra 
@abpnewstv Now can Rowdy Arnab cover this 
@TimesNow Why don’t we openly say we want the RSS trained and certified intellectuals in the government 
@Yatin_Salvekar @IndiaToday He never opens his mouth in India. Script, drama is way of life 
@Yatin_Salvekar @IndiaToday Just like the permission is sort from Nagpur HDK should seek approval.. simple. 
@IndiaToday Kumaraswamy May look to be unhealthy but don’t you think as a CM his priority is very clearly spelt out. Look at the development of the people and the state. Let Modi stop such drama. If he is really concerned tell him to send it to Gadkari, Amit Shah, Goa CM, FM, Sushma Swaraj 
@Showbiz_IT @IndiaToday Is there any post vacant? 
@htTweets Why don’t you elevate the cow itself? 
@TimesNow Shame on you TimesNow. Farmers suffer and you cover the BJP calling farmers failure. How much will your channel crawl for tainted money. For this you people can do prostitution 
@IndiaToday Very sad. The very job of a hacker is unethical. The crooks have designed ethical hackers and with that ethics goes out of the window. These morphing techies are the new age terrorist. With them the society will never get to see the truth. 
A strong politician who grew to become the President of India has disappointed the TV media and the social media. Their ramp up fell flat and the TRP might have nose dived. After all the nation is larger than individuals. 
@sardesairajdeep The address of Pranab was fair and was not leading to left or right. Yet the question he has left behind is there is a core value and principles which governs an individual. More so when you spend your entire life in a particular political party and now where are you 
@pbhushan1 @sagarikaghose We are expecting all Nehru family names to be replaced with Modi names. Don’t forget, Modi works for 10 hrs, is the only person who is thinking about India. Inface BJP should be renamed Modi party 
@INCIndia Where is that extra smart professor who abandoned India and went there to be purchased by BJP and ask some smart questions? Singapore BJP baktha group did not have money to buy him again or the setting has changed? Kya re setting aaa 
@IndiaToday When these idiots equate traitor Godse to Mahatma Gandhi it is no surprise that people like Some Shit Patra compares opposition to Hafiz. Idiots are obsessed with Pak and get orgasm when they sniff pak atleast once a day 
@TimesNow How long is this self pity story going to sell. 
@TimesNow Hope soon you search for security. 
@the_hindu Some time truth is bitter. 
@TimesNow May be gomutra will be ordered by the Monk who sold the Taj to be sprinkled all over this particular constituency 
@TimesNow @gauravbh Have you seen frog in a well? 
@IndiaToday @dpradhanbjp @sardesairajdeep Glad we now know who is the petroleum minister. Do these ministers ever perform or like their master have handed over their role to Nagpur and are on a road show business? 
@IndiaToday Why legal notice? Should you not be ashamed that you have lived up to the neo terminology Prestitute coined by your master BJP? 
@Tatanolive @Aranganathan 72 @Narendra Taneja @ Bjp4Dindi @Shansanjay @ Sansindia @ Saurabh 7678 @ Supriyashrinate Arrons 
After a media publicised committee reviewing fuel reduction, 
1 paisa reduction is announced 
When Hitler style is in action why not payback the German style. 
Stop the vehicles on the road for an hour. 
@sardesairajdeep Arrogance 
After a media publicised committee reviewing fuel reduction, 
1 paisa reduction is announced 
When Hitler style is in action why not payback the German style. 
Stop the vehicles on the road for an hour. 
Arrogance

Stop the vehicles on the road for an hour. 
@BJP4India While the few whom you call as ministers are already in the bed or on the way. We are also waiting for some real work to happen but 4 years have gone and you are yet to settled down from the thu thu formula of power. We are waiting 
@RahulGandhi More than anyone keep the Pakoda Man and his side kick Bonda informed else they will be forced to spin another jumla 
@timesofindia How is it that BJP takes a moral stand that corruption means it is others and not BJP? Be it love for the nation, love for the cow, love for the national anthem it is BJP. Is the media paid in full for this narrative. Why the cobra sting is silenced 
@CNNnews18 What are you going to do even if he has said so? He told give me 50 days else burn me after the monumental disaster of demonitization. Nothing happened. Na kavunga na kanedevunga sirf Ambani, adhani ko Sab kuch milega 
Sharad Pawar and PA Sangma neither you won nor the nation progressed. Could you have sorted out the power struggle in a much better way? 
What has these people got upon the nation. Open spat between Mani Shanakr Iyer and Suresh Kalmadi. Jayanthi Natarajan, Kamalnath, SM krishna. Are these people the main cause for all our misery? Power struggle or Individual is more important than the nation’s progress 
@IndiaToday Looks like there is a race to the finish line of 100 before 5 years of Modi Raj. Who will be first 5 years of Rs 100/ litter? 
@CNNnews18 Even Amit Shah can be trusted not this guy. Birds of same feathers Anna Hazare, Nitish, Anupam Kher 
@IndianExpress Is kidney functioning well 
@ndtv This guy is on a daily basis addressing the media. I am sure fear has set in and over communication is the main task in hand. 
@CNNnews18 We know you have I’ll reduce the fuel price by Rs 5/- before May 2019. After all you are facing the lectionary and all the money amassed n Ed’s to be used sometimes 
@sardesairajdeep You said it. Rajdeep. The narrative of the nation is decided by these TV anchors and look at the way journalism has deteriorated. Do they have any shame. 
@TimesNow @RShivshankar Why you guys are so bent on twisting everything as Modi vs. is it not a fact that apart from upper caste Hindus no one is safe and yet Shivshankar, having been purchased by BJP, don’t you feel ashamed to prostitute your profession? 
@TimesNow @thenewshour @navikakumar Navika where were you after the debacle of karnataka? Having done so much of vote canvassing even more than the actor, you must have been very disappointed right? 
@abpnewstv How? You guys have confirmed the common public to be fools is it? Having lost to a local congress leader called DKS, the s Kf proclaimed Shah feels very insulted that inspite of having the entire government missionary in his hand could do nothing to purchase even one MLA 
@ShekharGupta Such act will be done only by people who have some shame in them. Actually Vala did what was dictated to him. Let the guy who have this idea come out. The media will not dare to name him. 
@IndiaToday @mayuganapatye It is evident there is no safety for elected members in current form of India. 
@ashoswai Soon Kiran Bedi will join this idiot 
@Retributions Why Kedi is not there in Bangalore after the Cheap Minister was out on the Chair by the Gardner. 
@sumanthraman @RahulGandhi Why Kedi and the criminal were not there when the convict took charge as Cheap Minister today? 
@sagarikaghose @BSYBJP If the Pimps lose the floor test after 15 days the courts should slap the entire cost of elections on the Pimps 
@TimesNow Do they bother is all the fooled people le call them names. Pimps have no shame. They are there to rape the democracy 
@IndianExpress He does not have any shame for that matter his party is a shameless party 
@Abpanevsv @tholgandhi google search for fec? Tire? Jumbo 
@sagarikaghose He is 8th pass and others are 10 fail 
@ndtv Thank you for yet another brilliant piece of stupidity. 
@IndianExpress Then do they require any respect 
@htTweets Should Pimp be the right word 
@CNNnews18 @hd_kumaraswamy I wish all the 15 days the Governor who has given his master party BJP should be a nightmare for the arrogant and never in their life they should try to fool the constitution. Yeddi should surrender his purchased chair and run for ever. 
@IndiaToday @Iamtssudhir It is not source it is evident from day 1 Yeddi will have nightmare and Karnataka will have Muthuluks, Reddy Brothers, Hegde becoming the Ministers. Banana Republic will be witnessed we are already seeing it in the center. 
@TimesNow It is not hate group. It is fight against the pimps and prostitution of democracy. Sold out news channel doing your job of boot polishing perfectly 
@ANI Is there not even one person with spine in that group to handle such guys 
@TimesNow Pimps are on the proll. 
@waglenikhil When people have agreed to be fooled in every elections why there should be one rule for everyone? This is Banana Republic in full form. Else go to Pakistan 
@TimesNow Stones, tomatoes and eggs are ready 
@abpnewstv If you can purchase them nothing like it. Throw money on them and give them 100 cows 
@CNNnews18 Where were you all hen Goa, Manipur and Meghalaya was raped by BJP? 
@sagarikaghose @INCIndia @BJP4India Please send this to the unlettered Governor of Karnataka. If BJP purchases power in Karnataka then the common man should force BJP out of office in Goa, Manipur and Meghalaya. The prostitution of democracy has to stop and arrogant BJP put in place. 
@IndiaToday Modi has proved that he can fool all people all time and even if means 30% of the population it is an achievement 
@ndtv When you can sleep with anyone why not sleep with Deva Dowda? You slept in J&amp;K, Manipur, Meghalaya, Gujarat, Goa, is there one state where you have been honest. Shame on you 
@sagarikaghose Stone the MLA who is getting sold. Let the Governor be dragged to the Assembly and forced to sign as BJP CM for Karnataka. Shame on BJP. 
@sardesairajdeep You think these power hungry cheddi fellows will learn. If only the BJP Governor allows BJP to form government anarchy will set in. Banana republic has bloomed 
@sardesairajdeep Remember Goa, Meghalaya and Manipur BJP did not have the vote, seat, moral, constitutional right to sit in power and yet made it. Land mark judgement of SR Bommai on horse trading did not seem to have made them guilty. Now let’s see what the BJP Governor has to sing. 
@TimesNow @navikakumar Navika have you lost your nuts or what. What happened in Goa . Did your master not mock democracy? Remove the smirk in your BJP casting couches face and atleast now do proper news anchoring 
@TimesNow Are you going to eat humble pie Navika and Rahul Shivshankar? Boot polishing is making you spit and shine your masters boots 
@CNNnews18 Beg borrow or steal keep the liers out. Let the colours fade with the rains we need peace not lies, we need harmony not enemies, we need inclusive growth not one person. 
@livemint Mr Deva Gowda ensure you get the best deal. Who ever it is BJP or Congress. What has values and social commitment got to do with May 15th results. Else split your MLA’s and get them to join BJP as well as Congress 
@ShekharGupta @ShashiTharoor We have become a set of fools to be fooled by the brilliant BJP. Do we have a choice? 
@ndtv Twitter was found by a person not of this person’s religion can he please delete his account. Non of the social media is founded by his religious followers can he walk out please. 
@CNNnews18 Should the people not was the fringe act BJP boot polisher with acid to get his perversion back to normal track 
@dna Excuse me. BJP Vice President. What can we expect from you after your statement on Renuka. When did you last wear a pant. 
@TimesNow The common people will speak when the me comes. May be you will be able to speak at all 
@ndtv Now the bakth brigade will justify this act. Why even during Nehru days burning was done. Why Rahul is not able to stop this. Only Modi can. 
@IndianExpress Because he wants to talk something which is not a jumla. The Pakoda Man never refers to a slip because for him 600 cr people voted for BJP, Cholas built Shore temple, does it matter when fools are listening to him 
@Livimant is my smell 
@INCIndia We will achieve Booshi mukth Barath. 
@IndianExpress Good going. Soon India will be boodhi mukth Barath 
The supporters say it is done to drive them out. The council suspect the investigation. The defence lawyer fears for her life. The opposition says women and children are not safe. Ruling party says so many are raped every minute why politicise this rape. What have you to say? 
What is the bakthi for. What have you done for a section of the population to believe all is going to be fine. Is mocking and bullying a family the only credentials. Are we not seeing the nation divided. Are we going to disintegrate soon. Is this what we are guiding the nation to 
A child is raped every 20 minutes and the eroded moral value is so much that you do that act inside a temple. The lawyers association block the courts. Police men are invloved. The law makers are the prime accused. And the nation is divided on condemning this rape. Are we right 
A team is banned for 2 years for being involved in betting which is illegal. After 2 years you come back and the entire nation is celebrating. Marketing spend is huge and we celebrate a banned team. An indicator to the pulse of what the people want. It does not matter who. 
@abpnewstv Nobody killed Arushi. No one was murdered in 2002 riots. Nobody demolished Babri masjid and now no person planted the bomb at Mecca Masjid. What are we leading ourselves to? If this resignation has a force behind ache din aagaya. Hurray we are a Banana Republic 
@barandbench @suchetadalal @DefenceMinIndia Should this money not be paid by BJP party rather than from the government treasury 
@TimesNow @faizan_kidwai BJP knows only that. Else they will bully one Pappu. Have we ever heard any governance from them? 
@TimesNow @TheTanveerAhmed My religion has never in its history taken so much of beating and insult like this before. BJP is the sole culprit to have pulled my religion to the streets and made it a mockery. 
@TimesNow @GVLNRAO @faizan_kidwai We also have right to protect our religion from the hands of dogmatic frustrated religious fanatics. Stop claiming proprietary rights over Hinduism. 
@TimesNow @GVLNRAO What has this guy go to do in Karnataka when he is not able to do anything in his state? Is he being mentored to saffornise the country? 
@TimesNow @TheTanveerAhmed @GVLNRAO May be these guys will rewrite history and say Mahatma Godse was the greatest freedom fighter and Tipu Sultan was an understudy disowned by the Maha Sabha 
@IndiaToday @rajnathsingh Don’t you think such rapes are minor instances disturbing the nation image? Why don’t you ask Arun Jaitley about his opinion on this? 
@TimesNow Why not we ask the CBI to investigate his IAS results 
@IndianExpress Thank God this guy did not say his ministers supported because Nehru asked them to do so 
@IndiaToday @ashwini1959 BJP ministers were forced to resign and Mufti demanded their resignation. Rapist MLA of UP BJP was arrested under government directions. What happened to question paper leak? 
@timesofindia @MVenkaiahNaidu Are you still the Vice President of BJP or the Nation. Your comments are very obvious and you don’t seem to realise that you have moved up the ladder 
@ANI Go ahead and ask UN also why they did not open their mouth for rapes during UPA regime 
@IndianExpress Now is BJP going to ask did this person open his mouth when children were raped during congress regime ? 
@CNNnews18 @RahulGandhi @PrakashJavdekar You should also ask why Nehru or Indira or Rajiv also did not do a candle light march. Idiots what will you do if the congress names someone other than the Gandhi as PM candidate. So stuck is this party that they life is around Rahul. Are you so scared of your Pappu? 
@TimesNow And what should we build a temple and start erecting statues. Idiots 
@ANI Meenakshi Licking. The court ordered for the arrest and you had no choice but to send your MLA Purush behind luxury bars. Mufti stood by the woman in her and demanded the resignation of the rape of the religion hero’s now are waiting for their arrest if not stoning them to death 
@IndiaToday Lekhi you are lucky to have survived the press meet without a slipper being flung at you 
@TimesNow @navikakumar @thenewshour Navika I appreciate your faint diversion tonight? Cheap 
Rape the religion: how can the nation stand to see a set of lawyers and Elected members in Jammu defending the Rape and challenging the judiciary? Are we making any sense covering and giving these verbal Rapist the national attention. I feel like spitting on their face 
@IndiaToday Meenakshi Lekhi, we have a fundamental doubt. Can’t you people talk one sentences without a comparison. Are you saying this rape is less brutal than that rape. Are you a woman. Do you readout any crap given by your party. 
@TimesNow Is that what the nation wanted a change. Mindless ideology, goof up after goof ups. It is not just economic tinkering, it is cultural murder and making people believe we are growing. Of what use when there is cultural distortion, communal divide and mental hatred 
@EconomicTimes BJP can pay this amount after all they are the richest and may be soon richer than the country 
@ShekharGupta @BhardwajAnanya And the nation is listening and scared of this Rapist. Is the nation a set of incompetent people who will accept such brutality. 
@IndianExpress If this question was asked to you guys you will have to pay back since 2010. 
@IndianExpress Why are you not able to run the parliament even after brutal majority. Don’t divert shameless rapists. Get up and start working before the crowd start pelting stone and eggs on you. 
@TimesNow And you will find him to n the drama of fast today. Common man can you show what it means when it come to this level. 
@CNNnews18 @qazifarazahmad This guy will because me a Governor soon. 
@ANI Good job. 
@IndianExpress Can they be on fast unto death. There will be a relief to the nation 
@ANINewsUP @ANI Shameful UP Govt and a bunch of chamchas. I am sure there is no harm if people spits on their face for such a statement. 
@rupasubramanya @BDUTT Where are the so called social activists. Do they spring up only if there is a BJP agenda to it. Can’t we force this Rapist Govt to atleast take action on the Rapist? 
@IndiaToday Feel like spitting on his face 
@timesofindia @narendramodi We are waiting for your day long action and comedy. 
@aartic02 @TimeTideRide And the Actor is going my on hunger fast tomorrow not for this but they are drunk with arrogance and power. 
@yadavtejashwi @TimeTideRide Boss when 600 crs voted for BJP and 176lakh crores has s true why not this small number that too toilets 
@sagarikaghose @TimeTideRide all should have answered yes their parents are part of BJP 
@sagarikaghose @TimeTideRide More than liking it retweeting it this tweet from Sagarika needs to be read with deep sense of hurt. See how much of damage caste has  done to the real human in those fanatics 
@ashoswai @TimeTideRide @TimesNow @navikakumar Navika will be out beating Rowdy Arnab. She turns out to be a total sold out BJP spokesperson. It is an honour for her to be called a true Prestitute- a term her masters coined. 
@TimesNow Will BJP apologise for their gross misuse of public privacy. 
@abpnewstv Should civilians takeover from this Rapist BJP government inefficiency. Is BJP buying time by diverting a useless hunger fast so that they arrest the BJP Rapist MLA in BJP terms and not under pressure from common man 
@TimesNow Why can’t Chotta Modi or IPL Modi buy AI 
@ShekharGupta @BhardwajAnanya Can’t we even take him to custody after so much of misdeed? Is the nation becoming a bunch of historical goons who decide our nation’s safety 
@ShujaUH Hi if they have called out Bharat Mara... then they are absolved of any crime. Break their bones for shaming the nation and like a mad cap using the nation’s name at wrong places. 
@ShekharGupta @RuhiTewari Does it matter if the dummy MPs buy what he Monarch dictates 
@TimesNow His job is only to dramabazee so what is new. As if others were doing drama while on fast. Tomorrow unusually he will sign file after file before the camera and Navika will go ga ga about the only and the first PM to do so. 
@svaradarajan @thewire_in They are an honest party. Why so much cannot be earned. See Jay Shah he proved he can do it. 
@TimesNow One point lesson Throw stones before anyone else does so that the onlookers will wonder what is happening. By the time they understand elections will be over. 
@TimesNow @GVLNRAO Joke. 
@TimesNow @GVLNRAO Rowdy party, Rapist party, coward party talking about opposition. Shame on you. We are waiting for you guys to go on a fast unto death. We will ensure we support you till your last breadth 
@TimesNow @navikakumar Have you ever asked if this person ever bothered to sit in the parliament leave alone run it. Navika you are a sold out journalist and shame on you to anchor a BJP party news channel under a general category 
@ndtv Please we are waiting for fast unto death. We will support you till your last breadth 
@IndianExpress Guess Bedi should appoint her own CM and run a parallel government. 
@TimesNow Ask the BJP for an explanation for Sivakumar raid during Ahmed Patel victory inspite of the BJP Ministers running around like headless chickens 
@TimesNow @GVLNRAO Good joke. You need to have done some work to talk about it and debate on it. Your 4 Yrs is only drama, melodrama, and lies. Please go on fast unto death we will support you till your end comes. 
@ANI We want to see you people do it quite often. The nation will save some grains for the poor. 
@NakulShenoy @calamur Let us see if the paid media captures these desh Bakthas starting fast straight from bed or will have breakfast and then start. April 12th Arnab, Navika we are waiting 
@sagarikaghose Are you sure the Home Minister wanted states and UT to BEEF up? 
@htTweets Hee Hee. BJP talking about Police being used by the ruling party. It is very glaring right. 
@IndianExpress Please can you give a guideline. Should it be fine if fasting starts 2 days before and closes 2 days after. There is a limit to be biased. 
@CNNnews18 Speech full of gas. 
@ndtv @sambitswaraj Idiots the feast is before the fast. So what the fast is to insult BJP and not self suffering. Be happy they did not have beef curry. 
@TimesNow Idiots you have said before the fast and not during the fast. You were paid to do negative campaign on congress and not goof up like this. Paid prostitution in journalism fits you guys well. 
@timesofindia @TOICitiesNews Don’t allow this guy to be in our community. 
@calamur We also do not trust you idiot. How can this guy call himself a MLA after such statement. High time the constituency asks for his resignation 
As we enter our 10th year of consulting, we thank all our clients, their employees and team BuildHr for this enriching journey focused on the Family Managed Businesses &amp; Start Up's. https://t.co/aG5crdW6lp 
@sagarikaghose You said it. All for the silver coins. Yeh duniya yeh darthi. 
@sagarikaghose @TOICitiesNews Is this what the nation wanted after 4 years of voting an ideology that is antithesis to harmony 
Is social media making you think what it is influencing you to think a particular way. Would you normally accept the making of a hero from the drunken drive-killing of pavement dwellers- blackbuck shooting and 5 years term after 20 years and token 2 days jail? 
A team which is not a gentleman in a gentleman game is found guilty suspended for 2 years and its master pinned for not being straight. Now marketing and changing the narrative makes CSK a team to follow. Am I in the right side of thought 
You kill with your drunken driving and behave erratic and finally you are handed over 5 years jail for killing an animal not humans. Is it a way of influencing public the way we think. 5 years for killing an animal? Oh how harsh. God say us the way we think. 
What an irony a person who dodge for 20 years and after a token 2 days in jail gets bail and get a hero’s welcome. A team which is caught cheating after 2 years suspension is celebrated. Are we in the right path? 
@visharjan @EconomicTimes Who the miracle man jay Shah? 
@KarunagaranMun @EconomicTimes Yes I am waiting to see what the Monarch has done for all the cacophony I hear he has not taken leave, he sleeps for only 4 hrs let him first do something independent of Pappu leave along congi 
@timesofindia @TOIMumbai When it is Indrani then media needs to focus because it is a first time in history an accused from nowhere helps BJP to pin down PC a former finance, Home, commerce minister. A criminal is more trust worthy than a person who guarded the nation. 
@ndtv Atleast after 4 years these people have picked up guts  to question the Monarch. If only they had asked questions when demonitization, hasty GST, one person multiple ministry, beef per chercha, national anthem drama in theatre, their part would have been much better 
@CNNnews18 Her job is done. From no where she was used to hit PC and his son Karthi. Fist time an accused is more trust worth than the country’s former finance, Home, commerce minister. Now she is likely to get alternate avenue to move out of jail. 
@EconomicTimes This guy is now licking the feet of the people whom their party shunned all of the 4 years. One guy disowns his religion and says he is not a Jain and another embraces backward community after they have realised ye sub kuch gol mal hai.. BJP ka gol mal hai. 
@ShekharGupta There are a very few journalist who stand by your profession. You are one of them. Request you to ensure there is no emotional melodrama this Actor is allowed to play and the media truncates it beyond proportion 
@TimesNow Drama started. Camera on..... next one year rolllllling sirrrrrrr 
@sagarikaghose Bai it took 4 years for you to realise that it was all Gol mal hai subkuch gol mal hai bai. 
@TimesNow You get away for killing of pavement dwellers, get a 5 year term for killing an animal and after 2 days in jail get bail. Now all are happy, whom are we kidding? 
@TimesNow Don’t you think these ministers should be pulled up for lying. Till yesterday they told it was maintenance shut down and storage space and today they say it is hacked. Whom are they thinking we common people are ? 
@abpnewstv First be a human being then others. Did you not know Jains are the funders and their votes are large numbers. 
@dna I think instead of paying the opposition The Shah paid himself to talk like what he is doing now. 
@ANINewsUP @ANI Why don’t you say the photograph was taken when Nehru was the PM, now everything is fine and In fact there are no old age people in Agra? 
@ndtv When you try to over do something it will hit you back and you won’t know what hit you. The hit will be at the most unexpected time. 
@IndiaToday The start of the FY 2018 all seems not good for the holy party. May be sani Bhagwan is playing it’s leelaigal 
@IndianExpress Those who assassinated the father of the nation talking about freedom of expression. Does this not sound better BJP defence minister. 
@EconomicTimes @AnanthKumar_BJP So you did not serve the people. You deliberately avoided parliament session and when Sachin paid back his salary guilt atleast reached your heart. 
@ndtv @bainjal It is even fine to join the BJP but this guy Nitish should be an untouchable in politics that history should teach a lesson to such opportunist. He is the first point of lesson : you may be intelligent but it does not mean others are fools. 
@IndianExpress Is it the timing that our person is worried or the directive itself. Should the press not clamp on the monarch. 
@IndianExpress This withdrawal is not victory it requires demand for resignation and no confidence motion. Congress you are too soft and decent to handle these rogues. 
@TimesNow @SudhanshuTrived Is this fake news or real. Now every news should have an aadhaar card type of authentication 
@sagarikaghose Anything which is going to undo the 4 years of jumla is defined as fake and anyone reporting it will be reporters of fake news. The nation’s Bahu has been given the task to enact a drama and see if people are still ready to be fooled. Else we will find other means to fool. 
@IndianExpress We will not allow anyone else to take the nation backward. We are there and will ensure we will do it. Decoding the Shah. 
@ShekharGupta Of course it should. How do you think BJP and Modi will survive next one year if every statement is going to be undone. False is false only if false is certified as false by the leaders of false 
@sagarikaghose @BJP4India @INCIndia Don’t you think all these started in the last 4 years. 
@svaradarajan @rohini_sgh @thewire_in We have started to see what experience of 70 years can do to the Bacchus. Now fun has started next one year BJP Ministers are going to have a night mare. 
@IndianExpress Glad he did not say people who wear an underwear will be impotent. 
@priyankac19 We want the ministers to be embedded with RFID so that we can track how they are making indecent proposals and casting couches. Doordarshan has to make it live for the voters to know what they are up to. Can we start this with the nation’s Bahu? 
@IndianExpress Because you are doing what the party wants and not what the nation wants 
@ShekharGupta @AmritaNayak3 How about the same RFID card on the Ministers. Many will be caught making indecent proposals and casting couches. 
@IndianExpress Things have started really going right for the nation now. The Shah Freudian slips and now the Noida police. Happy for the nation 
@sardesairajdeep Why should not th media go after such people le and expose them and ncluding who funded them. 
@ShekharGupta Rowdy Arnab and BJP Times Now will be the first to lose their licence. BJP will be the biggest loser 
@the_hindu But he has to be in the country for covering him. He has to discuss  for his voice to be heard in the parliament. He has to work apart from talking for people to be interested in his monologue 
@TimesNow @GVLNRAO Do they have any shame? Having successfully fooled most of the people, you have the arrogance to say oil is cheap. What is the price of crude and what is petrol price in India? 
@IndianExpress He missed the last part..... by others. 
BJP assessing why Nehru is the person who leaked the CBSE question papers. It cannot be Pappu because according to Susu samy, Pappu did not write any exams 
The political out witting is going to screw up the data analytic industry. The saffron slip is out for you all. 1.76 lakh crore Vinod Rai raped the telecom industry.Chotta Modi gave a push to the vultures to ask for privatisation of Banks.13 lakh NCC data gift to the Yap 
@bsindia How these cows linked their mobile number to Aadhaar? 
@PChidambaram_IN May be it is the first time you have paid for your tea. We have been ripped for some ages now. 
@bsindia Are you asking this question to your Boss who opposed Aadhar until 2014? 
@svaradarajan @thewire_in Best is to scrap RTI. 
@EconomicTimes @BJP4India You are a gift to our society. Please preserve him and keep him in the museum. Let history know India had a troubled period starting from 2014. God knows when this will end. 
@htTweets @alphonstourism And you are incharge of Tourism. Either your stars are good or we need to go through such things. Our fate. 
@IndianExpress The day you privatise bank it will be the same story as petrol prices. It is a conspiracy using Chotta Modi as an example. Banks privatisation is harmful for the poor and upcoming industries. 
@BJP4India @AmitShah Are you serious about parliamentary democracy? You can talk when others don’t have the mike. Can you debate rather than monologues. 
@IndiaToday @SwetaSinghAT Won’t be surprised if Pakoda Party buys out even Siddu. 
@TimesNow Why are you asking constipated Babu. Pakoda Party is bag of confusing and diversion. Guy who is least responsible will answer for the nation’s important questions. They think the nation is made up of fools even more after we keep voting for them. 
@TimesNow @navikakumar @thenewshour Navika and team go back to school. Journalism is not bootlicking. Suggest you do a show with Pranoy Ray and his NDTV and learn how to be on media. Don’t forget to take Rowdy Arnab with you 
@TimesNow @navikakumar @thenewshour Look at the blatant superlatives used. Sitting CM seat is lost and BJP TimesNow skirts it and now BJP loses all contested seats but for one and BJP TimesNow celebrates. Shame on your biased journalism 
@IndianExpress Is  his not criminal 
@IndianExpress But your master will lose the 2019 elections if you play your role honestly. 
@ANI Hee Hee Heee. See how angry my Information Minister is. He did not know this social media AI is working better than the Bakthi team. 
@TimesNow @Swamy39 Hee Hee when other play your card it is very hard to digest. Please remember when big boys start playing they really play. You people are still in cheddi remember that. 
@livemint What is wrong. Why only BJP can play divisive politics is it? The people want it and the people elected government as a servant of the people has approved it. Jai Hind. 
@TimesNow @RShivshankar Aadhaar was rejected in 2014 and approved in May 2014. BJP TimesNow did you get the letter or you have forgotten that you are a news channel and not BJP channel. 
@TimesNow Where was this guy when Pakoda Party came with holier than Cow politics 
@TimesNow @RShivshankar How is it that only BJP TimesNow and Rowdy Arnab only get such leaked letters. Are these BJP spokesmen or journalists. They should be conferred titles of Pimps rather than Prestitute. 
@dna On the way to Privatisation ? 
@TimesNow @Shehzad_Ind NE you did not win. A Pimp was purchased and everywhere in NE it is not a mandate for Pakoda. 2 seat party forming a government is a shame on democracy 
@NatarajaMurthi @kschib1961 @TimesNow @madhavgk @rg @narendramodi We the nation and all Hindus including other fellow religion members are happy and peaceful. I don’t know what you drink but this cover agent  employment of yours will not last take care. Pakoda team may not need you soon. 
@BJP4India Yes only 1% are doing banking others have nothing left. Keep it up 
@NatarajaMurthi @kschib1961 @TimesNow @madhavgk @rg @narendramodi Faceless baktha learn to write first it is not locate. Of course you will not know when you are still at A for....B for....C for..... 
@NatarajaMurthi @kschib1961 @TimesNow @madhavgk @rg @narendramodi Where did you get 180 crs in 4 years to build your Pakoda office 
@kschib1961 @NatarajaMurthi @TimesNow @madhavgk @rg @narendramodi Jail Bird Yedi is the face of Pakoda Party in Karnataka. This speaks all. What will be the narrative if Pakoda had no Pappu to refer 
@TimesNow BJP Times Now looks like you are a dumb channel losing your plot. Give back the money you were paid for licking the boot 
@kschib1961 @NatarajaMurthi @TimesNow @madhavgk BJP Times Now are you not ashamed to show a video may be taken during testing and mentioning so. Did you see the crowd today. May be you were at Nirmala BJP defence minister running commentary 
@kschib1961 @NatarajaMurthi @TimesNow @madhavgk Why is it that all Bakthas and proud to mention followed by failed Ministers are faceless? 
@IndianExpress Yogi’s is the best Govt. What a benchmark the Pakoda Party has. 
@ShekharGupta @Rohini_Swamy A shame to the nation. People like Muthulak needs social treatment. Surprising that all turned hostile and nothing could be done as per law to the national Ikon of Shame. 
@kschib1961 @TimesNow @madhavgk What took 70 years for congress to loot is done by Pakoda Party in 4 years. Jay Shah, Chotta Modi, IPL Modi, Raffel Ambani, Road contract Gadha Kari, Twitter Swaraj, do you want some more looters from Pakoda Man team 
@kschib1961 @TimesNow @madhavgk Pakoda Party uses social media well with paid Bakthas 
@IndianExpress Are you saying polls will not happen again or you will not forget to rig the polls hereafter. 
@TimesNow @madhavgk BJP TimesNow are you funded by BJP and your job is to lick the boots. You need to learn journalism from Pranoy Roy. 
@TimesNow Very good call. When the nation can be divided on Cow why not no Dravidian politics 
@TimesNow @GVLNRAO I always wonder who this GVLNRAO is. This guy talks through his hat making no sense to himself leave alone to others. He has a pair Some Shit Patra. 
@TimesNow Should it not be Pakoda Modi if the other is kichidi party. Then what will you call the Meghalaya government Pimped government? Navika please grow up from this BJP TimesNow journalism to some basic level of not excellence 
@IndiaToday Tell him India has become one after Tugluk won. How such idiots are allowed to talk and get away. High time the people in the meeting or media themselves throw slippers or rotten egg on his face. 
@NavenduSingh_ You know why? Nehru’s constitution was lost by Congress. What an idiot of a news anchor this Rowdy has turned out to be. 
@bsindia Even now it is not too late. As RBI Governor you can put your foot down and reverse certain Tugluk decisions else resign. 
@bsindia Even if is talking against another cultural distorted, this Guy, Muthulak, Sakshi Maharaj, Yogi all deserve to be isolated and treated as a social untouchable 
@IndiaToday @sambitswaraj What is the Bihar, J&amp;K tie up called then is  it sleeping with an enemy? 
@svaradarajan @SriSri @khanumarfa Why not arrest this self proclaimed BJP agenda pusher? We are seeking no more Pimps surfacing. 
@ShekharGupta @anshumanscribe You forgot the Pimp of NE who attained nirvana. 
https://t.co/Z8K7HrgxHd 
@TimesNow @thenewshour @AnchorAnandN Can this news run in BJP TimesNow till karnataka elections? 
@TimesNow @AnchorAnandN @thenewshour BJP TimesNow have you forgotten the golden statement of Jaitley. “Running the parliament is the job of government. If they are incapable ask them to resign.” Any doubt ask the guy who has lost elections and screwing the nation. 
@IndianExpress He has joine BJP that’s it. 
Hence forth I will identify myself with the Aadhaar no. All sms, mail and phone call smothering with request can go and up theirs. 
@sardesairajdeep @IndiaToday Pimping in politics has become the order of the day. 
@IndianExpress Shameless politician. These are the Pimps in politics 
@htTweets @rammadhavbjp @prashantktm We continue to have these guys ranting and getting away. 
@bsindia If you are not nominated who else will. You have dedicated a channel 24/7 chanting and rewriting history. 
@EconomicTimes @rsprasad Was Aadhar not the biggest scam ore 2014. 
@TimesNow Navika who is this guy. Is he your driver or yet another paid artist. Your channel seems to be jobless and trying hard to divert the ally mukth BJP 
Let us all cherish the woman in all of us. The characteristics of a woman is grace, balanced, compassion, giving, care, doer. It is nice to celebrate the good. Happy women’s day. 
@IndianExpress Either congress was correct then and BJP gave false promise to capture power or BJP is following what Congress did then. 
@IndianExpress Good prediction. Even otherwise India is heading towards a civil war. Idiot of the first order. 
@sardesairajdeep And we have an idiot in TN calling himself a BJP leader feeling happy for what is happening to Lenin statue He tops it with Periyar. Waiting for a garland of slipper to be on him and non BJP media covering it. 
@TimesNow Your hands are full. Sleeping with an enemy is showing even before you pull your pants down. I doubt if the casting couches will serve your purpose. 
@IndianExpress These Pakoda guys have not even officially taken over. Ache din for banana republic. 
@IndianExpress @OfficeOfRG A Guy who was purchased did a perfect pimp’s job that even a 2 seat party can caste a couch. Now the people of Meghalaya will take care. 
@ramindersays @calamur What is seen is in the mind. I guess what was seen in 1980 was the message and now what is seen is the lady. Who makes you see is important than what you want to see. 
@ANI Sad to see democracy being raped by such perverts 
@IndiaToday @himantabiswa It should be did not think NE people could be purchased. 
@IndiaToday @_YogendraYadav Tripura was lost by the left because of their dogmatic ideology. Prakash Karat out voting Sitaram Yechuri to join hands with congress has wounded left badly. Actually congress played it for left yet the left lost to the mighty money power. 
@livemint It is given that HAL was looked down for the benefit of Anil Ambani’s maiden venture in Aerospace. 
The left lost Tripura and it was not congress. Nagaland has voted out BJP clearly and Meghalaya has been retained as a single largest party by congress. Now the purchase of power is going to happen in Meghalaya and Nagaland. 
@IndianExpress Have you already decided TN, Kerala, Telangana have been purchased. 
BJP Republic is praising Himanta who has after all been purchased by BJP 
Navika shame on you to change your stands as BJP gains 
Look at the gain of confidence and the slow aggressive language the BJP TimesNow after the change in trends in Tripura 
I have faith on Money power. BJP can still form government in all the 3 
All the exit polls published by the BJP channels are now releasing their plan B narrative 
GVn says they are in power in their own capacity. How by purchasing the government? 
BJP TimesNow is building the narrative. What congress will say for BJP loss 
I am confident BJP will buy out the governments in Nagaland, Meghalaya and Tripura. 
Purchase officers of BJP pack their bags to the NE 
@svaradarajan @AmitShah @arunjaitley In this 4 years a degree could be shown. Good. 
@CNNnews18 @bhupendrachaube Will Kasab’s statement accusing UPA also surface. We are not going to be surprised. 
@Indian_to 30 @Timsono also know the pain 
@indian_2030 @TimesNow Why Jay Shah P&amp;L has some unknown nameless Bakthas jumping. 
When it comes to Answering a specific question, the Bakthas get into action and upload various details  on congress. What happened to suspended judgement of  Babri and on Advani? 
@dptheca @TimesNow Candy 
Till 2014 all act of corruption had to be blamed on the politicians. But after 2014 corruption is because of the bureaucrats.  BJP is beyond corruption. Yes. Ask Indirani she will confirm 
@IndiaToday @narendrataneja Should we laugh for this statement 
@TimesNow @Swamy39 Ho If Indrani has names PC then we need not go through the trial. Actually Arnab is the final authority anyway we can go by her holy Indrani’s reverence 
@TimesNow @Swamy39 When will Amit Shah be tried. Any dates please 
@TimesNow Will Kasab also be heard 
@TimesNow @RShivshankar The angel Indrani become the First Lady for BJP 
@TimesNow @RShivshankar Thank God BJP TimesNow did not name Nehru as part of the holy Indrani story 
@TimesNow @RShivshankar How is this news getting leaked through BJP TomesNow channel now 
@TimesNow @RShivshankar How did BJP TimesNow get to talk to Indrani 
@IndianExpress Does it really matter if the Govt of Goa falls. A set of elected legislators who went for a price and today are limping is expected. A lesson for the voters and democracy has to over come these cheapskate. 
@IndianExpress Let these great statements be captured. NCERT and UGC will have to document this and bring it as syllabus for schools and Colleges. I am proud to be part of this great genius era. 
@TimesNow Why does he not resign or remove the minister on moral high grounds. 
Rowdy Arnab the only channel which is doing sensational barking on Sridevi’s death. Cheap fellow. 
@TimesNow @tuhins Where is the high moral ground CM 
@IndianExpress Look who is talking 
@ndtv Can you talk anything else which will take the nation forward. It is sic and honestly boring 
@bsindia This itself needs a detailed enquirer. When it is claimed demonetization was top secret how this money was deposited? 
@IndianExpress Pakoda Man must be having nightmares because of the Nehru family. All combination of comparisons are done. 70 years, 60 years, now 48 years. Has become a joker. 
@TimesNow In 4 years the nation has been pushed to anarchism and by 2019 we will see Banana Republic 
@IndiaToday Baba what happened? Are you alright 
@TimesNow @navikakumar @thenewshour Can we consider Times Now as a news channel or Bakthi Channel. 
@abpnewstv @myogiadityanath Why this yogi talks about all other things but about his UP. 
@IndianExpress The most important job of the SC to hear this case. 
@ANI Nominate him for Padma award. 
@the_hindu Don’t wear under wear too 
@IndianExpress Vij should be announced as a monumental piece. 
@kitsharma @kaul_vivek @bainjal @beyondwhelm @sanjayuvacha @BalakrishnanR @ChandrusWeb @priyankac19 @tragicosmicomic @mitalisaran Agreed. Demonitization is a Tugluk act. Geetanjali was in business more so as surplus cash business. With multiple attack’s on the economy many Chotta Modi will fall. 
@abpnewstv Nirav Modi where is your brother who is also a partner. For clarity the brother who has married the sister of Ambani brothers. 
@abpnewstv Both are angry that this loot did not reach 1.76 lakh crores 
@TimesNow Raffle scam please. The borders are under threat can we hear on that from you. 
@BJP4India No wonder the women bill is not passed. With such stupidity in linking building rent and fraud on the bank, the Indian women will continue to suffer. Grow up Pakoda Party grow up 
@TimesNow @AnchorAnandN Gujathi takes loan pays till the central Govt changes. Gains confidence aided with demonitization sweep of the business, Chotta Modi is escorted to safe havens. 
@IndianExpress There is a difference between verbal diarrhoea and talking with content. Hope the speaker understands  his. 
@ndtv No wonder the women reservation bill is not passed. With such cheap politics and highest office Ministers talking like this women in India will continue to suffer. 
@TimesNow @navikakumar @thenewshour Chotta Modi is from Gujarat. He gets loans and has been out of Red till the Govt changes. Within 4 years he changes colour and before 2019 runs away. Are we smelling something rather than sniffing how to link UPA. 
@TimesNow @GVLNRAO Was the Govt appointed Director sleeping all these years. Least he could have done is write a book and invite BJP leaders to release the book. All such spineless Directors are as good as purchasable commodity 
@bhupendrachaube That’s fantastic news. Vinod Rai is there in this too? I think Rai will touch only if the number is big. 
@abpnewstv How shameless can you people be? Any goof up BJP converts it as Congress ne kia. Feel like spitting on the face for such Pakoda statements. 
@TimesNow @Shehzad_Ind Keep searching. As far as you Pakoda guys don’t realise that your ideology is dividing India you will keep facing many such Chotta Modi. 
@ETNOWlive @SupriyaShrinate @pbhushan1 @HemindraHazari @priyankac19 @INCIndia @OfficeOfRG @narendramodi @hiteshjain33 Actually BJP should start with Indira Gandhi because she nationalised the bank and then the Gandhi’s for being at helm of affairs for 30 years and then Congress for building the economy and then Pappu for becoming the President. Why Modi? 
@bhupendrachaube What happens if BJP government is toppled because of this scam and 10 years later Chotta Modi proves there is Zero loss? The damage is done right. Don’t lick the boot out eight 
@TimesNow @RShivshankar Is Times Now a channel out right to protect the image of BJP and Modi or purpose is to report news. A sold out channel. Name yourself Times Now a unit of BJP. Suits you well. 
@TimesNow @RShivshankar Is journalism done to dogs? When you write headlines are you looking for political appeasement or diverting issues from the real? 
@timesofindia Pakoda government can only make such statements. Chotta Modi is hurting you more than Pappu. 
@sagarikaghose Soon we will have the paid netizens coming out with a narrative that it is photoshop and it was not chotta Modi. 
@TimesNow Divert from chotta Modi to Vadra. You people should do prostitution rather than journalism 
@abpnewstv @rsprasad Some brilliant narrative that this happened in 2011 whom to blame. All the growth story happened in 4 years and this happened in 2011? What a Pakoda narrative. Keep it up. 
@abpnewstv @rsprasad It hurts right? Did you not think the same when Nehru, MK Gandhi, Manmohan Singh was called names by the Pakoda Master. 
@abpnewstv I have began to fear what is going to happen to our nation. 
@IndianExpress It ok, Jait lie will not know what he is talking for he knows nothing that happens in his ministry 
@TimesNow @sambitswaraj Don’t you people come out with one original work. For not telling the cost of purchase you needed a week to dig out Congress references. So if do not have a reference what will you Pakoda guys do? 
@firstpost Yeddi remember you are out on bail. It is we should be allowing you and not the other way. 
@TimesNow @navikakumar When are you going to run a slot on the sexist comment by the Pakoda Man and his side kick who has climbed the chair with his sheer bakthi 
@dna He does not comprehend logic and reasoning. 
@Ram_Guha History will never forgive these Pakoda and Chai politics. These two will go any extent to grab power. 
De Schill India Pacoda quo ... talk nonsense Talk tea drink 
@abpnewstv @narendramodi New is over now new karnataka. 
@bsindia Did we ask this question during 2014 election campaign. 15 lakhs, smart city, Sardar patel statue. 
@sardesairajdeep Are we as a nation getting mislead. All of a sudden the people have become spineless including so called business leaders. What a mess this religious feeling can do to our leaders. 
@ndtv Excellent, go ahead and kill Goa. Make wearing saffron underwear and bikini compulsory 
@sardesairajdeep @arunjaitley @PMOIndia @IndiaToday Actor kick starts 2019 election campaign. 
On this martyr day the sacrifice of our Mahatma to be remembered. The narrow minded Sung in what ever avatar they are now should be admonished. Hope our leaders don’t line up before  Godse’s statute and distribute sweets. 
@TimesNow @AnchorAnandN The more BJP under mines the constitution you will have many such equally irresponsible statements. Don’t forget the left can do anything 
@CNNnews18 The issues is the senior SC judges feel there is a bias in allotment of cases to SC bench by the CJI. Particularly on Justice Loya death. Why BJP is playing smart by diverting it as BJP vs Cong. Are they seeing awakening of democracy 
@abpnewstv @sambitswaraj Paid channel of BJP republic with Rowdy Arnab advocating for BJP no one is ready to believe that the government is innocent 
Rowdy Arnab get his chamchas and keep barking and others eat biscuits and go home abused 
@the_hindu Is it because our PM does not know to dramatise in English? 
@INCIndia Is he giving to Pak or China. Is he the nation’s minister or a business man 
@htTweets @rsprasad Were you sleeping 4 years back 
@TimesNow Why is Modi dumb on all the rant 
@dna When will BJP lack of governance be exposed if at all 
@sardesairajdeep Do these people have any ideology. Are we they just playing school buy politics 
@Me1Incredible @iammanishms @IndiaToday @sardesairajdeep @sambitswaraj While Rowdy Arnab can become the BJP minister and zee can become the dordharsan and JIO the BSNL. 
@firstpost After spending the entire budget and campaign for a month the EC with its tail between its legs announces election dates. The PM goes on duty and spends his time in Gujarat. Now Shah wants to know 
If only the media was not judgemental and did not canvas for the BJP, I am sure the results would have been different 
@ArvindKejriwal Why the Governors of BJP ruled states are not performing as per their right given in the constitution as quoted by BJP stalwarts. Are such governors sleeping or do not know the constitution 
Programme on performance assessment 13-14-12-2017 https://t.co/E7dQap6P6t 
@suresh_lal @TimesNow Exactly the only things you have missed out feku a ka Tugluk 
@TimesNow Pappu and Yuvaraj cat calling is fun and normal but chai wala and feku is disturbing. 
@htTweets Glad people are matching those who have captured power by any means. The nation is progressing with provocative speeches and rewards for cutting nose, head, finger, throats. Ache Din 
@sardesairajdeep Actually the sold out journalists headed by Arnab, navika, Anand, zee TV, news X, have come together. 
@ndtv What happened to Lokpal. Idiot you were paid to distribute the rhythm of the nation. You did it and got paid. You should have the CBI at your door steps first 
@ndtv People like him are more dangerous than the religious fanatics 
@ndtv The agent has come back 
@IndiaToday Does this mean anything. The Monk does not like a particular section. Period. 
@sardesairajdeep Soon use of the word chai is going to be a taboo and law enacted for minimum 3 yrs jail. 
Join Yogita and Me for a workshop on Performance Assessment &amp; Management System https://t.co/xPUW16JClN 
@IndiaToday @RakeshSinha01 For making such a statement Rakesh Sinha should be charged with sedation. 
@ndtv @sagarikaghose @LRC_NDTV Concern is cost. Did you ever think of the cost when the brilliant idea of demonitization came to you. 
@ndtv @sagarikaghose @LRC_NDTV One time poll and one time lie. This is an easy move to make our country a dictator and destroy the constitution 
@sardesairajdeep After 3 years we have some serious discussion on economy. Thanks to the Trojan Sinha 
@bhupendrachaube Bhupen joins the Arnab group of prostitution of journalism. Please stop this hypocrisy 
@bhupendrachaube Do you think MMS was not from the institution of Indian PM 
@bhupendrachaube Were you part of some other job before May 2014 or you have been paid to make this chamcha statement 
@bhupendrachaube This institution of Indian PM existed even before Modi took over in May 2014. 
@I_DIVYANSHU @INCIndia GST, Aadhaar card, NEET for that matter BJP was insane all these years. A classic Tugluk we are seeing 
@par_des @BJP4India @AmitShah Have US citizens been given voting rights for Indian elections. This is your Bahu interpretation not mine 
@SandeeP__Vns @BJP4India @AmitShah One guy ran the Indian elections from there do you know that or have you forgotten 
@BJP4India @AmitShah Is that the reason 6 visits in 3 years and there are no country the Tugluk has not visited 
@Taimur90293971 @sardesairajdeep Don't you think all of it are BJP infused drama 
@timesofindia Glad Aadhaar is find its relevance by the same set of people who broadcasted that it was waste of public money until 2014 
@htTweets @AmitShah @prashantktm Why the media goes out of the way to shower praises on someone who is outdoing goondaism. Are you people paid to sing praise more than it is 
@BJP4India Republic 
@ShekharGupta Is this out rage because the Chinese premier did not meet the showman of India 
@sardesairajdeep Why not get sena and Sambit Patra on your show and just focus on the difference between capital punishment and cheap politics. 
@sardesairajdeep @SirPareshRawal Rajdeep the baktha brigade have ready questions... what happened for 70 yrs. Unfortunate the reality is we are heading no where 
@priyajitch @sardesairajdeep tea boy to PM is a fact and the modulation of it an insult to the modern Mahatma. Now you understand what the Goonda said on Nations Mahatma 
@TimesNow Sambit time has come for you to be slippered. Cow politics is making you people talk bullshit. Your party's Waterloo is nearing 
@sardesairajdeep @republic #RowdyArnab will be the right way to describe 
RT @ShekharGupta: What's going on? Why CBI? Has govt nationalised Paytm? Or has it taken over government? Is CBI underemployed? Or has it b… 
The sleeper cells of Bakthas spring into action for every Tugluk decision of the Showman 
@bhupendrachaube @ashokepandit @AamAadmiParty @INCIndia very soon India will be polarised with frustrated, deprived neo patriots on one side 
Ola was a classic model on surge pricing. Railways copied but omnibus is penalised for increased pricing during demand. https://t.co/sXyk7U3K0Y 
@sardesairajdeep who is pushing whom. BJP chest thumping for something which is a defence strategy and Congress leaks 2011 surgical strike. 
The surgical strike was well supported by all political parties until the BJP put up posters in UP claiming credit

@ETPolitics @EconomicTimes Where is Sushma, is she still on paper the external affairs minister? 
@TimesNow do we have a choice. All the 420's have joined together. Bedi, Shazia, Binny. Now it is equally balanced. AAP i run; BJP i stab. 
@TimesNow Sakshi Maharaj are you hearing to 'i stab' lady. she has been delivering for 40 years !!! 
@ndtv looking at the developments 'i run' and 'i stab' are going to 'i fool'. All 420's are up and running under a dynamic 'i am' India. 
@sardesairajdeep @arunjaitley Equally the business model of BJP is posing a challenge to the nation. 
@ndtv Media was the same for a long period more so when you were in the opposition. Why are you so jumpy now. Is ur budget on media is over 
@TimesNow Have you forgotten that you made mountain out of mole hill during elections using the same media. 
@TimesNow Jaitley has forgotten he has paid the media to capture power more so the Time Now. Arnab plays the role of spokes person of BJP 
@sardesairajdeep Hi Rajdeep, are your future plans made public. Eager to know if you will continue to be in the media. 
@timesnow certainly brand Modi because the brand manager was Times Now. 
Contact Us http://t.co/OFIbdPvi6Z 
@Rajeshgujarat @timesnow why are you so scared of BJP. I am surprised to see AAP aspirations sore sky high. By the way I care a dam for BJP 
@Rajeshgujarat @timesnow Arvind Jokerwal the old honest person in this earth told this.You know he is going on a dharma, go join him now 
Only thing Delhi will experience after Joker's exits is Peace and normalcy. 
Ah effect on watching Arvind Jokerwal ' Bull in a china shop' borrowed from Arun Jetly 
@Rajeshgujarat @timesnow Good to know you are from Gujarat. You have supported a govt for 15 years and now Joker for Delhi moving to India. 
@Rajeshgujarat @timesnow Arvind Jokerwal resigns for his PM aspirations and not for the people. Dont ever include me in the list of Jokers 
@Rajeshgujarat @timesnow Arvind Jokerwal is a pervert politician. Uses people for his PM aspirations. 
@Rajeshgujarat @timesnow A Tiger who will fool all people like you 
Around the world in 80 days is old. Now it is 49 days of AAP Jokers ruling Delhi - Written, directed, produced and seen by Arvind Jokerwal 
Bharat mata ki jai, the common man has got swaraj. Jokerwal has gone in search of the PM chair so that he can change India. 
There is nothing wrong to think you are intelligent, but something is wrong if Jokerwal thinks all the others are fools 
@Rajeshgujarat @timesnow I have Rs 10 with me to give to AAP for their contribution to the common man. Actually to ask AAP not to come back 
@timesnow from the same place where you got the brooms and caps 
@timesnow the new kind of politics included stopping the Republic Day, sending people to find out if anyone is doing something in the bed 
@timesnow a small correction, Jokerwal did not do even one thing right leave alone some mistakes 
@EconomicTimes A joker of the first order. He has lost his nuts 
The greatest showman of Indian politics shoots himself not knowing what to do. The rise and fall of mera naam joker - arvind jokerwal 
In what way Arvind Jokerwal is different from MNS Raj Thakre. The nation wide debate is on. 
AAP will not pay electricity bill. The joker climbs on the electricity pole and he is now the CM. NMS will not pay the toll. Good way to go 
what elections are we going to have in May 2014? are we going to vote for 1984 sikh riots, 2002 gujarat riots, sardar patel ? It is worrying 
@timesnow Now the CBI is not Congress Bureau of Investigation. 
Why should action be taken on Raj Thackeray. What has he done different from AAP Bharti and Arvind Jokerwal? 
Excellent people have started to do their job. Hooda, AAP MLA Keep got it. Arvind Jokerwal has thought this. Go slap if you are not happy. 
@EconomicTimes Ho GOD we have the only noble soul in this earth - Arvind Jokerwal 
@EconomicTimes Kapil if Arvind has pronounced you are corrupt then it is final. He has replaced the role of the supreme court.

Tomorrow a student copying in the exam will say that he is bringing in a radical change against the education system 
@EconomicTimes AAP declares that the President being a former congressman has made such a republic day speech. AAP will go on a dharna 
AAP says they have released the correct video on Bharti raid. I realize if it is from AAP it is correct to courts can wind up 
Preeti Menon has replaced shazia to shamelessly talk in the media 
Kamal Hassan awarded Padma Bushan, Congrats to this great actor 
@ndtv I proud to be an Indian because we can make a joker a CM in 3 months time, because AAP is the only honest set of people in India. 
@ndtv Actually the police was practicing how to bash up AAP demonstrators. 
@timesnow EC please note AAP has reviewed the pamphlets and certified that they are not objectionable.AAP adicves EC to withdraw the notice 
@saur008 @EconomicTimes Go around sweeping every house 
@timesnow Item Girls have some dignity.  this Joker is a strip dancer !!! 
@timesnow Rakhi will object to this Shiv Sena. 
Shazia, have you gone underground. Are you hiding in the wagonR? 
@timesnow Thy who raise questions against Aravind Jokerwal will be labeled as corrupt. 
I notice something for the past 3 - 4 hours. Not a single AAP jokers are on tweets. They have gone underground. May be let down by the joker 
@BDUTT Gopinath, Bedi and Pinky should refuse to talk to Bhushan in the debate. He should be treated as an outcaste 
@timesnow Pick up the law minister and parade him on the streets where every one can spit on his face 
@BDUTT Rowdies have taken over the capital. This is a lesson to the media for making a joker a leader. 
@ndtv Jaitley on your behalf I would like to spit on the face of the Delhi Rowdy Aravind Jokerwal 
@b_zaphai He is not the CM of Delhi. He is the rowdy of Delhi. 
@b_zaphai watch Times Now where your Kiran Bedi is telling the whole nation, which accordingly to you was told to me in private. 
@timesnow Crash course for all the people who have backed this joker 
@b_zaphai @timesnow @ArvindKejriwal Congrats Rowdy Aravind Jokerwal. You have given courage to all the hooligans. What a shame on you 
@EconomicTimes 21 days 21 drama, what more do we need to wait for. Cong pull the carpet any ways cong will not win but can save the nation 
@timesnow Medha Patkar will have to put sense into these people. Anna, Kiran, Patkar and a few are to be blamed for this jokers arrogance 
@b_zaphai The nation as much mine as it is for the joker party. I have the right to see my RD parade and not listen to street fighters. 
@b_zaphai Please remind your Arvind Jokerwal that he is running a govt and not a street corner committee.He should grow up from college days 
@b_zaphai Ho, you want proof like Arvind Jokerwal has on Sheela. 
@b_zaphai He is running a circus not a govt. AAP is a minority govt and holding on to cong whom they challanged 
@b_zaphai @timesnow @ArvindKejriwal Not as good as Arvind Jokerwal who does not know when to stop. Cant you see the nation is laughing. 
@b_zaphai @timesnow @ArvindKejriwal The comedy is best appreciated from a distance. Joining AAP is like committing suicide. Ask Gopinath 
@ndtv The nation will give you a gallantry award Mr Tyagi. Please salvage our nation from these jokers 
@ndtv please break their legs so that they will never in their life come out of their house for such issues. 
I want my capital to be free of these street fighters. I feel like walking up to this Joker and asking him to pack off. 
for once Cong is a sort of getting the public on their side. Arvind Jokerwal is intoxicated with power. Soon people are going to abandon him 
@ndtv What will happen if Supreme Court asks Arvind Jokerwal to vacate the place and do all the drama inside the assembly. 
@timesnow Idiot Arvind Jokerwal, your arrogance is showing up and a bunch of jobless people who stand by you is giving you confidence. 
Dr Subramaniaswamy, you have done so many litigations, can you help in dragging this Arvind Jokerwal to the court and fix him 
There should be a PIL filed by people of India on Arvind Jokerwal wasting the nations time and mocking at the Republic day celebrations 
Arvind Jokerwal did not take bath today....that is why it is raining to wash his stink 
oops Arvind Jokerwal did not use the toilet today, see how had he is working for the welfare of the country 
Breaking News - Arvind Jokerwal brushes his teeth in the streets of Delhi - How can the HM brush his teeth when Delhi is disturbed. 
@ndtv Mr Arvind Jokerwal, no more patience, this is not a fish market. The people from other states will come over to Delhi to vacate you. 
@ndtv What happened to the security standing next to this Joker who happily slept after his drama. Cover them rather than the Joker 
@ndtv Yogendra your smart way of handling the situation is disgusting. Having created this unrest, you will repent for this 
@EconomicTimes Drama artist should have been kicked in his butt the very time he took courage to sit on Dharna with that old hag. 
@timesnow All for votes from a huge vote bank who will be voting for the first time. AAP you will be slippered by the same people soon 
@timesnow Shazia may require the services of BJP and Cong as per Bharti 
Shazia - you are on a TV show 
How nice to hear that Cong and BJP have pimps, what does AAP have? Prostitutes ? 
Somnath Bharti, I feel like spitting on your face and slippering you for your speech 
The nation feels like spitting on the face of Arvind Jokerwal and Somnath Bharti. The media should be after them till they go under ground 
@timesnow Arvind Jokerwal has been able to mobilize a set of jobless crowd. Truly a nation of fence sitters who will gather for anything 
@ndtv Manish should learn to market this walk. He should learn from Arvind Jokerwal 
@jacob_gj @timesnow Yes, all those who lost their jobs in the corporate world. over looked for promotion. Frustrated goup 
@BDUTT @ArvindKejriwal on the spot. reduce the over dose of NAMO. AAP may be playing on behalf of congress. But AAP is a pain now 
@jacob_gj @timesnow Street fighters will never listen. Politics changes in India, only thing is it is going to change in 30 days for AAP 
@timesnow The whole of Delhi is looking at you fool. Can you go and do the job you cheated people of. 
@ndtv Cheap Minister Arvind Jokerwal, I hope the kidnap news of you comes true. No one will protest for your kidnap 
@timesnow Manish Sisodia all your black mailing will come to an end and the end will be for ever for AAP 
@EconomicTimes Kiran Bedi is one of the few who made this Jokerwal. Kiran will have to repent for her actions 
@timesnow can BJP and Congress for the sake of the nation come together and save the nation from such street fighters 
@timesnow Very soon the Broom is going to turn on the AAP. Arvind Jokerwal I am waiting for the news of someone slippering you 
@timesnow Digji Delhi out voted you. So dont worry for them. Bharat matha ki jai. Arvind Jokerwal ki jai. 
@HANDEEPSINGH @ndtv If stopping for the minister whom you voted is below your dignity, I am sure you will not mind. God save Delhi. 
@ndtv Please ask every one to tweet Arvind Jokerwal and tell him thank you for having voted for him 
@timesnow Swaraj has also given me the right to call Jokerwal names. A slipper and slap will tell him to be within limits 
@ndtv Aam Admi of Delhi will not mind because this is what they voted for. Best wishes Delhi. Spare rest of the nation 
@timesnow Ham hai AAP. All the half educated people watching TV and making comments have come out to vote to the Joker. Save the nation 
@BDUTT In 30 days the media has learnt a lesson, Do not truncate the person who pays the maximum. Paid Joker has become a Hero uncontrolled 
@swapan55 Joker Party have not spared the Gentleman called Atal. This is what will happen if the state is given to one street fighter. 
@timesnow When the joker party has made a statement it is final. Can someone slipper Arvind Jokerwal and tell him he is crossing the line 
@timesnow why not BJP and the Congress make a joint statement and salvage the country from this Jokerwal. Power has intoxicated AAP. 
@ndtv The idiot in red sweater needs a waking so that he will never in his life come out of his house. 
What NAMO and Jokerwal are doing by their eloquent speeches and dramatization, politics has become one pattimandram. MANMO is no where near 
Cong. should have a felicitation function to Suresh Kalmadi and its alliance partner Raja of DMK for their contribution to Cong reputation 
@ndtv Is Arvind Jokerwal playing politics at national level after his histrionics at Delhi? 
@ndtv it is difficult to get Jokerwal to the seat. He is used to running away right from his govt job days. 
@EconomicTimes when you are used to street fights and hit and run politics, it is very difficult to sit on the other side and govern. 
@ndtv Why not the public who witnessed the raid yesterday go to Bharti's residence and do a dharna. 
@ndtv Why not take action on Arvind Jokerwal. Any way the police is not going to be allowed to do their job by the Holy honest party 
@ndtv Ho !!! the honest party has given a self certificate and therefore thy who file an FIR will be questioned by the LORD-Arvind Jokerwal 
@Arrow_007 @timesnow obviously the only honest person is going to say the footage is doctored. Law minister was not present !!! 
@timesnow come on AAP street fighters go to the streets tomorrow morning, if possible to the Ramleela grounds and start the Dharna 
@ndtv Congress should hold on to the support and show Arvind Jokerwal what it is to govern rather than street fights and Ramleela's 
@ndtv I remember what VP Singh told in public meetings before his run for the PM post. He has all evidence in his pocket. 
@ndtv Arvind Jokerwal needs an escape route and he is desperately trying to create unrest so that he can pursue his ambition of becoming PM 
@sharadvarshney some times when you read these politicians statement it fits into all characters. Dont you think Adhvani is also the General 
@Anddh this rajnath talking about Advani and Rahul 
@timesnow Jaitley has forgotten that AAP has the mandate of Delhi just like NAMO has the mandate of Gujarat and now of Indians as projected 
@ndtv Arvind Jokerwal must go on Dharna - this is congress conspiracy. We have Goa and now Delhi taking to streets. Shiv Sena is better !!! 
@BDUTT @ArvindKejriwal If the Dharna leader is slippered, who will be arrested - Leader of Dharna or the person slippering? 
If every one has to accept Arvind Jokerwal else they are corrupt, Will the joker be the only person ruling the nation? 
What if  - Kashmir is taken over by Pak,Shiv Sena is forming govt, Adhvani becomes PM, what if Arvind Jokerwal becomes PM - GOD save me 
Advisors of Arvind Jokerwal can include Director of Mudalvan - Shankar. What a stunt man this Joker is turning out to be 
I am reminded of the loud talks from Street fighters after bashing up some one and challenging the whole world-Arvind Jokerwal all the best 
The media who made AAP is now working over night to bring AAP down - congrats do a good job soon and save India 
With Feb 14th soon approaching, Shiv sena will have company from Aravind Jokerwal on his new kid governance 
Kiran now shouting from the roof top is an early - late realization on making a Aravind Jokerwal a hero, the Delhi voters will realise soon 
I am sure Aravind Jokerwal will be the first CM to have egg on his face very soon 
we have made one Thakre and are wondering what have we got under the banner of Hindu religion protectors, now we have Aravind Jokerwal 
Kejriwal, Bhushan, Vishwas, Shazia and other jokers have already done enough damage to the nation by placating corruption. Now what next 
Am I being very cynical to the radical change AAP is bringing in or I am seeing the discord in all that they are singing. 
AAP is the only honest living being in the world. All who speak out are liars. Amen 
@timesnow We had a generally speaking VK Singh doing this and now a BJP candidate RK Singh is gaining public attention. It is politics 
Withdrawal of FDI at Delhi is an aggressive stand taken by AAP inspite of being funded by the corporates 
Are all the sound bites from AAP members across India a strategy to occupy media space 
@ndtv Yes vishwas. Like how you set of frustrated jokers go to the maidan for a road show having no faith in the parliament, 
@sardesairajdeep @swapan55 Will you deny to the fact that the media is not paid for this coverage. 
@ndtv If you do not have anything else to yap tonight, BJP starts a new topic called Devyani indictment is a defeat. This is politics 
why is the media so obsessed with this bushan mad cap statement. Paid media in action. why dont you just ignore and keep moving 
@timesnow Have all these DTC contractual workers made to go to Arvind's residence on instigation from Congress &amp; BJP 
watching the fish market of Times Now and the absolutely professional Pranoy of NDTV. No wonder NDTV Pranoy is a master in Anchoring 
all the TV channels have a question of asking Rahul to be thrown out. Who could have funded this across the media channels 
@ndtv when you start acting like a back bencher calling names on opposition, it excites people. 
@ndtv Now Prasant and AAP team will have to continue entertaining the crowd by keeping up to the promise of slashing the power tariff. 
Coming of age of the nation which is rightly moving towards media hungry. Elections fought via media 
Headlines Today makes a leader in AAP. Times Now demolishes Congress. Social Media get BJP to what it is. Congratulations media - king maker 
Shazia where are you with your inappropriate smile before the camera. Is the sting on you so strong that you went underground 
Modi mastan - do you have any thing for the nation's unity and progress apart from wanting to become the PM 
India grows in the last 10 years. All gang up even at the cost of destabilizing the nation. Post 2014 will there be unhindered work be done. 
Individual agenda of Anna, Kiran, VK Singh, pre AAP Kejriwal is going to help India join the unstable neighbouring countries 
The writing on the wall for congress. Thanks to 2G, Common wealth. Greed for money with a section of leaders has given space for distruction 
Vijayakanth made it to become opposition leader and soon the people started regretting. Kejriwal are you an exception 
@sardesairajdeep Kejriwal apart from providing catharsis to the city of Delhi will also provide catastrophe. Whom to blame? 
@SomaVisal @cooldudetweets @sardesairajdeep No certainly not. This is what the nation asked for. Helped by the media. 
@Soumya_HDixit It is not going to be your disappointment alone. India is going to see anarchy. 
@ibnlive @sardesairajdeep Media - this will be the first elections where the leaders will win because of the value for money the media gives 
RT @ibnlive: Next on CNN-IBN #BattleForTheStates with @sardesairajdeep: We get you the post poll figures, who will win the #BattleforDelhi? 
@ndtv Who is AAP to ask for the footage. AAP can collect it from the courts. Of course AAP does not have faith in the existing institutions 
@ndtv Taking action based on AK histrionics before the public is equally the same as what AAP has been shouting from top of the roof 
@ndtv Good AK will not pay electricity bill, ask people not to pay and now they will take action for mirroring them. 
@ndtv Mr Kejriwal do you want us to believe what you say is only true and what others dig up from your back yard is all doctored 
@ndtv yesterday Modi mastan goofed up on MK Gandhi and there is no detailed coverage in the news. While Rahul's abstract remarks are sliced 
@ndtv EC has censured Modi mastan's remarks and there is no mention in the media. Are you all paid not to cover this 
@ndtv actually every person in Gujarat should write to Modi mastan asking for security. May be he will do it only for those he wants to. 
@ndtv for once the media will be on the back foot and stop playing trial by media. 
AAP Arvind Kejriwal and shazia now  will claim that BJP and Congress are behind the leaks 
Going by the new avatar of Politics - Arvind Kejriwal - all media people should be grouped along with Tehelka and painted in teh same brush 
@sardesairajdeep will Modi ever talk on what BJP will do if it comes to power rather than throw abuses on the ruling party. 
One suggestion Shazia ilmi can try stop smiling inappropriately in the news talk show 
Arnab the news at 10 is a clear fix getting people to have a go at Sanjay. 
Narendra Modi touches the feet of Advani and this is news. In TN every day people touch Jaya feet there is nothing new 
This general assembly will be fought with and by the media. Congress will fail badly only to come back. 
VK Singh you are a shame to the nation. I do not know how you managed to become a General 
Ran to the old hag. Went to the yoga joker, tried to adjust with the absconding govt servant Aravind finally jumped the Modi truck 
Generally Speaking General must be put behind bars for what he is dragged into by the aspiring PM. VK singh thinks he can be another mush. 
I guess Elections 2014 is going to be the upper caste taking a vengeance on all the reservations 
Great to hear Subramanian swamy suggesting india should be divided based on Hindus and muslims excellent keep it. God bless India 
Lessons for Jaya - she also threw stones at the PM no one in the media covered her. Look at Modi he only throws stones at the PM. 
Imagine a India which will  have a eloquent speaking PM. concerned about change in his guju way. We are going to have a real change. 
How is the media management done from the Modi office not even from BJP office ? 
every channel covers Modi's speech. the media is high on Modi. Is it that we will have the first PM who is made by the media? 
How come the media covers every thing positive of Modi and everything negative of the PM 
media covers Modi more than the PM's speech what a shame. 
waiting for BJP to come to power and rip the nation on a different line of thought. 
Paid media can cover me tomorrow if I can sponsor the complete day can Arnab, Barka, Rajdeep come up with their quote please. 
some time back when the old hag and the mango party leader was covered showing the mood of the nation. Where are they now. 
Paid media is at its peak. Every speech of Modi is covered wide and compared to the PM what a shame. 
Is Modi insulting the PM or the nation. 
A marriage that burnt the town and now separated by force and kills the source !!! Is it a costly love affair or a political revival tool. 
People leave their first job prematurely because http://t.co/3kNuGeuP2W 
Live here here lotus Theses Political Joker Needs To Bay Stoneade 
@ndtv Can the attorney general of TN be sued for questioning the senor board and making derogatory remarks on them 
What is the media trying to ask for justice and I am asking the nation today. Do they want public hanging to be done 
Arnab _ my suggestion to make this country better is - please stop from making sensational statements 
@BDUTT Pls don't suggest something which is not what we should be doing. We did a mistake last month in Mumbai. 
Why is this media - HT Rahul trying to make  a sensation of this rape death. Can we kill the rapist and be happy. 
We have the Shivaji park debate for a memorial. Can this 23 year brave girl be immortalized. 
Like the Labor statute, Jalinwala bhag, this brave girl should have a memorial in the heart of the capital. 
A memorial for this brave girl - more to show what shame we have brought to India. Why waste our time on politicians memorial ? 
@sardesairajdeep Can this stand of respecting the privacy of the death and not making a spectacle be code of conduct on sensitive death. 
Sunitha Krishnan your idea of having a data base on the rapist and making it public is great 
Kejriwal and Ramdev shame on you to be there at India gate and piggy ride on this road show and make a political stunt 
@BDUTT We would love to see you, Rajdeep and Arnab moderated by Prannoy Roy on media anchors carried away by sensationalism 
Can there be Do's and Don'ts printed and published to the media people. Looks sensationalism is the only objective of these anchors 
Rape of the girl is very serious and need to handle this cultural issue very carefully. Certainly not the Anna way 
Guess there is some amount of politics media is leading the public in this rape of the poor girl 
@ndtv Mamtha has lost her credibility to even come to Delhi. She rather continues to be a street fighter and settle scores with left. 
@sardesairajdeep How true it has turned out to be. 
Mamata joins the elite list of Prakash Karat and Advani of trying to become a Hero 
It was a long rope given to Mamata. She does not realize that she has a role beyond being a street fighter. 
Back to tweet after a long time 
@BDUTT Mamata the writing is on the wall can you please leave. You have lot of work in West Bengal. Do something good for the nation 
@nwrnvvl3923 @YOURNEWJ0B Your joke is as poor as the one played by Bedi on stage. Open your eyes and grow up 
@MyBankDemo Will he kick the bucket this time...if crowd does not turn up 
@kamaalrkhan The hags will do their best to fool the nation and the accompanying guys who lost their govt jobs will act to theri best. 
Congress govt facing road blocks after another and I am waiting for the opposition to take over in 2014-remeber Mamta and the left in WB 
Vacasya's 2nd appearance in the national artistic roller skating competition at Chandighar got her Bronze. 
It was emotional to see my daughter cry when she was not able to get good scores in her short program at the nationals. 
Vacasya after a hard year long practice, winning the district and state rather easily had to battle it out at the national competition 
I saw the fighting spirit in my daughter fight back from 6th position in the first stage to 3 place to win a national medal 
Vacasa got her first national medal - Bronze in her artistic roller skating held in Chandigarh between Feb 2nd - 8th, 2012. 
Aravind has his wisdom on food security bill too, I guess he is a know all and be all...tat vam assi. 
Mani is in full swing on NDTV. Go Boy Go 
Swamy is known to host a tea party just to meet his agenda. Remember the acid attack on Chandralekha yet joining hands with Jaya 
Swamy joins NDA. Good for NDA. Has been a wasted intelligence for a very long time. Trust he will add value to the double talk NDA 
Jaya divorces Sasi - is this politics or sense prevaling. Do remember the divorce has happened before only to live together soon. 
I think media will never allow the Lokpal issue to die down by making statements like Team Anna will win if the bill is passed on tuesday 
We want cheaper power but no to Kudankulam. Why play politics on everything. FDI, Lokpal, Mullaperiyar, Kudamkulam and all that govt does. 
looks like Anna is the Supreme court and the moral watch dog of the nation when he says he has removed 6 ministers 
Mullai periyar dam is a classical political stage for Karuna. After all he has nothing to lose. I guess he is having a ball in blowing it up. 
The courts say dont proceed on shifting Anna library. Jaya is taking rest at her hill resort. Is she listening? 
Shameless Kiran Bedi sits on NDTV and talks with no guild after all the high pedestal she has taken along with Team Anna on moral and value 
Instead of running behind the DMK MLA's can any thing be done for the roads in Chennai 
'Only one slap' an arrogant man talks like this. Just waiting for the day when only one slap lands on his face, may be he will not be alive 
How come Jaya gets the Law on her side always and Karuna is not able to get anything right when it come to law. 
Road are battered, no relief.... 
Jaya in action - EB to cost 3 time more than what it is. Milk to cost Rs 24/ litter, Public transport - Bus to cost 2 times more. Good 
My early days of working for a corporate, I was assigned the task of getting the resignation from a Business Head for submitting false bills 
Kejriwal to pay 9.5 L  next week ! is this bending or was taking the nation for a ride under his guise as a true gate keeper of the nation? 
October 7th-14th, is going to be high energy Madras University, Daimler, TITAN, Apollo, ITC, Kaleesuwari, Apollo, Chandra, Autoprint. 
Advani has learnt from Anna. He is taking moral responsibility for Cash for Vote, what if the drama maidan is not vacant for the drama. 
JJ goes by road along with public-front page coverage by HINDU,Former Dy CM held page 5 coverage. long live new generation King Makers-Press 
Supreme court raps JJ on samacheer kalvi yet she is not relenting and the people are quite on children schooling... 
BJP comes out with their spineless talk again on the lokpal. Are they trying to ride on the tide of the so called civil society.ll 
SL captain Kumar was a great sport. His speech at the award function showed that he was a true leader. 
Should Psychometric tool (eg. Thomas assessment) be used for selection of entry level personnel. http://linkd.in/hPSSiW 
Increase in Salaries are more than the growth % of the company but other prices including fuel should not increase ! what a dichotomy.! 
Today's article in Economic times on trade unionism in Tamilnadu,I have my strong views on what really is delivered at the grass root level. 
my first tweet. will share my thoughts. Pleasure to keep the idea alive !!!
