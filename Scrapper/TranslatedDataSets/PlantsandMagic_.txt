@SardonicHotshot Ellie sighed and shook her head. "I'm here to help you carry your burdens. I want to help you out. Okay?" She rubbed the back of his hand with her thumb. 
@seb_kogane_ "I do." She went over and started to go through them, so she could save but most of them were dead. She could replant and start again. 
"Yeah, of course. I'm not uhh.. birlliant but... I know enough. Or you could jsut write it down? 
"Oh my god, /sign/ to me then, ass..." 
She is grabbing Emily's arm. "Hey, hey... He's not worth it sweetie. Come talk to me..." 
@seb_kogane_ "I might be able to, I have to be sure they're not beyong help..." She held his hand and squeezed it. "Thank you." 
@seb_kogane_ After a while Ellie turned up, her hair up in a ponytail. She waved at Seb and came over. "It looks better already." 
@seb_kogane_ "Thank you." She moved to her bathroom, undressing and taking a long shower. Once done she dried, dresed and headed to find Seb. 
@seb_kogane_ "Are you sure?" she asked, tucking hair behind her ear. "Thank you, I won't be long." 
@SardonicHotshot Ellie sighed and shook her head. "Alex, stop it... Please. Yeah, I got mad at you, but I don't hate you, okay? WE both have our own issues, and we kinda... clash." 
@seb_kogane_ "I'm going to shower and change, do you want to meet me at my garden in a few?" 
Wow.... 
@SardonicHotshot "...." Ellie frowned. "You don't pick and choose who you fall in love with, Alex. Trust me I know. And leaving you would be the worst idea right now." 
"It's Panic! At the disco." 
"It's from a song." 
"Well I know it just doesn't feel like a night out with no one sizing you up~" 
@seb_kogane_ "... Are you not a couple?" she asked, looking over at him 
@seb_kogane_ Hse sighed and nuzzled into him. 
@SardonicHotshot She sat down and sighed. "Alex..." she rubbed her face. "I was furious at you, I wanted you to suffer but not like this. If I can help in anyway, i'm here." 
@seb_kogane_ "... Well, either for Valentines ot because... You know... You and her?" 
@seb_kogane_ "Thank you..." She hugged him back tightly. 
She sighed. "I will, thank you." 
"... What?" 
"Arva, it's a bad time... They are all arguing, you should go somewhere you can be relaxed." 
"I'll take that as a no..." 
"Has anyone seen Ash?" 
@seb_kogane_ "Oh, you will." She shifted slightly. "So uhh... I can make you up a bouquet fro Amy, if you wanted?" 
@seb_kogane_ She nodded. "Please..." 
@seb_kogane_ "I do, I love it here. You should be here when it's spring, the myriad of colours are amazing." 
@seb_kogane_ "I-I know. I'll fix it, I'll fix all of it. I was uhhh..." he sighed. "It's a long story.." 
@SardonicHotshot "O-okay, okay..." She was finding it hard to be mad at him. "Alex... I can tell her, but that is all I can do... If I can't help you i'm at a loss.... I can be by yoru side?" 
@seb_kogane_ "Seb... What did you want to see here? It's just plants, it's not that exciting." 
@seb_kogane_ "... I-I think I did it myself. I remember being really angry, and i was crying, nect thing I know I'm here." 
@SardonicHotshot "Well, maybe I can use my powers to heal you? Make you better? I've seen Honerva and Allura do it, it can't be that hard." 
@seb_kogane_ "I guess." she knelt by a row of plants and stroked one. "They are just like us you now, alive... Connected to the universe." 
@seb_kogane_ It was a few hours before she woke, her head hurt and her body ached. Looking around she saw Seb. "Wh-Where... what happened?" 
@SardonicHotshot down on her knees besdie him she palced a hand on his shoulder and it glows blue. Ellie is strying to calm him, trying to make him feel better. "Honerva has tuaght me things that can help you." 
@SardonicHotshot She let out a sigh, shaking her head. "And what did you do? You hid... and you ran." She took deep breaths, so angry right now. At him. At others. "I could have helped you, and I feel like I was treated as second best..." Tears collected in her eyes and she walked over to him, -- 
@seb_kogane_ She sighed, a frown on her face. "I'm.. sorry it's not the best subject." 
@SardonicHotshot it /all/ and yet you do drugs and get drunk, and act like a total dick! I fucking hate that I love you, but you can't handle how ungreatful you are!" 
@SardonicHotshot Taking a deep breath she sighed. "You want to know what issue I have with you?" She turned on her heel to face him. "You go on and on about how shit your life is, but you have two parents who love each other. People /like/ you, your mother is /involved/ in your life! You have -- 
@seb_kogane_ "Not really.." She sighed. "I'm was like... Scarlet witch before she exploded, I could have hurt everyone I loved." 
Sobbing hard she dropped to her knees and wave of blue quintesence left her body, washing over the whole room before she passed out. 
Guess who is trashing her garden? 
@SardonicHotshot "And that is all your fault. I have tried so so hard... But you just don't bother. You never bother. I'm done, Alex... I'm not getting hurt by you anymore.." Ellie turned to leave. 
@seb_kogane_ "Honerva. Well, imena kinda. She used quintesence on dad and... What ever was in him must have stored up in me, I guess? 
@SardonicHotshot She took a few steps back, the glow fading and she hugged herself. "That's fresh coming from you, but what ever, right? You can do what you want?" 
@seb_kogane_ "The quintessence helps.." her hand glows blue. "Being connected to the life force kind of helps." 
"Bob does not smell of roses. 
 
He smells of lavenders." 
@seb_kogane_ "Yeah, i've been exploring the affects of quintessence on Mrs Holt's gardening program. I do it here so i'm not under her feet." 
@seb_kogane_ "I-I guess? I read a lot of things and they just stick in my head..." She shrugged and led him into the room. More of the flowers and plants were blooming. 
@seb_kogane_ *White rose 
@seb_kogane_ "Different rose colours mean different things. For example A whilt erose means purity and innocence, A Red rose is love, lavender roses are love at first sight... A deep, crimson blood red rose means mourning." 
She nodded and headed out the door. 
"I brush my teeth perfectly, thank you!" 
"Uhhh... Ash? We urm... We need to talk..." 
@seb_kogane_ "So, What do you know about plants?" She asked, starting to walk. 
"I wanna see his..." 
 
Cough. "S-smiling face..." 
"Wait, who know what, Ash?" 
@SardonicHotshot She pulled back. "Well, no... But it's a start? I'm admiting I did worng nad i'm trying to fix it!" her fists started ro glow blue. 
@seb_kogane_ "Oh, uhh yeah I can do that." She offered her hand and smiled. 
"Thank you." 
"... Really?" 
"I-I can't be here. I'm sorry, I-I always mess everything up." 
She sighed. "I-I... have to go." 
"I'm more worried about your dad trying to kill me..." She muttered, then covered her mouth. "S-Seb... Fuck i'm sorry." 
"So? Has your dad never screamed anything?" 
"You rejected his metal arm... He's not going to hurt you Kuro is a teddy bear." 
Facepalm. "Bad move, Seb." she muttered. 
https://t.co/7PaLDOjfY8 
She nodded. "I'd love that..." 
She nodded. "D-did you know, cause i'm form the future too if you guys ever go back I can come with you?" 
"What... what would we talk about?" 
"... You want to talk?" She smiled. 
"There is no need to stay, I may as well." 
"Y-yes?" 
Oh. Amy is here... She's gonna leave. 
"Glad to hear that..." She sighed. 
"I-I'm fine. A-are you okay?" 
"NO ONE!!" Her face flushed red. 
"...Really?" 
"No, Lance it's okay I understand. I'm sorry I bothered you." 
"... N-never mind, I was wrong..." 
Oh no, abort mission he's mad. "I-i... No?" 
She took a deep breath. "It's Seb." 
"D-Dad... calm down. He's not going to be bad to me, in fact I-I think you'd be happy." 
"I-I think I have a crush on someone..." 
"Do you see Kuro here?" 
"D-Dad?" 
@seb_kogane_ She nodded. "S-So uhh... D-do you want to do something? M-maybe get your mind off it?" 
Screams into a pillow. 
"It would make me weak, but once I rest i'd befine... Allura has done it, with the Balmera and... bringing Shiro back..." 
"I can heal Emily..." 
"Seb? Emily I-I can help?" 
Raises her hand. "Seb? Em?" 
"Ugh, really? Again?" 
@seb_kogane_ She lightly stroked his cheek, her own dark red. "Y-you urm... You want to take your mind off it? Just relax?" 
@seb_kogane_ "I-I know, but I worry about you. About Em. She was my first ever friend and I owe her." 
@seb_kogane_ Then it's a date~ 
@seb_kogane_ Ellie sighed. "I'm so sorry, Seb." 
@seb_kogane_ Her face flshed dark red. 
 
Is he okay with that? 
@seb_kogane_ Excellent. they can see a movie together some time soon~ 
@seb_kogane_ She nodded "Good. But Em? Your dad? Are they okay, did Keith do that to Emily? Her neck looks really bad." 
@seb_kogane_ Well, he is already her friend. Maybe they could go out some time? 
She's huggin @seb_kogane_ and sighing. "Please tell me Keith didn't hurt you." 
@seb_kogane_ Top 10 anime betrayals... 
"Em... you need to calm down." 
@seb_kogane_ EEEWWW, OH my god! 
"You're right, you don't wanna help us... 
 
And dad, come on... Honerva is like, queen of the druids." 
"Never mind, I got excited. We're having problems and I thought you wanted to help." 
"LEVIA CAN HELP!!!" 
"How can I help? I-I know she did awful stuff but Honerva can help!" 
"Wait... Keith?" 
"I heard Emily was hurt, who do I have to kill?" 
@HeirofNewAltea "I remember some of it. Honerva helping me with my powers, teaching me all she could." 
@SardonicHotshot She finced and looked away, hands balled into fists. "I am well aware of what I said, Alex. I'm trying to say sorry" 
@Lancey_Lance_ "hmmm..." she nodded, not sure if she was ready to learn the answer. 
@HeirofNewAltea "I was gone for longer, but yeah, it's hard..." 
@Lancey_Lance_ “Allura? Well, okay.If you say so…" 
@OfHeroicflirts She looked away and frowned. "My dad would know." 
@Lancey_Lance_ "... See how? I don't understand." 
@SardonicHotshot "I know..." she sighed. "I wanted to tell you what was going on but it was hard, I didn't want you in danger." 
@OfHeroicflirts "No one has me under thier thumb! She saved me and I owe her, but i'mnot going to do somehitng evil for her. I have morals." 
@Lancey_Lance_ "I-I'm not sure. I was out for a while, maybe she did something then?" 
@SardonicHotshot "Firstly I want to say sorry. A lot hsa goen on and I wasn't in my right mind. Still, that is no real excuse for being so rude." 
She mustered all her courage and walked over to Alex. "C-Can we talk? please?" 
Want's to talk to Alex but is scared. 
@OfHeroicflirts "W-what did she do?" she squeaked, trying to wriggle out of Alfor's grip. "I don't understnad?" 
@OfHeroicflirts her being..." 
@OfHeroicflirts She grunted as she hit the wall and blinked. what neither of them knew was Honerva's plan was to bring Ellie up as her own, but Lance had put a stop to tat. Still, baby Ellie had been with Honerva long enough for her to make the slip up. "But she was there for me! I-I remember -- 
@seb_kogane_ Ellie walked with him, not sure what else to say. 
@Lancey_Lance_ "Well, she taught me how to control my powers. She made sure I wont hurt any of you by accident." 
She's not a seal you can toss food too... https://t.co/gOLM2qYEDt 
Pokes her head out, tip toeing out of her room she made a b-line for the kitchen. 
Oh fuck, Alex is still here. 
 
Guess she's not getting food today. 
@OfHeroicflirts "Gran.. that sounds weired, Mom is better..." give her a moment, she doesn't realise what she said. 
She saw Alex and stopped, looking around she turned to leave. 
@seb_kogane_ "Then let's go find him first, then go to mom. He can calm her down." 
@HeirofNewAltea "I uhh, thought I saw something, but I'm oaky." 
"...." 
@Lancey_Lance_ "I'm sorry. She offered me help and aslked me to help her, I was so scared. What if I hurt you? Or Kaite? Or papa Kuro?" 
@OfHeroicflirts "I know. I'm learning that the hard way." 
@seb_kogane_ "Do you know where your dad would be? Mom is gonna be in her room, or her lab." 
@seb_kogane_ "A lot of people say it wasn't, but it's done now.." She sighed. 
"I'm kinda trying not to be sick every ten minutes, but when i'm better I'll talk to him. Thank you." 
"Well, uhh... Alex was mad at me and I wasn't able to tell him why I was acting weird. And Seb tried to help me and he and Alex strted to argue and Lando go involved and... Bella I ruin everything..." 
"I've had ... Issues, and I upset Alex by saying something horrible. Now he's pissed and everyone is arguing." 
"It's my fault, Bella. Nothing new there." 
Well now she feels amazing, this is all her fault... 
@Lancey_Lance_ "I don't know, It might be?" She lef ther bag there and walked with him. 
@Lancey_Lance_ She hugged Lance tightly. "I-I don't feel well." 
Bag packed she made her way out her room but had to stop and lean on the wall. 
Thumbs up at Mena. 
"I-I'm fine... I just need to g-go and--" she covered her mouth. 
"N-not now Seb..." 
She's packing a bag, darting to her bathroom every now and. then. 
She got to her feet and ran to the bathroom to be sick. 
Curls up with her back to the wall, hugging her legs and chin on her knees. Her head hurts. 
"Dad, no! Stay, don't go with her..." 
"Oh my god... L-Lotor.. thank you so much." she bowed her head. 
"S-Stop! Lance please, I don't want her hurting you... I'll go with her." 
"She asked me to get some people for her, S-so I did..." 
"I already did it... Just leave me alone." 
She's hiding. 
@Lancey_Lance_ //Brain fart. *Shrugs* IT happens... 
"My family is falling apart. Mom and dad hate each other, my child self is missing and..." she sighed. 
//Why the fuck did I think I was on Emily? 
"Elisa... Thank you." 
"It's better for everyone. I'm dangerous and I upset everyone I meet." 
"What?" 
"... I'm gonna leave. I can't be here, i'm too much a problem..." 
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry i'm not as strong as you. I'm sorry i'm the worst of your children." 
"... Dad?" 
//OMG bad timing it's dinner time XD 
She tries to do what Seb suggested, focusing on anything but Honerva. 
Grabs her head and closes her eyes tightly. "Ungh... S-Stop it... It hurts!" 
Holds Seb's hand. "No. I-I'm not coming with you." 
She looked at Seb. "I-I don't want too." 
She flinched. "H-Honerva." 
"Sebastian is Emily brother... and no... But i'm glad you've shown me how much you actually care for me.." 
"I-It's not like that... Ask Seb, He knows. I-It's not just..." 
"... I-I..." she rubbed her eyes. "I'm having... a lot of trouble with stuff and my head is all weird. I'm sorry." 
"I can explain, I-I'm sorry. I'm really sorry..." 
"I'm here..." 
@seb_kogane_ She nodded and took his hand. "Come on hten..." 
@seb_kogane_ "No one else would help... and I was scared. I took the help I could get." 
@seb_kogane_ "Tell mom when Lance is there, good idea... Shall we go find them?" 
@seb_kogane_ "I didn't have a choice. I didnt' want too, but she did help me." 
@SardonicHotshot She rested a hand on his forehead and her hand lit up a soft blue. "You don't seem off to me, but what do I know?" 
@seb_kogane_ Hugging back she sighed. "Who do we go to first then?" 
@seb_kogane_ "Right... Right, Kaite! My mom. yeah, yeah we should tell her too." She leant into his touch and closed her eyes, feeling comfort. 
@seb_kogane_ She looked at him confused. "M-my mom? I-I don't..." looking at the floor she shook her head. "M-my mom..." 
@seb_kogane_ She shook her head. "W-we need to tell dad... I-I mean Lance. Or Kuro... I-I dunno..." 
@seb_kogane_ SHe hugged herself. "Do you think she has? She was always so... protective of me.. Touching my cheeks, playing with my hair... Do you think she planned on raising me as her own?" 
@seb_kogane_ "I know they all got worried because baby me disappeared, but they seem to have all calmed down now. Something about Honerva, but she would never hurt me!" 
@seb_kogane_ "N-No. i've been getting really bad headaches, forgetting things, and new memories keep popping up. Like my whole past is being re-written..." 
@seb_kogane_ She nodded and looked away. "Were you sent to talk to me? Because I was rude to everyone?" 
@seb_kogane_ She sat up and got to her feet, backing up. "S-Seb... I-I... I would never hurt anyone, you know that, right?" 
Drains the quintessnce from a flower and then revives said flower again.  "Life is so fragile." 
She is in the garden just, crying... 
She's storming off. 
I'm pissed off, okay? And i'm never... 
 
Fuck off! https://t.co/i4Fm04GZHy 
Nothing. https://t.co/lIKPwpY7hw 
Ignore me, i'm in a mood. https://t.co/OkIMjlApeT 
It's fine, Seb. Don't worry about it. you're busy. 
Alex just jealous cause he can't tap Arva... 
No, everything is /not/ okay. 
Whatever, I have plants to heal... 
What? 
This is why I left, Em... 
I'm gonna say it again.... 
Groans. 
No, dumbass that is AC/DC. 
ADHD... 
@seb_kogane_ "I guess? I had to get training otherwise i coudl have hurt those I love, but i'd rather spend a few months with Honreva than hurt my dad." 
@seb_kogane_ the plant started to get better and she smiled, pulling her hands away it looked better. "There, see? Just a little every day." 
// Cat spam. https://t.co/tq5jJjZU0k 
"I want you in my lilfe no matter the realty, but only if you're okay with that.." https://t.co/cJJ1z6rY73 
*cough* https://t.co/nkA53MaSGF 
@SardonicHotshot Hugging him tightly she relaxed, finally feeling home. "you don;t have a dumb face. I kinda like your face." she hummed. "What did I miss? Who lived, who loved, and who died?" 
@seb_kogane_ "To warn you.." She stepped into the garden and ran over to a plant that looke dliek it was sick. She knelt down, plceasd her hands on the plant and her hands and eyes started to glow. 
Guess who wishes she had never come back. 
//This is gonna be Ellie XD 
 
https://t.co/742n5n7acP 
Rolls eyes. "I'm gonna find my guitar and start my new career." 
"I've been talking but you've been ignoring me too... Invisiable my ass!" 
"I AM LITERALLY HERE ALEX!!!!" 
"Where is my guitar?" 
"My first hit in my Country singer career is a cover of Danger zone..." 
"I'm gonna become a country singer and sing about being at a bar and the man who got away." 
@seb_kogane_ "No! People can get scared about stuff like this... I just didn't want you scared." 
@seb_kogane_ "I didn't want you freaking out when my hands do this.." They started to glow light blue, her eyes glowing as well. 
@seb_kogane_ "So, uhh... A little back story before you semy garden. I had to get help from Honerva, the evil witch lady our parents were fighting. So I can kinda do alchemy like Aunt Allura." 
@seb_kogane_ She nodded and offered her hand. "Come with me." she started to walk towards the Garden. 
@seb_kogane_ She shuffled a little closer. "You wanna go do something?" 
@seb_kogane_ Her eyes widen and she blushed. "O-oh... Well, it's working." 
@seb_kogane_ "Are You sure? It's not fair if you're getting me stuff and i'm not." 
@SardonicHotshot "In the flesh." She stepped in and waved. "I wanted to see you, since I came back a while ago.  I missed your dumb face." She teased. 
@seb_kogane_ She chuckled softly, "That is so cute of you, Thank you. What about you? What gift can i get you?" 
@seb_kogane_ "Y-you don't have to remember. U-unless you wntedto, of course." SHe nodde.d "I'm always in the Garden." 
@seb_kogane_ "Oh! yeah, well uh, roses and lilies. The pretty pink ones, and Blood red and purple Roses." 
@seb_kogane_ She nodded. "Glad to hear that." 
Another groan and then Ellie was passing out. 
Rubs her eyes. "Ungh... Headache." 
Winces. 
@seb_kogane_ "... Is that wrong? In my universe your dad is with my mom, so technically I prefur both my dad's." 
@seb_kogane_ "Not your fault. Dad loves me, no matter what.... so it doesn't matter what goes on with mom." 
"Oh! Elisa..." She sighed and the blue in her eyes faded. "... I'll let it go, /this/ time." 
"/WHY/ are you EATING THE FLOWERS?" 
"WHY ARE YOU EATING THE FLOWERS?" Her eyes glow blue. 
@seb_kogane_ "...." she sighed. "My mom and dad had a one night stand, and my mom didn't even tell dad about me until I was about 2 years old." 
@SardonicHotshot It bloomed pretty fast and ther was a soft chuckle from behind him. Ellie had been waiting fro him to reutnr so she could see him agian. 
@OfHeroicflirts "Well..." she sighed. "Like I said I owe her my life. And my Dad's life." She rubbed her face. "And.. she's asking me stuff." 
@seb_kogane_ "Yeah, it's nice to see couples who love each other. I see it in a lot of parents, it's... Nice." 
@seb_kogane_ "What about you? Never a dull moment having Keith and Lance as daddy's." 
 
@OfHeroicflirts "What need does she have for me? She has no qualms with my father, or my dad... And mom would never let her near me..." 
@OfHeroicflirts "She /saved/ my /life/. I trust her more than I trust some of you..." 
//For all of five seconds I wanted to make Yuko from XXX-Holic Ellies' FC XD 
"M Sorry Honerva... shall we go somewhere private?" 
"Dad... it's okay, Honerva isn't going to hurt me." hugs Lance back tightly. 
@OfHeroicflirts "She helped me. I could have killed someone and she taught me to control my powes..." lifting her hand it glowed blue. 
@OfHeroicflirts "Dont school me on equivalent exchange." she folded her arms over her chest. "What's next, gonna bring mommy back from the dead?" She snorted. "I was with Honerva." 
@seb_kogane_ She nodded and sighed. "Sorry, I didn't know she was having trouble. I knwo that,... i've been there." 
@seb_kogane_ “I mean, you’re not wrong. But we don’t dig up pants for no reason. Or trash my garden!” She’s not happy. 
@seb_kogane_ She smiled. "I'm certain your parents are better." 
@seb_kogane_ Friends. "Ha, cool. I guess it is kinda odd seeing your baby selves." 
@seb_kogane_ "Maybe? Once? I've been away fro a while so i'm not entirely sure. A lot happend." 
"Most of us want you to steal us, Lance..." 
@Lancey_Lance_ It was a while later when she came back, wiping tears from her eyes.
