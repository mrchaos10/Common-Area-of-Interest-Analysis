@Christianaulic @LeagueTribune @KingJames @NFL That’s a fine for excessive celebration, has nothing to do with race. That’s like me calling the nba racist because players get techs for hanging in the rims too long lmao 
@Christianaulic @LeagueTribune @KingJames @NFL “When they’d fine players for wearing cleats with BLM messages, hell they fined Marshawn for wearing gold cleats..” That sounds like they fined players for uniform violations, not being against the BLM movement my guy.

@Christianaulic @LeagueTribune @KingJames @NFL No you stop being gullible. When did the NFL say they were against the black lives matter movement? 
@Christianaulic @LeagueTribune @KingJames @NFL Not to mention they allowed Donald Sterling (who was a well known racist) to remain an owner, knowing that he was a racist. They didn’t do nothing until he was caught on tape being a racist. They don’t care about people of color, they care about their bottom line. 
@Christianaulic @LeagueTribune @KingJames @NFL With the NBA being more of a “players” league, they get to have gullible fans thinking they’re “progressive” when in all actuality they’re just as racist. It was the NBA that blackballed players first for protesting the anthem and they doubled down on their anthem policy.

@aztectm @SportsandOtherJ @hberrybenitez @HPbasketball Possibly. I don’t think they live him at all this season though. They could move him this summer depending on if they covet a player in this years draft. They have all the leverage 
@aztectm @SportsandOtherJ @hberrybenitez @HPbasketball AD is under contract until the end of the 2021 season. They don’t have to make a deal right away and seeing as they have arguably the best player on earth they can fish deals until they find the one they want. I think they’ll trade him to Boston before they trade him to LA.

@losfraud @TheHoopCentral Lol 
@losfraud @TheHoopCentral And I feel like you’re the type of guy who believes in the Easter bunny. 
Thank God for this rain. 
@johnnyste1900 @TheHoopCentral You added the mvp topic to the conversation, not me. The original debate was about the media unfair treatment with Russ is accurate. If the golden boy Wardell did this they would be singing his praises all week 
@losfraud @TheHoopCentral I’m sorry, are we talking hoops still or boxing? Because win in hoops is a TEAM accomplishment, not an individual accomplishment. And who told you he doesn’t wanna win? He did? Or did you make that up? 
@losfraud @TheHoopCentral That’s the problem....he continues to ball out like he did in his MVP season the media doesn’t care because he makes getting triple doubles look easy. 
@johnnyste1900 @TheHoopCentral You mean they finally gave the MVP to someone who was actually the most valuable PLAYER and not someone who was the best player and a good team? Ok 
It’s raining!

@eastsidefamous What is McGee doing differently than he’s always done? Nothing. 
@eastsidefamous You right...he’s always been an over dribbling ball hog who plays zero defense. Also, you asked what stars has Lebron helped mold right? Well don’t you have to be a young up and coming player to be molded?

@JJMaples55_MST It’s laughable at this point bro. Goes to show how offense can skew folks opinions on hoopers 
RT @JJMaples55_MST: @PresidentCater they'll still make excuses for Kuzma 
 
Like I said. The worst defensive player in the NBA. 
 
@Bretiful I think even back then it was a set up for failure too. My grandfather was a skilled carpenter but because he had a 5th grade education and zero to no guidance, his businesses could never take off like he wanted. But you’re right, in today’s economy it’s a recipe for disaster 
@Abyousocrazy Very sad and ignorant to be quite honest. How can you expect a child to make it in this world on their own with no support? That’s one major issue with black parenting that doesn’t get talked about enough. 
It’s some folks who parents kicked them out in high school or even younger and let them figure shit out on their own. Personally, I could never see myself throwing my child to the wolves and expecting them to succeed. That’s unrealistic. 
@crym89s My sentiments exactly bro 
@crym89s Right. Lol I think we all have been blessed to some degree by our own parents but as adults recognize that there were some things our parents missed. Hell some folks don’t even know their biological parents. 
I envy those of you who grew up with parents that taught you about credit, investments, etc. Some people weren’t prepared for adulthood 
Of course we are https://t.co/ezRxWGTuHj
