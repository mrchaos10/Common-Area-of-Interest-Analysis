@nyolinyol @kompascom Hari gini, Om? But, yes, please. And don't expect to get it from @jokowi huh. Impossible. 
Admin @ManUtd is definitely getting ready to type like this: Go Chelsea, Go! #GGMU #MCICHE 
@Mudaperkasaalam @zarazettirazr @KemenPU @Info_BinaMarga @DitjenSDA Situ Minang people, no? Well, now try to answer: Ratna Sarumpaet in surgery or plastic surgery? 
 
Prabowo said that all of them were beaten. Where do you think? 
@ ibach77 @zarazettirazr @KemenPU @Info_BinaMarga @DitjenSDA His office is on Jalan Pattimura, Om. Next to the National Police Headquarters. Come on, bro. 
@zarazettirazr @KemenPU @Info_BinaMarga @DitjenSDA Do not be hasty, bro. He is there his capacity as chairman of the organization. The accuracy of him is the Special Staff of the Minister of PUPR. Well, so that the news is widely clicked on, Pak Firdaus is put forward as a staff official. 
@suroso_andri @kompascom Where is it wrong? It's a matter of just giving support, Om. 
@joni_nih @kompascom @ FERRYIR08912826 Obviously from Indonesia, Cuy? 
@team_emak @kompascom Now, who is this aunt choose? 
@andyzulfiana @kompascom There is no way that much mass can be paid for. 
@nyolinyol @kompascom Which one does Om Irwan himself choose? 
@sudjiwotedjo The point is, don't choose the wrong one, Om. Especially if you don't choose. Carefully sorry. 
@ radit_87778 @DjanChoek Antara us, no need to wait April 17th. Just tonight: 01 coblos, right? 
@andiksastro @DjanChoek Piss pants. 
What happened in Indonesia after Rizal Ramli's chatter? Alright. It's even better to be under the control of @jokowi https://t.co/w9I3E1h0wI 
@simonshutabarat Cuy, have you noticed since when your video is circulating? And look, Indonesia is still fine and even better. Stable. Airports, malls, restaurants are always full. New motorbikes and cars go around every day. Be aware, yeah. 
@afr_dana @kodobong @jokowi Then, you only have to type "Really, Bro", then I gawk, and choose 02. It's been crazy, this friend. 
@kodobong @ arifinarsitek88 @BastianMuntu @ Geanmarcindypu1 @jokowi Hehe ... Never mind, boss. You have to digress far. Even if it's jammed, I'm sure you'll pee in your pants. And damn it, you still don't care and then choose 02. So, I'll see you on April 17. 
Prabowo's supporters are spreading in the traders' stalls in the northern coast line which are considered to be affected by the construction and operation of the Trans Java toll road. They recorded the suffering of the traders there and claimed that the construction of infrastructure was useless. 
@tiyaristyar Seriously? No hoax, right? 
@HeniMenesis @lukmansaifuddin That's affirmation, Heni. 
@kaesangp Among the 1,600 people who reciprocated this, how many of them were not supporters of his father in the presidential election later? 
@KedaiKyatha @kodobong @jokowi @SBYudhoyono Yes, never mind, I hope you try Prabowo. Congratulations on choosing. 
RT @erberveldpieter: @riyanadji @IndrA_zedaracht @addiems @SBYudhoyono @jokowi @Ferdinand_Haean Oh from the sby era, I just found out. Judaism ... 
@Cryp_Saurus @ LutfiAnanto @ Putra_sunda82 @narkosun If Lu sincerely supports Jokowi, then he must also openly accept UAS support if he wants to support Jokowi. 
 
I said that because even from a long time ago I had never had strange comments about UAS so far. 
@rudyabrar @jokowi Okay, never mind, until here I just let you vote for Prabowo. But, once again I beg, far from Jokowi's account. Play into a Prabowo account. 
@KedaiKyatha @kodobong @jokowi @SBYudhoyono Bro, you don't see who follows me. But look at what I've followed. Translucent 1,000 more accounts / people. All pro Jokowi. Then, do you think all of their minds are not healthy? Besides reason, the eyes also need to be healthy, Bro. Open your eyes to all of Jokowi's performance so far. 
@ JrHery_92 @ Putra_sunda82 @narkosun, what's wrong with that? And how come sorry? Ordinary. 
@zoelfick Yowis, just jump squats then. Hehe ... Anyway, where is the Scout, Om. I used to be a Therapist. 
@KedaiKyatha @kodobong @jokowi @SBYudhoyono I do not know if you really have just played social media or have been with other accounts for a long time. I see you just joined Twitter as of December 2018. Which one do you think? New or old? If it's new, I'm not surprised by your last reply. 
@KedaiKyatha @kodobong @jokowi @SBYudhoyono Never mind, Bro. Want any data to be held in front of your eyes, as long as your heart is covered with hatred, it will be of no use. So, my last suggestion, you are Prabowo supporters, please stay away from Jokowi's account. We eneg read your comments every time Jokowi is witty. 
@ Putra_sunda82 @narkosun Yes, I hope UAS's eyes and heart will openly see Mr. Jokowi's work so far.

@ Eka97919492 @Damai_Pemuda @kodobong @jokowi @prabowo It's not that easy, Ferguso. It's not that easy. Never mind, if Prabowo really wants to make a real contribution to this country, it doesn't have to be a president. Just take another role. Lu too, already, just try Jokowi. 
@KedaiKyatha @kodobong @ Eka97919492 @jokowi @SBYudhoyono Cuy, Lu studied economics really first. Don't just listen to Rizal Ramli. Unfortunately Sri Mulyani was reluctant to lecture about the economy. If it's not, begh, pee in your pants, Lu! 
@rudyabrar @ Eka97919492 @jokowi Hehe ... This time, it seems like I really have to go to this campaign. Uh, Cuy, aren't you studying economics at school? Do you really understand if you discuss "economic growth"? Don't understand half, I'm also sure Elu doesn't understand anything about economic growth. Just come from. 
@Damai_Pemuda @kodobong @ Eka97919492 @jokowi @prabowo Anyway, there is no need to debate long: Choose Jokowi only. Point. 
@rudyabrar @ Eka97919492 @jokowi Actually, we Jokowi supporters are very sorry to see you supporters of Prabowo who constantly harass the president who has worked hard to build the country. Hopefully you are not one of them. 
@KedaiKyatha @kodobong @ Eka97919492 @jokowi Lu check your mind again, Cuy. Don't accuse other people who are stupid, uh, it's not like you're stupid. Meditate. Absorb. Pay attention to Jokowi's work. There are still 60 days left.

There are already some who are starting to saturate the 2019 Election discussion. In fact, they want to be finished quickly, not using it for long. After that, peering again was a potential candidate for the 2024 Presidential Election. 
@ Geanmarcindypu1 @kodobong @ Eka97919492 @jokowi Cuy, my advice, Lu don't absorb the information in half. Must be intact. Why? Because of the loss, yes, you yourself. Not us. Lu don't want to be fooled by those who want to plunge this country. Be aware This is serious. 
@ Geanmarcindypu1 @kodobong @ Eka97919492 @jokowi It is clear that emotions see people ungrateful to leaders who have worked hard. After all, if you will not vote for Jokowi, why will Jokowi reply. Clear now? 
@kodobong @ Eka97919492 @jokowi There are two kinds of Prabowo supporters. Smart and wise. Smart, he said the others were stupid. Sok wise, he regretted the reply of Jokowi's supporters who were already bitter with the insignificant comments from Prabowo's supporters in each of Jokowi's chats. Kampretlah.

Don't count again how many times have you watched the 4-second video of Habib Bahar bin Smith's action today. Start waking up until you want to sleep again tonight. All accounts seem to have retweeted the video. Extraordinary. 
Crazy, want to be fried until when is the case of Habib Bahar bin Smith? 
I agree that Bahar Smith's detention was suspended. Then we wait, he runs away or stays male facing the legal process. So, Intel must keep its movement. If there is an intention to run away, yes, just shoot the leg. I'm curious.

Jalan Gubeng in Surabaya sinks. But, it doesn't feel right if it's breaking news by @KompasTV. Exaggerating. 
@AndiArief__ Ask first which one is right, Om. Don't use "maybe". Don't let you just like this just because of "itchy hands" only. Cuit is important, don't change the coins. You are the General Secretary of the big party, you know. Talk about you. 
There is a video of Bahar Smith opening a victim with a duration of more than 6 seconds, right? The victims were lying there. What's in circulation is only 4-6 seconds. 
@siregar_one @GakUsahNgegas @budimandjatmiko Maybe, but if it's certain. Foolish.

@VIVAcoid Danger, here, @VIVAcoid makes this tendentious title. Why do you only highlight jengkol and banana while there are several other commodities called @jokowi in the statement? #provocateur 
@Ferdinand_Haean Here's how it says Jokowi: Plant coffee, cinnamon, jengkol and banana, and better mangosteen, because demand is very high by neighboring countries, such as Thailand, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and others, the demand for mangosteen is very large, "he said.

@ thegm19 @Maulana_Tigor @ Cobeh09 Like you just read a newspaper every day. 
@Maulana_Tigor @fadlizon I still think it's normal. Ahok still wants to give a statement even though he then feels angry because of his high tone. If the reporter feels right, just argue with Ahok's argument. They are silent. Just record and then make viral. 
@emerson_yuntho @KPK_RI Wajeb! Appeal!

Blunder is Prabowo's camp. Why should the Boyolali Regent Seno Samodro also be beaten? Well, really zero later Prabowo in Boyolali.

Countdown: 161 Days Towards Election 2019. 
It cannot be denied that some of Jokowi's supporters actually belong to the sontoloyo category. Hopefully only a small portion, not big. #SelasaJempol

@zarazettirazr @ MahfudArifin10 It's normal, ah. No need to overdo it. Let alone Yusril, even if SBY turns around to the Jokowi line tomorrow or the day after, Jokowi's supporters are ready to accept with open arms. 
@ PBB_19 @ MahfudArifin10 Please read, Min. What is expected from the follower is only 59 seeds. Yusril is realistic, naturally his political choices change. 
Uh, Satan is also surprised when you carry it. Who is tempted? Your mouth is like a devil, the work isn't right. https://t.co/22RXZDvd2n 
@ Fitriabdillah8 And even to close public roads in order to open stalls. 
The important thing is that Prof. @Yusrilihza_Mhd already knows who is sincere with you and knows the risks with Mr. @jokowi. Yes, as Prof. Yusril is looking at this now. 
 
Don't care, Prof. You have made the right decision. 
How much more will it take from @Ferdinand_Haean to make @SBYudhoyono @AgusYudhoyono @hincapandjaitan aware that they are maintaining poor quality people at @PDemokrat @PartaiDemokrat ??? 
Don't panic like that, Bang @ eae18? Just relax, ah. It was because Yusril just panicked. 
Only one thing needs to be emphasized to Bro @FaldoMaldini early on: a promise not to give an envelope to prospective constituents in the Bogor Regency there. If politicians as young as he is still relying on money politics to get votes, this country will be destroyed. 
The matter of changing the VOCATIONAL SCHOOL of the House of Representatives just seems to be going on just in a matter of days. How come, the matter of changing DKI Jakarta Governor's Office takes up to almost one period, huh? - @aniesbaswedan 
After being left just like that, at the time of the voting later, will Mrs. @RatnaSpaet continue to choose @prabowo or switch to select @jokowi? Don't abstain, Namboru. 
@ HipHop74934648 How come, hypocrite? More precise, realistic. 
@PowerEmak Don't be surprised, Auntie. Let's welcome it, like Mr. Jokowi accepts it. 
@ HipHop74934648 @daikindo @ pujangga1123 There is no need to assume all kinds of things, especially just guessing unclear. Think of it as an existing political reality. 
Oops, come on ... Don't support Jokowi in ways like this again. It's the same as Jokowi said: sontoloyo. https://t.co/4oTUFnFNMl 
The best advice for Pak @Yusrilihza_Mhd tonight: don't delay any more time to express support for Mr. @jokowi 
@ pr1841788 @Dwiyana_DKM Do not laugh. Greeted with open arms, dong. 
@Dsinathrya Betul too, anyway. Only a handful woles. But there are many who are reluctant because they think of five years that are not for a moment too. 
@zoelfick @lionairgroup He said, it was precisely at times when it was safest to take a plane, even though the plane had just crashed. He said, the work of the airline was getting more careful. 
In my opinion, it is better for the @prabowo camp to leave this Boyolali issue. No need to be brought to Bawaslu. The longer and longer this Boyolali affair, the opponent will fry it until it burns. Tired. 
@PowerEmak Cc-in @PEPESOfficial dong, Tante. 
@GotamaPradipta @Takviri Haha .... Panas lu, ya, Got? 
@CNNIndonesia Taufik, if he believes that Prabowo wins the presidential election, surely he just wants the Jakarta wagub seat for PKS. Later Prabowo will become president, at least the minister's quota. Cook it can't. But, because he wasn't sure Prabowo won, the choice was to find it safe at the city hall. 
@Irenecutemom Can only help prayer for the Basarnas team. Hopefully they will remain enthusiastic. 
@Dahnilanzar @prabowo @sandiuno Take a breath first, Bang. We are waiting for the sixth, seventh and eighth. Mauliate 
New check of the 2019 election final voter list in Central Java: 27,430,269 people. 
 
Among them, from Boyolali: 784,860 people. 
Who still chooses @prabowo there? 
@habibthink Do you know what this father account is? I want to follow.

@budimandjatmiko Tampang Padang, please. Like @FaldoMaldini 
@budimandjatmiko Phone Taufik Kurniawan and convey the same message you can try, Mas. Whispered, "It is part of repentance." 
Shocked and just found out that Mbak @Indriasiane turned out to be with Prabowo and Sandi. Former commissioner of the National Human Rights Commission and Global TV Editor, right? 
Siane Indriani ??? Former Komnas HAM people ??? One with Prabowo ??? It was terrible that he was the only one in the squad. 
The issue of the detention of Taufik Kurniawan was fried a little longer until it was burnt, and the address sank PAN.

Hopefully the "swing voters" have begun to be able to take decisions, choose 01 or 02.

Meet some @Jokowi support accounts whose numbers are followed and followed are still a bit like this account. And hope they are indeed newcomers to the universe of Twitter. 
@kangdede78 I don't have to bother too, @kangdede78 :) The point is, keep the support of Mr. @Jokowi delivered peacefully. 
@makLambeTurah Mantap, Mak. Support Mr. @Jokowi, right? Support peacefully, Mak. Don't be fierce, ah. #usul

@emerson_yuntho, who is ZH, Om Son? Don't like to be inconsequential, ah. 
I am sure this Ma'am @yennywahid is purely supportive without expecting anything in return if @Jokowi will win for the second period. Ministerial position, for example. But, this Yenny also deserves to get a ministerial position. #YennyWahidProJokowi 
@iKhalis @Metro_TV While waiting and reading other media, Om. We'll see if there are similar news in addition to Metro TV. 
@BaniKecebong @Metro_TV Om, if this is like a game project, anyway. Unload and install. It's been a long time ago, even when it's still led by Ahok. Okay, it seems like it works, but don't just look at it, Om. Well, you know, you know. 
Actually, I'm not surprised #YennyWahidProJokowi :) I was shocked and very surprised that he was actually Pro Prabowo. 
@faridmoestofa @KompasTV @yennywahid There's no need to speculate about #YennyWahidProJokowi. Without being clear and open this way too, has been read how come the direction of support. 
@dedprabu @KompasTV @ganjarpranowo Thinking about it, Om. 
@suardi_bandaro @KompasTV Don't know. Not good. It is not clear what try #YennyWahidProJokowi statement 
Relieved if the story is #YennyWahidProJokowi :) Thank God. 
@iwatikk @antasena_wisesa @LawanPoLitikJW @jokowi Wow, Ma'am is very prosperous in the era of @Jokowi 
But, still do not like the few supporters of Pak @Jokowi. Why is it not like trying to embrace an opponent's supporters sympathetically? :(
