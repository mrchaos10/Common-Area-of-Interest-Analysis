@LA_Rosewood @Donpeezly I further proved my point that in the English language you don't need to specify some or all for understanding 
@Queen_Miso @LA_Rosewood It's like he's purposely not trying to understand. And it is a specific group "people of Africa/Africans"

@Donpeezly @LA_Rosewood I can dig up tweets from when she came for black women and black men were gassing her saying she look good and her ass fat. In the same space. Just because it not y'all don't mean it's not truth to my statement. 
If I say people in Africa are struggling. Does that mean every person in Africa is struggling? Or does that mean people who live in Africa

@Nooooooope_ Cuz it was obviously a diss. 
Yes the hell y'all did maybe not you as an individual but yes. https://t.co/Nk1rtuIFaA 
@Nooooooope_ She didn't try to offend anyone that's why it's wrong to make crack jokes. And that's why it don't correlate 
@Nooooooope_ And I said that last part. Don't make the jokes. Especially if you gonna be mad at who laughs. Demi wasn't on the same time at all. Thats why I feel it don't correlate 
@Nooooooope_ Its not a narrative. It's the facts. Couple years ago she was like black girls hate me cuz black men want me and the black men were on here like well her ass fat tho. So make the two different points cuz black men made her comfortable. Period. 
@Nooooooope_ Demi was laughing at memes on Twitter. People violated. If it's not funny then why the jokes if only some people can laugh? 
Also nahjulz is downright disrespectful. Who was there recording w her when she rapped that. Not a black man. He laughed right 
Black men definitely who put the battery in NahJulia back. 
Demi ain't even have her energy so I'm not sure how that correlates. 
@NoFreeBands I'm not lol just reminded me of you is all 
@Nooooooope_ I get the point you're tryna make but you shouldn't have tried to connect the two.

@iAMdaintyyPosh Hope. But that's not it. 
@iAMdaintyyPosh People don't even be looking at the price before they have fear of going. 
@iAMdaintyyPosh "but it's not as if you can't go" the flights are there. And there are other countries to visit. 
Actually spent the same amount I did in Egypt as I did in Nigeria. I was in Egypt two days and Nigeria 7. 
@arielamali @adidasoriginals congrats !! 
@iAMdaintyyPosh but its not as if you cant go. thats like going to trinidad during carnival time. its gonna be more expensive. and morocco and egypt are more expensive when you get there so its still the same 
@iAMdaintyyPosh Then don't go when it's $1200. That's only during December cuz that's when everyone is goin. Maybe September for Ileya

Yea cuz you can't be colored and white at the same time https://t.co/GDLItwh67i 
@Gr8PipeGuapo if a skin tone can make or break your face that would make one better than the other so colorism. or 
"you would look better if you were lighter/darker" 
@EZLaFlare compliments are always taken different across genders tho. like a lot of men dont like being called thick. when its a compliment to a lot of women. 
@Khiaskeys @Vnilla__ someone asked why people always compare dark women to chocolate saying its not like they call lighter women custard 
@Jo_GotGame Attributes yes. But if someone calls me chocolate that does make me feel like that person thinks im cute or beautiful makes me thing they think my skin is the same color as chocolate
