@AFTVMedia Send him to Italy to learn how to defend. 
@ManUtdFF @FootballVines Don’t want a manager who says trophies are not important 
@TiMiSdRuNk @sportbible So what? De gea faced more shots because of united shit defence, now Allison faces a few more than usual and he’s letting in most of them. Until he makes 5+ significant saves in a game that makes Liverpool win, he is no where near De gea. 
@NBCNews Jesus, how many people have to die before someone admits there is a gun problem 
@twofatfeet @alexasp1980 @Sporf @SLBenfica @slbenfica_en What you saying is literally means nothing, at the end of the day, every team should start at the bottom and work there way up, irrespective of score lines or any of that shit. They shouldn’t even be given a chance to leapfrog the lower divisions. 
@twofatfeet @alexasp1980 @Sporf @SLBenfica @slbenfica_en Just because they are better than all those teams, doesn’t mean that they should leap frog them in the league. They need to prove that they are better than the lower league teams first. It’s retarded how you think that then going into the top league is fair, it’s the opposite. 
@twofatfeet @alexasp1980 @Sporf @SLBenfica @slbenfica_en It’s not about bullying other teams. It’s about being fair. If someone created a team and filled it with world class player, they shouldn’t be allowed to go into the top league, they should start at the bottom. 
@twofatfeet @alexasp1980 @Sporf @SLBenfica @slbenfica_en It’s not unfair, unfair is putting a new team in the top league. You can’t just go straight to the top, you should start at the bottom like everyone does. 
@twofatfeet @alexasp1980 @Sporf @SLBenfica @slbenfica_en How you think a team going straight into the top division is fair is beyond me. 
@genmander @Minshy86 @Sporf @NUFC @themichaelowen You can defend it all you want, the facts remain, majority of people have no clue who he is, he hasn’t been covered as much as you make out, people STILL don’t know who he is after the transfer, and there will be plenty on match day asking who he is as well. 
@Karleaves_ @DevilsStandUTD @alx_spacecowboy @premierleague 9/10 people eat rats in their council house in Liverpool 
@genmander @Minshy86 @Sporf @NUFC @themichaelowen Face facts, he wasn’t that well covered, it’s not as though everyone has been talking about him. 
@genmander @Minshy86 @Sporf @NUFC @themichaelowen Couple of good reasons why me and lots others don’t know who he is: 
 
1) Linked with Newcastle 
2) Plays in MLS 
@deanwsmith @nngpssn @Sporf @Arsenal @Aubameyang7 @BVB @premierleague @premierlegue Wouldn’t put money on that “champ” 
@genmander @Minshy86 @Sporf @NUFC @themichaelowen Living under a rock? The majority of Newcastle fans haven’t got a clue who this is, plus he played in the MLS. Behave will ya. 
@p0uting Imagine being that vein that you put the most attractive month as your birth month. Calm down love you are nothing special. 
@Ryan_Jonesyy_95 @sportbible Dancing is childish now I guess? 
@SashKX @ManUtd @RomeluLukaku9 No shots in open play anyway, that free kick was awful tbf. 
@SashKX @ManUtd @RomeluLukaku9 i'd like you to get a clip of a bad touch he made that game cause I didnt dee one. Don't think he actually shot today mate. He held the ball up on the right and made simple forward passes.  And when he did fuck up it was attempting to go forward. 
@SashKX @ManUtd @RomeluLukaku9 You watch the game? What part of that performance was shit? 
@MikeDriver1 @BBCSport Cheers drive, but it’s colossal* 
@LiamGrundy1 @BBCSport Says it all really xx https://t.co/Pn88APqPwG 
@LiamGrundy1 @BBCSport Only a chant kid calm down. 
@jakebutler634 @SkySportsUK2019 It’s only a chant kid, calm down 
@jakebutler634 @SkySportsUK2019 Can you not use that language please it’s not nice. 
@discussions_uk @ManCity Apart from the Etihad ofc 
@Roberto_Holdini @ODDSbible Bet you wouldn’t say it to his face. 
@IGN A perfect example of how unconscious bias effects opinions. Black people love black panther, for the rest of us, it was a load of black culture shoved down our throats. BP was a good movie, but doesn’t come close to infinity war. 
He’s just saying that rivalry shouldn’t come into this. 
@Steel_Pulse1 @ShaneSpencer79 @TJDillashaw He says this every time he loses, he might say he wasn’t hurt but he got dropped and ground and pounded. It might have been a tiny bit early, but he wouldn’t of recovered from that ground and pound. It’s funny when fanboy casuals like you think they know everything. 
@D_J_D1993 @TJDillashaw Sorry badman Dean, I bet he’s shitting himself. https://t.co/bzMEufsgvJ
