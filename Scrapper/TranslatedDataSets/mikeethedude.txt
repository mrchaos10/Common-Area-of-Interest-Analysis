I'm still on the fence about Hello Neighbor. I've played through quite a bit of it, but I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone. It's somewhere between a fumblecore game and a stealthy platformer. The problem is that it isn't too great at any of those things. 
It seems like anyone working on #drupal knows this, but your team should be developing in a virtualized environment if possible. It can really reduce oddities during the workflow. https://t.co/EhrqmUFud4 
@KaiserNeko https://t.co/XWWIb1YVNh 
@t_wolfing @arhourigan I'm willing to accept that. :) 
I'm surprised I haven't installed a @letsencrypt cert until just now. 
Whether it is #drupal or something else, you should be cautious before you go and buy a prepackaged solution for your web/software needs. In some cases, it can save you a ton of development time, but when something goes wrong it can be a lot of pain. https://t.co/BU3vqS33q9 
Nothing like using Imagick to turn a PDF into an image. Just another fun adventure in #webdev land.

So sad. He will be missed. #ThankYouIwata  https://t.co/1XSpEeuJev 
@Chilis Why doesn't your rewards registration form give a better error than "Whoops something went wrong. Try again" ? Not really helpful 
Love the games in the rare collection but will my nostalgia filter save these n64 era games from showing their age too much? #E32015 #XboxE3 
This is why I haven't upgraded to an Xbox one yet. Now I may have a reason with backwards compatibility and more fallout. #E32015 #XboxE3 
True. DOSbox will have to do for now. Unless someone finds some spare time for a jazz hd re-release. Just sayin' https://t.co/CoegZQkMkK 
@therealcliffyb Aw now I need to find a way to play jazz jackrabbit again. 
Google calendar + drupal + fullcalendar .js + restful = Super awesome interactive calendar. Spent too much time on the one. 
@DisneylandAP Our four yr old foster daughter is a frozen fanatic (duh). Are any of the frozen characters around the park during the day? 
@DisneylandToday  We are so excited to be bringing our foster kids to @Disneyland for the first time! Should be amazing for us and them :) 
Building a calendar app is not as fun as one would imagine. Yes, that means negative fun. 
Definitely didn't ditch the last session of #DrupalConLA final session for an evening at the beach. :) http://t.co/M93nwnJrok

Excited for Drupal 8 module development. Let's see how much I already know :) @SANDcamp #SANDcamp

@pandora_radio @theglitchmob Actually I'm pretty sure Our Demons (Hive Remix) is my favorite on the album. Though I liked them all. 
@pandora_radio @theglitchmob Hard to pick yet! I really liked I Need My Memory Back (Boom Bip Remix). Definitely a great album! 
Listening to the new @theglitchmob album on @pandora_radio. Super cool to listen to the album before it comes out! Pre-ordering :) 
Advised that singing or humming a tune at bed time helps baby fall asleep. So I chose Zelda's lullaby :) #gamerdad

Ever wonder where video game characters keep all the stuff they pick up? My theory is wormholes in their pockets.
