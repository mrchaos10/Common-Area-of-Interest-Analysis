A picture with a blurred background is blurred. Although it is called "photograph with shallow depth of field", even in photographs in which "depth of field is deep" all clearly, you can easily create background blur in Photoshop.

Areas to be expressed in one design are limited, either paper or web. 
"MS Gothic" and "MS P Gothic" This P is an abbreviated form of proportional, even when double-byte characters such as half-width alphanumeric characters and Japanese are next to each other, the character spacing is displayed beautifully. Try mixing fonts with P not alphanumeric and try writing letters? You see, it got rid of it? 
Did the design stuff run out? That is because you neglected the input. Stop eating and stopping, go to museums that have never been, and exhibitions. If you do not know you can not produce it. It is the same in any field creation. 
There is a site called "NIPPON COLORS - Japanese traditional color" that Japan unique color can see in "name" and "RGB" "CMYK". It is a site where colors are actually reflected by clicking the name. 
If you are in trouble with Japanese color scheme, it will be interesting to refer to it.

Let's think about using "60-30-10 Rule" after going back to the beginning after fixing with color scheme. 
· 60% main color 
· 10% accent color 
 
If you try to make it by binding with this number, it will be surprisingly simple.

Did the design stuff run out? That is because you neglected the input. Stop eating and stopping, go to museums that have never been, and exhibitions. If you do not know you can not produce it. It is the same in any field creation. 
Photos, graphics, music .... Everything is created by somebody and I am working hard to create originality. 
 
What did you do to give originality to that design? 
Have you played it when you find the favorite code when copying music? Design is the same. Of course there is a need to be trendy, but if deviating from the basics it will be lost in the original meaningful design "easy to use". Fidelity of the basics, put out originality!

Many people who can not design are bad because they do not make elements meaningful. For example iPhone. Why is there a home button on the immediate side of where you have it? Of course it is easy to push. If home button is on top it is hard to push? so. The meaning of this natural element is important. Think about the meaning of the element.

Well music, this song and the phrase of this song are the same! ! Although the talk rises frequently, since there are more people who make songs in the world as much, it is likely to be a similar voicing if the chord progression is the same. 
In some cases the design may also be influenced by what the creator has seen in the past. That logo is .... Dunno.

Gothic has "stop" and "pay", the widths are the same in length and width. Suitable for short sentences and headlines. 
There is "stop" "pay" in tomorrow, the vertical is thicker than the side. It is highly readable and suitable for long sentences.

Never ignore the display! 
You can say almost all the software to input characters, are you putting characters in default by kerning, tracking by default? 
Failure to do one stuffing changes the balance of the whole. Do not despise character stuffing. 
Areas to be expressed in one design are limited, either paper or web. 
For instance, it is really important to set the elements to include before designing, as it will determine the shape of a jigsaw puzzle. I hope to keep anything from the foundation. 
UI designer Takayuki Fukatsu explains it in an easy-to-understand manner (tears 
Well understood, why are there many designers thinking that "the logo of the Olympics and Liège are not similar?"

Let's think about using "60-30-10 Rule" after going back to the beginning after fixing with color scheme. 
 
· 60% main color 
· 30% relative eye-catching color 
· 10% accent color 
 
If you try to make it by binding with this number, it will be surprisingly simple. 
It is basic in interior and fashion world. 
"MS Gothic" and "MS P Gothic" This P is an abbreviated form of proportional, even when double-byte characters such as half-width alphanumeric characters and Japanese are next to each other, the character spacing is displayed beautifully. Try mixing fonts with P not alphanumeric and try writing letters? You see, it got rid of it? 
Often, in design production, it is often the case that clients modify designs that they intended. 
That's not good for your presentation, its design is not good. Nevertheless, the biggest thing is because there is no client sense. I would not say it. Put out things that do not produce sounds.

Does the design ensure White Space (margin) properly? When it is narrow, the element becomes clogged too much and it gets messed up. The vast margins lose their relevance. 
However, securing an appropriate margin results in "cleanliness" in the design.

Do you know why designers prefer Mac rather than Win? 
Although there is the theory that the printing industry has become an industry standard, it is said that there are many built-in fonts that are easy to use for designing. Hiragino etc. are representative. 
Well there are a lot of designers who wanted to take care of them but they bought them! 
I think calmly. Is that element necessary? Will the design break down without that element? If you get lost, throw it away.

Design takes time. "Color arrangement" "Shadow" "Margin" "Typography" "Element" "Discipline" "Specificity" "Delay" "Delicate" "Bold" .... Even just raising it appropriately, there will be contradictory words. That is difficult. I have no choice but to gain experience. 
Let's make it. There is no optimal solution.
