That's it, he's the goddess I will never forget. He always laughed at his disliked appearance but whatever he said, he was my proud godparent compared to all. 
I was bored because i learned a lesson from him that christmas is all about sharing. The only person who gives you something to be happy is that even when he comes home he can not eat but you are the only one you can! Share your blessings. Remember that you just gave it to yourself so you share it. 
TAKE NOTE !! HE YUNG THESE FIRST THAT HAPPENS TO THIS CHRISTMAS. 
Then, I was surprised because he reached me for 100 pesos. I was excited because besides the 100 pesos she gave, she still did not forget me. It's all about her routine every Christmas to give me. 
He never forget to have me his present every Christmas like every year he really gives me. Miski 5 pesos, the remaining 10 pesos in his pocket will reach him. Soon I'll get back to that for a pitcher. He'll still find me 
I do not have a job, a mental illness, but I still have a problem but I always see him uncomfortable. He still could. He is the basketball idol of our street until the life span of his life has dropped. 
So when I call home alone, my brother goes in. "I'm your goddess looking for you" so I'm a little concerned about why we do not seem to be looking for my god ...

Also, see how Koreans are attached to their tv dramas. Valued ang mga filming locations doon. 
 
My point is, their history is well conserved even when tv dramas are appreciated. 
Imagine if Intramuros and other historical sites are fully preserved. 
I mean there are preserved places because in Korea and there are lines of Hanbok for rent which can be used by locals / foreigns in the area. 
It's a great way to preserve other countries like Japan and Korea that they can even go around with Kimono / Hanbok in. In the Philippines, playing outside is a stupid face
