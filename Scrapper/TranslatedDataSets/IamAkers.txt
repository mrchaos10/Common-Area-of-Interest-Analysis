@GarethSimms team turned up tonight!! The return of Megatron!! @LeighDublya your team is fucking me so far! Not good. Unlucky @oWestyo #nfl

@sakerman29 that's my usual mentality! At a few different points the projections had both of us winning by 50+. #KickerVsWR #AkermasWins 
@sakerman29 it's going to be a close finish! If your WR gets 30 points tonight you win the week. #tense 
@sakerman29 what's the most points ever scored by a kicker in ff? #miracleneeded 
@sakerman29 I'm lucky if I get 180 points. Your 2 WR and QB will get 50 without trying! Another loss for The Hail Mary Shotgun Punts! #NFL

@oWestyo @GarethSimms @LeighDublya @sakerman29 I am hoping my game with Steve will be the first time a projected score actually comes true! 
@oWestyo @LeighDublya @GarethSimms @sakerman29 that would be auto pick. On his bench.

@marcflush1 he is a winner. 
@marcflush1 from MarcFlushGamblingLtd? Or a reputable bookie? 
@phatton1875 almost! Alonso must be gutted. Still time for Ramos to fuck someone up! He is pure entertainment for the wrong reasons usually. 
Chelsea will be in the final and will probably win. Being played in Portugal and will be Vs Real Madrid. Made for Jose. #mourinhorevenge 
@phatton1875 but he hasn't had his chance to be a complete cock and get sent off for the 55th time in his career yet! #TalentedWanker

@reid2stevens @matty78 let's forget about Chelsea win deal. I think I will be ok without being noshed off by Phil dressed as #briantherobot

@matty78 @reid2stevens I have the contacts to make it happen! 
@reid2stevens @matty78 read my mind. That's my current #2 fantasy! 
@matty78 @reid2stevens don't worry I will be looking at myself in a mirror 
@reid2stevens @matty78 Utd win, Everton lose. I need Liverpool to lose tomorrow so I can pretend it's the good old days again #victorywank 
@reid2stevens @matty78 Nelson Mandela did blow up a train station and kill a few people mind. #justsayin
