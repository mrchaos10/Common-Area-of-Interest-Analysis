@ banyal_9 Brother, what do I think is a thought-provoking strategy. The central government is being motivated by the formation of mahantgad bond and for the situation like emergency. So that Presidential rule should be imposed and then confuse the public against all the thugs, apes, thieves, scandals, Libertadu, Urban Naxalite, Modi ji. 
@pradeepthakur02 @aajtak @RahulGandhi Universal Basic Income is just an election stunt. It was experimented in Sweden on 2000 people and the findings were very disappointing.

@_groww @vijayshekhar I want you to add features listed in cons. 
I always admires Mr. @vijayshekhar sir for his work. Moreover @_groww people #Ishan #Lalit they guided me in mutual fund investments. 
Want to say thank you team @_groww for your support. 
These are my personal experiences on both platforms, wherever I haven't invested through Paytm but I do use the app for my brother's investments. 
I may be unaware of some things available as I am also a new one in mutual fund investments. 
5/n 
Cons: 
1. Very Limited technical indicators. 
2. Customer Support is not as good. 
3. Not that much information and learning available for novice. 
4. NFO analysis and invest option. 
4/n 
Now @PaytmMoney 
Pro's: 
1. Ratings. (Strongest) 
2. Day of investment analysis 
3. Scheme management's profile 
4. UX in fund investment screen with detailed information. 
5. Goal setting for novice. 
3/n 
Cons: 
1. NFO analysis and invest option only via email. 
2. Watchlist only includes funds. There must be some curated portfolios/ funds collection. 
3. Switching existing regular fund to direct is uneasy. 
4. Earlier on web they included technical indicators but now very few. 
2/n 
Mutual fund platforms: 
@_groww vs @PaytmMoney 
Groww Pro's: 
1. Design your own portfolio with detailed description and analysis. (Strongest point) 
2. Much easier and clean UX 
3. WhatsApp support and guidance 
4. News and Informative daily blogs

@RailMinIndia @RazorpayCare @Razorpay it's you people now. As my bank @TheOfficialSBI says your txn was successful from our side and @RailMinIndia says we didn't received any payment. So it's was your fault. And you people charge for the service, what kind of service is it?

@Samrishi 21 You asked me to lie down. 
@samriddhi21 Same is for laptop batteries. Do remember. 
@samriddhi21 Use battery saver option. Look each battery has a finite number of full cycles i.e. 0% to 100% and from 100% to 0%. Never charge your phone above 90 and never discharge below 10%. Use charging when available. It leads to longer battery life. #Experience.

@samriddhi21 Where exactly in BBMB colony? 
@samriddhi21 I climbed up the wall (timeline) 
@samriddhi21 BBMB colony, Sundernagar. Felt something supernatural that night. And it was winter holidays ongoing. Most of the families were not there. I was alone in that area that night. And even my phone was not working. I cried out of scare. 
@samriddhi21 My left leg. During athletic training in 11th standard. 
@samriddhi21 When my friend's bike got stolen in night in front of my flat in Panchkula. 
@samriddhi21 I am expert in it. When I was in hostel, we used to forget and losing keys and I was called for the game. 
@Summerhyadi21Anna Gee 
@samriddhi21 Haha. Yes, first I made the move. After one hour, they were 6 of them. I was bleeding badly thereafter. 
@samriddhi21 Minor quick fixes. 
@samriddhi21 18th April, 2014. Chandigarh to Kirtpur, then Bilaspur to Sundernagar. I had only 60 rupees in pocket that night, Kirtpur to Bilaspur ticket was 70 rupees. And paid 60 from Kirtpur to Bilaspur at 4 am in morning 
@samriddhi21 I hate them in general. But when I was kid, we had rabbits and white pigeon. 
@samriddhi21 12th December, 2011. Scariest night. 
@samriddhi21 The saddest part of life. Never want to remember that night again. #Nostalgia

I don't think people understand how stressful it is to explain what's going on in your head when you don't even understand it yourself. 
Sometimes you have to stop worrying, wondering, and doubting and just have faith that things will work out. 
“This is my second chance,” he murmurs, his voice stiff with some unnamed emotion. And she was still trying to understand his situation.

Must watch and think 
You read the eyes 
No matter how carefully you choose your words, they'll always end up being twisted by others. 
Two hardest things in life: Letting go when all you really want is to stay and making someone stay when you know they really want to leave. 
Quit caring what people think. Be who you want to be 
Winds remain angry. 
I liked a @YouTube video https://t.co/0ELbNHG0Mz people in facebook named similar to bollywood songs 
Don't ever be afraid to show who you really are, because as long as you are happy with yourself, no one else's opinion matters. 
I’m so good at beginnings, but in the end I always seem to destroy everything, including myself. 
Give yourself permission to cut negative people from your life, and surround yourself with people who bring out the best in you. 
Head up, stay strong. Fake a smile, move on. 
There are some things that cannot be changed and there are some situations where an apology won't be able to change a thing. 
When they see you're doing better without them, that's when they want you back. 
No matter what knocks you down in life, get back up and keep going. Never give up. Great blessings are a result of great perseverance 
Sometimes those who don't socialize much aren't actually anti-social, they just have no tolerance for drama and fake people. 
Consistent progress. Learn and improve every day. You'll always look back and be thankful for the effort that you put into yourself. 
Don't worry about the people that talk behind your back, they're behind you for a reason.

Maturity is when you keep your mouth shut when you want to say something mean to someone. Only people at peace with themselves can do this. 
Time is more valuable than money. You can get more money, but you cannot get more time.

Don't waste your time on weak minds. 
Almost every successful person begins with two beliefs: the future can be better than the present and I have the power to make it so. 
Don't let challenges scare you. Everything you experience is meant to make you stronger and better. You got this?

90% of what's stressing you today will be irrelevant in a year. Don't lose sleep over petty things. Get over it, move on. 
It's amazing how a person who was once just a stranger, can suddenly mean the world to you. 
Life is too short to waste time with people who don't make you happy. Surround yourself with good people, and good things will happen.

Actions speak louder than words. We can apologize over and over, but if our actions don't change, the words become meaningless.

It's painful to say goodbye to someone you don't want to let go, but more painful to ask someone to stay when you know they want to leave. 
Be thankful for the bad things in life. For they open your eyes to the good things you weren't paying attention to before. 
One of the greatest mental freedoms is truly not caring what anyone else thinks of you. 
People think that to be strong is to never feel pain. But in reality, the strongest people are the ones who feel it but get through it! 
A good life is when you smile often, dream big, laugh a lot, and realize how blessed you are for what you have..

Judging others will not make you perfect. 
Look for something positive in each day, even if some days you have to look a little harder. 
Words may sting but silence hurts the most. 
The most attractive thing you can wear is a smile. 
Someday you'll look back on all these days and all this pain is gonna be invisible.

The biggest waste of time and energy is to keep trying to explain something to someone who doesn’t want to hear it. 
Everything happens for a reason, that reason causes change. Sometimes it hurts and sometimes it's hard.But in the end, it's all for the best 
Show respect even to people who don't deserve it, not as a reflection of their character, but as a reflection of yours. 
We blame society, 
 
But we are society. 
Be careful of what you ignore. Sometimes what you ignore is what you need more. 
Judging people won't make you perfect. 
People take you for granted and then wonder why you left. 
The best revenge is to move on, get over it, and continue to succeed. Never give someone the satisfaction of watching you suffer.

@choudharyv @timesofindia but u also have to admit it competition develops peer pressure. Single chance a year increases the pressure. 
@choudharyv @timesofindia I agree wid u 4 equal standards bt look for poor ones who can't attend so called coaching &amp; have single chance 
@choudharyv @timesofindia it also promotes the idea of private coaching institutes. 
@choudharyv @timesofindia but what if student is unable to do well in that single exam? 
Haven't you seen increasing cases in Kota 
@choudharyv @timesofindia the increasing competition 'll devaluate future of some talented students 
@choudharyv @timesofindia earlier students had numerous chances in an year but it'll be reduced nw &amp; pressure on students 'll increase 
@choudharyv @timesofindia if u'll c earlier it was aieee, jee &amp; others were there now it's jee only. Reduced number of opportunities 
Number of opportunities 'll b reduced for each student. Competition 'll b more tougher. Corruption 'll b increased.

70% of people enjoy old songs because of the memories they've attached to them. 
People tend to become silent when angry in order to prevent an argument. 
Lazy people accomplish more. Their laziness actually enables them to find the easiest &amp; quickest ways to get things done. 
Making one person smile can change the world. Maybe not the whole world, but their world.

Listening to music at high volumes can make a person calmer, happier and more relaxed. 
Sometimes you've got to shut up, swallow your pride and accept that you’re wrong. It’s not giving up. It’s called growing up. 
The less you care, the happier you are. 
People often pretend to be happy simply because smiling tends to be easier than explaining to others why they're upset. 
Never ignore a person who loves and cares for you, because one day you may realize that you’ve lost the moon while counting the stars. 
When something bad happens, you have 3 choices: You can either let it define you, destroy you, or let it strengthen you. 
Never lie to someone who trusts you, and never trust someone who lies to you. 
Mistakes are proof that you are trying.

Most of the problems in your life are due to two reasons: you act without thinking, or think without acting. 
Don’t broadcast every high and low of your life. Just live. Don’t try to convince the world you have a life. 
Intelligent men and women are easily annoyed by people in general but tend to say nothing in attempt to avoid meaningless arguments.
