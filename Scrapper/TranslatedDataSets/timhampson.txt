@ebefl There are articles on both sides. https://t.co/EACC1jgCcZ 
@ebefl Race is also a social construct. Irish people weren't considered white for a really long time. In terms of the trains, each of them has different stuff that goes with their ethnicity which I would guess they've picked up from their upbringing. 
This is a good take on Thomas the Tank Engine and I might set this as an example of critical review in class. 
ETHNICITY IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT THAT IS AQUIRED THROUGH SOCIALISATION, CLEARLY SENTIENT TRAINS WOULD HAVE BEEN SOCIALISED AND WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AQUIRE AN ETHNIC IDENTITY OVER TIME BASED ON THE SOCIETY THEY EXISTED IN.

@JeremySchaar Agreed. I usually don't give my own views. Just give it a bit of Socratic method. 
@robshpprd Is it in the replies on there? Couldn't see it (but look forward to). 
I've taken a lot of crap about England's chances of doing well at the World Cup this year, but I'm yet to take crap from someone whose country's team qualified this year so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
I imagine every teacher would be comfortable confronting explicit racism in their classroom. From what I get from this blog post, that'd also be indoctrination; if it is, indoctrinate away. 
because allowing a wrong view to go unchallenged gives tacit legitimacy to that view. 
If you say nothing after a student says "Trump is a great man" that's a political statement in itself. If you say "Well he has this track record of saying racist things and being accused of sexual assault, would that change your mind on his greatness?", it's better... 
There also are some things that are just wrong, and I think it's okay to talk to students about that. I remember getting asked about Trump a lot last year and also had lots of students say good things about him in class.

@DrWilkinsonSci In terms of the guitar, sitting down and rote memorising chords wouldn't mean that you'd have the finger strength to actually play a lot of them. 
@DrWilkinsonSci Don't love this question because I think lots of people who clicked agree might have been thinking of time spent studying as a zero sum game. Time spent memorising does damage creativity if you don't have time to do creative stuff.

There was one plenary in particular that I thought was full of not just knowledge but wisdom. Really inspiring. 
Thing 2: I have been to a reasonable number of conferences now, and sometimes I enjoy them but don't see lots of new stuff. Today was full of interesting new things. Sessions about teacher burnout, the importance of community, feminism in ELT and many other sessions. 
I did a lot of walking around checking up that sessions had started and so got to see numbers in sessions. Things seemed pretty balanced, and the most attended session was one by a female non-native speaker, which is cool!

Head out to complain and skeezy receptionist dude is gone, leaving the whole place for whoever decides to walk in. Mutter "F— this" loudly and leave, call the booking agent and get the heck out of HK. 
The room itself stinks and is too hot &amp; humid. I turn on the aircon and it does nothing. I go over to the bed and the sheets are unchanged. Someone's still wet towel is in my bed. 
I managed to find the one place that hasn't jacked its prices to 70USD a night for a shared room. Doesn't look great, but nothing can go wrong, right?

@seburnt @11thhourspecial @RobertTaylorELT And you cannot lie? 
@seburnt @11thhourspecial @RobertTaylorELT Agreed. I think what Marc and I are saying is that we are people who want them. 
@RobertTaylorELT @seburnt @11thhourspecial .@roberttaylorelt, don't think smaller events will be pushed into obscurity as long as they are innovative and keep putting on a good event. 
@seburnt @11thhourspecial @RobertTaylorELT They do both already exist. I think ELT would be better if we had more small ones and that would also be better for big conferences. 
@11thhourspecial @RobertTaylorELT @seburnt @excitELT I still like and will go to big conferences (hopefully my first JALT in 2018) but small conferences and local events are definitely something that I think the TEFL community needs more of. 
@11thhourspecial @RobertTaylorELT @seburnt The last thing I really like about small conferences is I probably spoke to everyone who came to @excitELT 2017(tried and failed in 2016). 
@11thhourspecial @RobertTaylorELT @seburnt And then also smaller conferences are maybe freer to experiment and promote things too. If you think presentations are too didactic, it's much easier to do something about that at a small conference. If it works, the change can be tried at big conferences too. 
@11thhourspecial @RobertTaylorELT @seburnt This is me on the issue (but of course there is an extensive 'but' coming): https://t.co/i00J8RPkeN 
@11thhourspecial @RobertTaylorELT @seburnt Generally, I think there are some people who are going to small conferences as their first and then moving onto larger ones, that's fine by me. It goes the other way too. 
@11thhourspecial @RobertTaylorELT @seburnt As a small conference organizer, people often assume that there's an us vs them mentality which I don't have. Some people in larger TESOL organizations have made been kind of mean but most of them have been supportive. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

@vaederren If you pour a bucket of water over your head, you're covered in water and wet; if you're underwater you're not wet. Those are clearly two different things. No one feels wet in the pool and fish don't feel wet either. 
RT @vaederren: @timhampson Covered in water = wet, a fish is covered in water I don’t see why this is even a thing I hate everyone 
@vaederren Bad take. 
@vaederren When someone asks 'How's the water?' no one ever says 'Wet.' 
@vaederren If you're swimming, you're not wet till you get out of the pool. 
@vaederren You're not wet till you get out of the water. https://t.co/Y7YTAgyCmE 
@vaederren Is it though? 
IMPORTANT QUESTION: If a fish is swimming in water, is it wet?

@ESLBarry ...of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Barry's existential catchphrase “Alcohol is one hell of a drug” which itself is a cryptic reference to Dave Chapelle. 
@ESLBarry The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about TEACHING. As a consequence people who dislike @ESLBarry truly ARE idiots... 
@ESLBarry To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand @ESLBarry. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of experimental pedagogy, most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head.

@11thhourspecial I sent that one before seeing your reply. Sure you do it very nicely. You are a gentleman and a scholar. 
@11thhourspecial Not only increased clarity of text but using the same colour over all images and builds a stronger identity. #likeaboss 
@11thhourspecial If you want to steal this look, you've got to put a ~60% transparent coloured block over the image with the text on top of that. 
@11thhourspecial I ranted too much and so didn't go into problems with this design (it also seems mean spirited) but you're right. 
@Sarah_TTrainer Kind of flattering, we do put a lot of love into the design for these events though and it'd be nice if this didn't happen. 
@excitELT 35/ If you can also guess the reason it being inspired by that thing, that's at least one more Hitachino. 
@excitELT 34/If you can tell me what the front page of the booklet is a homage to, you get a free Hitachino Nest. Unofficial beer of excicitELT Tokyo. https://t.co/J0Ooy6JnJv 
32/ If you want someone to be incredibly nerdy about ELT and graphic design for you, please check out @excitELT or https://t.co/7BPK57nJs7. 
31/ Anyhow most of the point here is to share some of the work that goes into design and some of the cool things we sneak in there. 
30/ But I don't want to get the look taken because that doesn't benefit anyone. I saw that poster &amp; thought it was announcing excitelt 3. 
29/ I'm also really happy for other conferences to take ideas like the posters not booklets thing or even the blank space layout. 
28/ I'm very happy that people don't notice this stuff because it still makes the conference better and these details make the difference. 
26/ And I kind of hope people can somehow feel that we put in a lot of love, even though they'll never know about the obscure homages... 
24/ Not because they're rude, but because they probably didn't notice. 
23/ The point is this: no one really said 'oh you've obviously spent a day typesetting this booklet or thinking about posters' to me. 
22/ Booklets are distracting and the posters became a congregation point between sessions. We did this to make the conference more social. 
21/ We also didn't hand out paper conference booklets; we had prominently displayed A2 posters instead. More a design than a budget choice. 
20/ We only used Futura for the whole document but the hierarchies of information are incredibly clear and I'm really proud of how it looks. 
19/ I spent ages realising the numbers should be red and also making the headers work. 
18/ It didn't look quite right till I made the numbers in the bottom left red. Somehow this balances the page a lot more. 
17/ It's a deliberate design decision to make it easy to find sessions. It took me 3/4 hours testing layouts to find this one. 
16/ Look at the conference where the sessions are and see and all the blank space on the left next to the names. 
15/ The question people always ask at conferences is "What's on next?" so the time periods are in columns not rows: you read left to right. 
14/Designing a conference booklet's typesetting takes ages because people are often spending a lot of time looking for specific info. 
13/ The red for the excitELT Tokyo conference came from the Japanese flag. I really hope people guessed this one. 
11/ It seemed like a cool homage to an album that seems freaky and modern 39 years after it's release. #excitELTsquadgoals 
10.5/ This might actually be Extra Bold Italic. 
 
https://t.co/Y1azi7vrtP 
9/ excitELT fact even @AnnLoseva doesn't know: Futura Bold ended up being used because I was listening to Japanese Citypop. 
@LanguageOnion @hallg 8/ For excitELT Tokyo I wanted a more dynamic font. I remember spending a day looking at fonts online and nothing really worked. 
7/ True fact I don't even think @LanguageOnion or @hallg know: The excitELT Seoul purple is taken from a hanbok dress. 
5. We kept the text over cityscape thing from Seoul, but we also kept the idea of the colour being linked to the location. 
4/We changed a bunch of the design stuff from excitELT Seoul. The biggest reason for this was that I got good at design between conferences. 
3/ Going on a Twitter rant/Tweetstorm about the design process for excitELT Tokyo. Niche area, but I'll be sharing some stuff no one knows. 
2/ Is this a really small thing to get mad over? For comparison please check out the excitELT conference booklet. https://t.co/Mf9xt3ghyA

When you have no time to plan, it's way harder to be 'chalk and talk' and much easier to be student centred. 
There's this thing where teachers are like "Oh I spent 8 hour preparing this class I'm going to use once". 
To be honest you probably don't have any other obligation to be anything more than pretty decent at your job.
