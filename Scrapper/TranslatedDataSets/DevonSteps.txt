@IngKwabz @KSM_Kwaku_Misa That’s where you got it all wrong. When in the history of the NDC did you see the party use its vigilante group to molest &amp; undermine rule of law? Gimme one instance &amp; I’ll concede

For now I’ll entreat everyone to remain calm, let’s work hard to wrestle power from them then we take it from there! 
@KSM_Kwaku_Misa @KomiteeMember I was with some police men today &amp; I heard them say they pray what happened today at ayawaso happens in 2020 so that they can get some monies out of it. I don’t know how &amp; I didn’t ask either cos I was surprised &amp; dumbfounded by what I heard. That’s the country in which we live! 
@KomiteeMember @KSM_Kwaku_Misa Even the media is afraid. Only God can &amp; will save Ghana from these cabals called Invicible forces!

They wanna go the by the books. In a way, I’m happy the npp is teaching em how to use power, so when they get the opportunity to win political power again, they know how to use it. 
If twins can even kill themselves then… 
@KomiteeMember @KSM_Kwaku_Misa Hmmm. Isn’t it surprising?? How can a whole Christian council take “sides”? 
Seems to me they were all against mahama if not NDC as a political party! 
@KSM_Kwaku_Misa Very sad but hopefully they’ll find their voices sooner rather than later! Else we’re doomed as a country! 
@KSM_Kwaku_Misa Say that again. What scares me most is the deafening silence of the relevant bodies(Christian council, occupyGhana) &amp; the likes who some years back were very vociferous when these kind of things happened. But today what do we see, they’re all silent &amp; it feels like they’re scared 
@KSM_Kwaku_Misa They’re not police men pls. They’re the president’s invicible forces clad in security attires, with sole purpose of causing mayhem at the command of Nana Addo.

@myfootballtrial @ManUtdChannel @moutune I can’t talk for the other guys cos I don’t follow them that much But I know sarri got his midfield target Jorginho. His 1st choice midfielder. But what was given Jose?That’s the issue! Get him his 1st choice players then you have the right to criticize him when he doesn’t do it 
@myfootballtrial @ManUtdChannel @moutune Jorginho doesn't play for utd sir! Sanchez has been playing shit since he came &amp; that’s not the managers fault bro! 
@JaySpearingFC @utdxtra @michaelowen He gave him the chance to take &amp; he didn’t take it. Look at it from that angle! 
@JaySpearingFC @utdxtra @michaelowen Yh. But he started him! Or it doesn’t count huh? 
@myfootballtrial @ManUtdChannel @moutune It’s not about errors here. It’s about the backing. There’s no need keeping Jose if you can’t back him in the transfer market. Dude spent the whole summer complaining about his defensive options but what did the club do about it?? Absolutely nothing! 
@myfootballtrial @ManUtdChannel @moutune He gives options of 4 in every position. The clubs gets him what they want! Like Matic, he wanted Dier but he was given Matic. Is that his fault?? C’mon. The club should be getting the manager his A list players. His first choice players! That’s no fault of Jose 
@JaySpearingFC @utdxtra @michaelowen Rarely?? He played against Valencia on Wednesday mate. Pls come again! I’m sure his match day starts are even more than that of Fabinho! 
@IngKwabz @utdxtra @michaelowen @GNev2 You bab. That’s what the utd fans want 
@JaySpearingFC @utdxtra @michaelowen For how long has he been sitting on the bench before the game yesterday? 
@myfootballtrial @ManUtdChannel @moutune Did it work out?? What happened afterwards?? That’s what we talking about!
