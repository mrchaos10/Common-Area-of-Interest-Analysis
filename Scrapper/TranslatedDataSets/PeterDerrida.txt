@HunterWilkes11 @BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Who created the confusion of different languages at Babel? 
@HunterWilkes11 @BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I'm referring to Luke 15. The Pharisees show up and start acting like haters so Jesus tells the Parable of the Lost Sheep, then the Parable of the Lost Coin, and then the Parable of the Prodigal Son. 
@HunterWilkes11 @BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Well the point of the parables was to confuse the lost people when Jesus spoke in front of large groups. Jesus begins a set of sermons in which only the first was called a parable, but the others were clearly in that format as well. 
@BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word The Parable of the Great Banquet in Luke 14 doesn't call itself a parable, but the parallel in Matthew 22 calls itself a parable. Does this create a problem for the hyperliteral method? 
@HunterWilkes11 @BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word So if the purpose of the parables was to conceal a deeper message from those on the outside, would those on the outside have understood the Prodigal Son? 
@ HunterWilkes11 @BWSchank @ christislifted1 @ sonofDaVid512 @ adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word What was the point? 
@BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word If this is not allegorical, what is the point? Jesus is just getting up before people and announcing some odd current events of the time for no real reason? 
@BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word How much clearer does he have to be? The Parable of the Great Banquet is a parable. It has all of the elements of a parable. Jesus trusts that you to have the brain cells to realize it with out it being spelled out for you like a child. 
@BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word In Luke 15, Jesus did not announce that he was telling a parable when he told the Parable of the Prodigal Son. Was that not a parable? 
@BWSchank @christislifted1 @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word He did not say the Good Samaritan was a parable. Do you deny that it was a parable based simply on the fact that Jesus did not spell it out for you? 
@christislifted1 @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I don't think he understands death in a non-hyper literal sense. To speak in any other way is to engage in allegory and he doesn't believe in that. I don't think he believes in interpreting parables as parables either.

Thinking like an ancient Israelite after being so conditioned by modernism and scientism and rationalism etc., etc., does not come naturally to us.

In the Jewish mindset 40 was not one more than 39 or one less than 41. 40 is 40 because 40 is special.

Culturally speaking, Jews generally regarded 40 years as a generation, because 40 was a highly symbolic number in their culture.

@Lex_Lutheran Having said that, I suppose the "suck it up buttercup" types might be confined to a particular cultural generation. All of my WWII era working-class relatives were not particularly big on public grieving. It was actually taboo. 
@Lex_Lutheran It wouldn't be smart to go up to someone in the anger stage of grief and say "accept that this is God's will or else you're an open theist heretic!" It is a product of wisdom. 
@Lex_Lutheran Bad things happen. Even secular psychologists believe that the final stage of the grieving process is acceptance. I don't know what the secularist bases that acceptance on, but as Christians we have God's sovereignty. 
@Lex_Lutheran This is seems to be more of a pastoral issue, which might vary from person to person and issue to issue. Some people hear "it wasn't meant to be" and find comfort. Others don't. Some hear "suck it up buttercup" and they find it insensitive. Others hear it and find strength.

@RScottClark @DavidBancz @rachelgmiller97 @eperry2011 Like I said, I am a new Christian (a little over a year) and I am still working through these issues. I cannot express how much I appreciate the dialogue. It has been food for thought. 
@RScottClark @DavidBancz @rachelgmiller97 @eperry2011 I am not familiar with name in that group. It seems to be a code for liberal, almost revolutionary and what little I know about Kuyper is antithetical to that. My concern is that because we have what appears to be a polemical allusion by Paul to NL does that require synthesis? 
@RScottClark @DavidBancz @rachelgmiller97 @eperry2011 More as a product of the history of ideas. The fact that people cannot agree about what it actually constitutes outside of Christian assumptions points to it being a product of worldview. The Stoics spoke of it. Paul seems to allude to it but he considered their thinking futile 
@RScottClark @DavidBancz @rachelgmiller97 @eperry2011 I suppose it depends on how much the truth is suppressed and how much they have become futile in their thinking. 
@RScottClark @DavidBancz @rachelgmiller97 @eperry2011 Natural law seems like a fine concept in a Christian society with similar cultural assumptions which can be taken as natural, but look at historical anthropology: what is considered natural varies more than drastically. Being "given over" is not super rare 
@DavidBancz @RScottClark @rachelgmiller97 @eperry2011 I thought Van Til and the postmods destroyed that concept beyond repair. A Christian has a different understanding of the "natural" compared to the Stoic or the Aztec or the LGBT activist or the racist slave owner.

@elencticae @drantbradley @machenwarrior @michaelkelley It wasn't my intention to come across as a know it all. I've only been a Christian for a little over a year, but I've dove into the writings. From what I've gathered the laissez faire amillennial attitude towards things outside the church is not classic reformed thought. 
@elencticae @drantbradley @machenwarrior @michaelkelley Wow that was escalated quickly. I was not talking about neo-Kuyperians. I was talking about the diagram. I raised the question: Did Puritan theology have an impact on their attitudes towards labor, commerce, politics, arts, family, etc. or was their faith hermetically sealed? 
@elencticae @drantbradley @machenwarrior @michaelkelley If the Puritans were into making diagrams, how different would their diagram be from the above diagram? They weren't apathetic amillennialists focused exclusively on personal piety.

@chuck_finney @ThomasCoutouzis It's generic leftism dressed up in postmillennial verbiage. In a follow up Tweet he gives a specific example of the "just preach the gospel" Christians: it was an IFB group who wasn't calling for "just preaching the gospel," they were calling for Mosaic Law. 
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word They had to worship YAHWEH in the way prescribed. 
@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word They had to live by the Old Covenant. They couldn't change their DNA or join a tribe, and if they wanted to reject the Pharisees' incorrect interpretations of the law, then that would be fine as well. 
@sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word I believe that people are not being inspired with special revelation in the ways they were when scripture was being written. 
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word Did you get a prophecy about that from your imagination? 
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word If revelation didn't stop there would be more scripture. 
@machenwarrior So in his vision people should focus on fighting inequality without exerting much emphasis on spreading the gospel and certainly not investing any efforts on reducing clearly defined immorality. It sounds like generic liberalism dressed up in postmillennial verbiage. 
@machenwarrior So if I understand this correctly, GCC means people who just want to preach the gospel and make no social change as well as people who want to crush social evil on earth in a way described in God's Law. Is the problem their understanding of kingdom doesn't equal his politics? 
@machenwarrior He called GCC a truncated view that focuses solely on gospel spreading rather than fighting evil. Well in a subsequent tweet he gave a specific example of GCC: an IFB who wasn't talking about just gospel preaching. IFB guy wanted Mosaic capital offense laws. This is confusing! 
@sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark For other people who were not as invested in hating God as I was, this process can happen pretty quickly. It could be something as simple as turning to a Christian radio channel that you normally skip over but because of regeneration you become intrigued and hungry. 
@sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark I'll give an example from my case. I openly hated God with a passion, but unbeknown to me I was regenerated and my heart started to soften and become alive. I went from "I hate God" to "maybe I've been wrong but probably not" to "I was very very wrong" to "God is great!" etc 
@sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark We define regeneration as the means by which a person goes from a state of hating God to a state of loving God and proclaiming faith. Regeneration is very subtle and subconscious. Most people don't even realize it is happening to them. 
@sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark I think I understand where things are getting confusing. Quite often people mistake regeneration with sanctification. They aren't the same thing. 
@drantbradley I'm confused. I thought your critique of GCC was that it neglected our responsibility that "evil needs to be purged" for "a cosmic redemptive eschatological hope for the new earth." Is there adultery on the new earth?

@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word How could someone write scripture after the closing of the era announcing that the era had closed? 
@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word I said by 70 AD because that's when I believe that the canon of scripture was closed and the critical era of revelation history had closed.

@adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word I'm sorry but you need to understand biblical theology.

@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word What does scripture say? Jesus said to pray like this: “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven...." not like "babababbabababa" 
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word Moses came with a new revelation and he performed signs. Jesus came with a new revelation and he performed signs. The apostles brought that new revelation and they performed signs. Did you notice the number of signs dropping as the NT proceeded? 
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @sonofDaVid512 @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Standing_Word Scripture doesn't really speak of miracles in the originals.

@thatbrian @clbolt I have noticed PCA varies from local to local. There are 4 in my county. Each one has its own flavor. I figured it isn't unique to here or the PCA, eg, I know PCUSA congregations way more conservative than some PCA congregations. 
@clockt OPC 
Reformed Episcopal Church 
@southernevange1 "I've been on five continents and several countries" 
How does that work? 
@XpCoulson @RScottClark Yep. I should also mention that the RPCUSA who is openly theonomic was the first to jump into action about the Fed Vis controversy stating the Westminster standards and calling for repentance. It was swift. It was on point. It wasn't mixed up with a bunch of other baggage. 
@XpCoulson As I understand it, things went nuts in the PCA. The Billy Graham type evangelicals freaked out over a higher view of the sacraments and "elitism". The 2K amils freaked out because they equated FV as the new face of their true enemy: (not the secular humanists) postmil theonomy 
@XpCoulson No Baptist here. I attend an OP church. The OPC did not spin out of control over FV. It was determined that the FVists and New Perspective on Paul had some very valid points to make although "aberrant views on justification have been promulgated from within these circles" 
@XpCoulson That probably points to my ignorance of what happened. It might explain the hesitance to engage in another, probably bigger fight. For my part I probably cut some of the FV crowd extra slack because I really like some of their thought provoking work on typology. 
@XpCoulson Like I said, I'm a new convert so that has certain downsides (ignorance) and certain insights (fresh eyes), and I can't help but notice what gets people institutionally riled up and what doesn't. What would you find if you really looked at the woke view of justification? 
@XpCoulson I read the OPC report. If I recall correctly it got much more heated in the PCA so I might check that out, but my suspicion has not been that it was overtly about postmil, which has been deemed a legit view. Thus people don't go after each other explicitly on those grounds. 
@thatbrian @XpCoulson @PresbyPolemics One more clarification: Let's imagine that Van Til was postmill. I'm not saying that people would have gone after Van Til for being postmill. I'm saying that if Van Til was postmill they would have gone after him for his idiosyncratic articulation of the Trinity. 
@EvenWokerPresby Not just silent though. Paul Woolley, who was there at Westminster Seminary's founding as the leading church historian, who was there with Machen for the OPC's founding, was adamantly pro-abortion and called an unborn child an "entity" and "abstraction" 
@EvenWokerPresby This is something uncomfortable to talk about, but all the amill institutions were silent too. As far as I know nobody in the reformed world even attempted to address the issue until the postmill resurgence. 
@EvenWokerPresby They felt it was wrong to get involved in issues of justice because we are just passing through this life with our eyes fixed on heavenly spiritual things. The world was going to inevitably keep getting worse so why polish the brass on a sinking ship?

@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word Well Satan is evil so he does evil

@BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word God struck down Corinthians for abusing the supper. God struck down Ananias and Sapphira for betraying their baptism. With much blessings come with potential curses. 
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @PresbyPolemics @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Can you be more specific? 
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Sanctification is progressive. I know some people in the hyper grace/dispensationalist camp who reject say sanctification is optional and progressive sanctification is pointless "sin management"

@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Pagan chance filled the vacuum of pagan gods. These thinkers thought the gods were too distant to care 
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word They believed in a non personal force called fate. As pagans started questioning their gods as superstition the y embraced chance. These were the philosophers 
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @ adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @ PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word It means the same thing 
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I did not call Solomon a story teller. I was referring to Jesus' parable 
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Chaos is a pagan concept, especially, I cannot emphasize this enough, in their creation myths. The biblical account lacks this element of chaos 
 
The lot is cast into the lap, 
but its every decision is from the Lord. 
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Chance is a pagan concept that pagan scientists cannot even prove. Chance is just stuff we are ignorant about 
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word God says the casting of lots is not random because nothing is. Now if something appears random, chance, coincidental to us that is just because we are ignorant 
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Chance is not a biblical concept, nor coincidence 
@BWSchank @ReadMoreBible @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word That word appears twice and points to an occurrence 
@ReadMoreBible @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word It does not matter that it only is used in a made up story and appears to be a story teller technique and happens once so we have no clear idea of how it was conceptualized outside of studying its use among pagans 
@BWSchank @ReadMoreBible @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word It appears once. You argument is with Strong's

@BWSchank @ReadMoreBible @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word You mean the word that appears only once in scripture?

@BWSchank @ReadMoreBible @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word So the Apostle John was a bad writer for saying he was? 
@BWSchank @ReadMoreBible @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Why do you bring up the hypothetical? What happened was always going to happen. 
@BWSchank @ReadMoreBible @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word The Apostle John wrote during the tribulation. Why do you not believe him?

@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Is he the guy who murdered his two kids and killed himself?

@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I've read dispensationalist authors to know what you guys believe. There wasn't a moment where I felt like I was contracted a disease by looking at it. Are you afraid? 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word We're talking about literacy, not uncritically accepting everything someone says. Do you see the difference? 
@higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word There is a tendency in independent fundamentalist circles to be afraid of being polluted by books and pride in saying you've never heard of an author. 
@rachelgmiller97 There is a belief that the Quran is a fringe Christian lectionary  in Arabic that was heavily edited so when you look at the Quran there's two layers of text. Higher criticism of the Quran is a touchy subject as you can imagine. 
@BWSchank @PresbyPolemics @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Listen, I don't pretend to know their situations, but come come on. I just listed the main dispensationalists and they have the same problems. They don't believe in covenants because they are antinomians. Ideas have consequences. 
@BWSchank @PresbyPolemics @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I wouldn't say unpardonable, but by the fourth marriage do they even have a category of sin for this that applies to them? Who are they? Are they unbelievers in the entertainment industry or are they supposed men of God? 
@PresbyPolemics @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word LOL dispensationalists generally are kinda wild, especially when it comes to rightly dividing their marriages. Ruckman with three wives. Hal Lindsey four wives. C. I. Scofield abandoned his first family and remarried. John Hagee ditched his first wife. COVENANTS ARE FOR THE JEWS! 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Josh, although I strongly disagree with him, is relatively level-headed guy by dispensationalist standards. Ruckman is a madman. 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word How would you know if you are completely ignorant of their works as you say? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Same here. He acts like he's only ever read one book and he just happens to parrot what all these other well-selling dispensationalists say word for word by total coincidence 
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @ sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @ adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word THANK YOU! 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I know the dispensationalist position fairly well. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word A simple look at history shows that it was only not everlasting the sense that we tend to think of the term everlasting. How is being booted from the land for 1900 years everlasting? 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word The Church is not literal Israel in every conceivable sense of the word, but nobody actually claims that anyhow. Nobody is entitled to the older covenants. They are outdated. I don't know what promises you're talking about. Being the womb of the Messiah? We're not waiting. 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @TylerMarkJ @adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Yep. That's why you guys call it a secret rapture. Don't act confused when we speak of it in those terms. 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @TylerMarkJ @ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word The tree is God's covenant community unto salvation. (There's one God with one people with one plan.) The apostates who rejected Christ were branches torn off the covenant tree. Believing gentiles were grafted in. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Dispensationalists call it a secret rapture, like a thief in the night they say 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Wow God is going to set their enemies against them for that. Not smart. 
@ adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @ sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @ PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word You misunderstand me. 
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Sanctification is part of the grace package. It is a gift from God. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word My confession does not mention the TR 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @sonofDaVid512 @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word For real? Do you have a credible source, ie, not some prophesy watcher site 
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @sonofDaVid512 @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I asked him to look it up months ago. He has that prideful ignorance you often see in independent fundamentalists. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word "In the Septuagint the word berith is rendered diatheke in every passage where it occurs with the exception of Deut. 9:15 (marturion) and I Kings 11:11 (entole). " Louis Berkhof, Systematic Theology 
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Imagine being a NT writer and you want to communicate the idea of covenant to your audience. What would you do? Go to the Septuagint and see how it talks about covenant. You'd see diatheke so you use it. Then imagine people twisting your words to not mean covenant. :( 
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I'm not trying to be rude, but antinomianism is rampant among dispensationalists, who tend to view sanctification as being an optional part of salvation that might only touch super-disciples, who many accuse of just showing off. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away. 
This already happened

@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word diatheke is how the LXX translates the Hebrew word berith (covenant) 
@ThaRealJgibbs @ sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @ adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @ PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word diatheke is covenant 
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Reformed people do not see themselves as Israel in every sense of the word. We speak symbolically in covenantal terms set by the New Covenant. God has one people not based on DNA but by covenant. We are spiritual heirs of Abraham, not by blood, but by covenant 
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word So are you one of those people who thinks covenants are just for THE JEWS and  non-Jews can just be antinomian and live like heathens because they just need a personal relationship with sweet baby Jesus? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word There is a spot in Hebrews were there is some word play by the author where there is double meaning being expressed but our God is essentially covenantal. Jesus did not change that 
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word If you mean a testimony (collection of writings) of the covenant then fine, but dispensationalists do not mean that. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word The word means covenant. It is a major thematic concept of the entire arc of scripture. To play with the language so to confuse this is to do violence to God's word. Jeremiah was not plaing. Daniel was not playing. Jesus was not playing. Our God is covenantal 
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word Are you talking about the KJV? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word If that is so they were not being faithful to the Greek 
@ThaRealJgibbs @sonofDaVid512 @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I believe that it is misleadingly translated by the Catholics and Anglicans as Testament but the word is covenant

@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word I have been trying to get him to answer those questions since I first started talking to him. Good luck! 
@BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word You have wacky interpretation of those verses too 
@BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word You are adding stuff to what John wrote 
@ThaRealJgibbs @TylerMarkJ @BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word They are Paul-Onlyists so they just try to find something that says the same thing in Paul even though the continuity undermines their claims of radical discontinuity. 
@DerBettler @Lex_Lutheran @brandon_adams @bkben3 I'm not trying to be rude, but if unity was the goal what's the point of getting so close? 
@DerBettler @Lex_Lutheran @brandon_adams @bkben3 Is it too much to ask to baptize your kids into the covenant and have some authority above the congregation? 
@BWSchank @TylerMarkJ @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @adrianturner01 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word It's not "first to the Jews and then something completely radically different and distinct and discontinuous to everyone else" 
RT @reformedforum: Carl Trueman speaks about the basic contours of the Marburg Colloquy, a key meeting among Protestants during the Reforma… 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs The Holy Spirit is there guiding you and keeping you from permanently falling away, but that means you're no longer autonomous. 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Is God making saved people puppets by keeping them from falling away? Isn't that some violation of human rights or something? 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs I agree 100%! So where's the autonomous free will in all that? 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Because scripture assumed that people would understand that Saul was under God's judgment. 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs For me, I believe that God providentially ensures that His people persevere. This is not a problem for me because I do not have a free will fetish. The Arminians are at least consistent on this issue. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Saul was not sealed. He was an enemy of God. We sing psalms about God graciously crushing Saul, the chief enemy of David. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Saul was a type of antichrist! How many of David's psalms are likely about how God is going to crush Saul for eternity? 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Can they lose their faith and keep their salvation? 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Saul was under God's wrath. You're making a big deal about a tiny phrase that clearly indicates that Saul was about to meet his maker. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Samuel said, “Why do you consult me, now that the Lord has departed from you and become your enemy? 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Saul was a demonically cursed individual who engaged in a capital offense without any repentance and committed suicide. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Why do you assume that Samuel was saying anything more than soon you're going to die? 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs What does it say? What does it not say? 
@JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs I'm talking about a man who became a Satanist. He gave his soul to the devil. He engaged in Satanic rituals. God struck him down in the middle of one. This is all shades of grey to you? 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Does it really make a difference if he made a profession of faith? Does it mean that he can renounce it and put himself under the headship of Satan with no consequences? 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Yeah, in the realm of the dead. 
@JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs The inner man wanted to go to a Satanic orgy and God struck him down in the middle of it. What else do you need to know? 
@JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Another question: once the Holy Spirit indwells a believer, does the believer lose his free will to become a Satanist until the day he dies? 
@JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs OR did he just lose some of his rewards? 
@JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Would I be a "fruit inspector" for saying that the guy who had a heart attack in the middle of a Satanic orgy probably wasn't saved to begin with? 
@ PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs But but but but but OSAS? 
@JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs I wish I could find the quote and the source of the quote, but I have heard people from your camp saying something along the lines of there are people who could have died in the middle of performing a Satanic ritual who go to heaven because they once had faith. 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs What about through their own free will? Did they lose that when they became a believer? 
@JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs I'm not saying that it does include you. Your camp is the camp saying that perseverance is not necessary, meaning that apostasy is okay. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs People don't have the free will to exit? 
@JeffPassage @ adrianturner01 @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @ PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Falling away from the faith. 
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 2. 70 years was a symbolic number in the prophetic idiom and the difference between the prophets and the historical records are irrelevant. 
 
Now these are the two orthodox possibilities. I am open to either one, but option one has some work to do. 
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 There are two possible orthodox answers. 
 
1. The hyper-literalists are correct in this one instance: the Babylonian captivity lasted precisely 70 years and every single Babylonian record is incredibly wrong, not by a couple of years but by decades. 
@adrianturner01 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs If you do not persevere , endure, finish the race and you die outside the faith then you get nothing

RT @RevLouisBerkhof: God’s providences, both favorable and adverse, are often powerful means of sanctification. 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @dispensational @higham_mark The Apostle Paul commended his readers for testing what he said in comparison with other scripture. He was not a Paul-Onlyist. He saw continuity between what he was saying and the whole council of God. 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @dispensational @higham_mark Paul who? 
@JeffPassage @dispensational @higham_mark I have not purchased this book and I have read many of the early writings and there is no way to honestly present them as dispensationalists. It's actually laughable. 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs It's not too hard. Just admit it. You don't have the answers. Say you'll give it some more thought. It's okay 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Like I said: you're being evasive. If you can't answer the question directly, then just say so. 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs You are playing games right now. You don't like these questions because you want two contradictory things to be true at the same time. This cannot be the case so you're being slippery. 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs He did not answer my question at all. He went off on a totally different side road. Let me ask again: are you persevering in the faith? Do you have the free will to not persevere in the faith? 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Okay this is a joke. Let me know when you are going to stop playing games. 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs I'm guessing that you know my answer, but I'm also guessing that you guys will do what you always do when this question comes up: you will try to run away and not being direct. I'm asking you to be direct. Is that asking too much? 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @ adrianturner01 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @ PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs I asked first 
@BWSchank @adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs So what you're saying is that you are persevering and you can't even use your precious free will to separate yourself from God. Is this correct? 
@BWSchank @adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs I'm not asking you if you are focusing your mind on persevering. I'm asking you if you are in fact persevering. To not persevere is to walk away from Christ. Does that describe you? 
@BWSchank @ adrianturner01 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @ PaulsWalls2 @Standing_Word @ThaRealJgibbs Are you not persevering?

@Riaannels @BWSchank @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @ejioforkel @PTerrone1986 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @NahumOBrien I do not know if you understand the position. When they speak of the evil against the church, they aren't talking about snow on a Sunday. They are talking about people. 
@pseudoABoethius @seansgame If it were the typical Christian Entertainment Industry film it would have been all about How Ethan Got His Groove Back, but instead it was about how Ethan found a substitute religion (politics), embraced justification by (political) works, and self destructed. 
@pseudoABoethius @seansgame The falling away happened before the film even began. The main character admitted to being incapable of praying. A minister incapable of praying can't perform his office. 
@pseudoABoethius @seansgame Well art is subjective. But the theme was apostasy. The HC was the furthest thing from his mind. It was recited as a lackluster reenactment 
@pseudoABoethius @seansgame It was. The filmmaker grew up reformed. Went to Calvin College. Became an apostate. It is a look at him in a way as well 
@pseudoABoethius @seansgame He completely gave up on reformed thought if he ever believed it in the first place. He had to justify himself. The director went to Calvin College so he knew what he was bringing up and not bringing up 
@pseudoABoethius @seansgame They called the church a museum because it was and the main character was like a historical actor like at colonial Williamsburg. He didn't believe it. It was boring to him so when a trendy political issue came up he dove in 100% 
@pseudoABoethius @seansgame I agree. I took it as historic reformed theology in the northeast dying like the main character. It was just going through the motions like a Civil War reenactment 
@pseudoABoethius @seansgame I think it was great. I liked how it did not try to do what most Christian films do: everyone gets saved!!! It was vacuous because most of Christianity is vacuous. Ethan lost faith and became obsessed with politics. Sound familiar?

@higham_mark @ejioforkel @PaulsWalls2 @PTerrone1986 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien This is 100% correct. If he wanted us to know he would have mentioned it. Everyone, no matter how confident, is just speculating. The point is that the two witnesses are part of the covenantal lawsuit against apostate Israel. 
@ejioforkel @BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien You have presented texts that you fail to see the deepness of. You interpret it at the most superficial level which you (not just you, but all dispensationalists) fancy as the most God honoring, literal sense 
@ejioforkel @BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien That's because Jesus like every single person in scripture was not a wooden literalist! Please, please, please understand this point. You are dishonoring the text by reading it as hyper literal. John was a TYPE of Elijah. 
@ejioforkel @BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien If you think Elijah's spirit was literally in John the Baptist then you believe in reincarnation. 
@ejioforkel @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien People from all over the Roman Empire came to feast their eyes on the temple. It was one of the major wonders of the world. 
@ejioforkel @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien Ezekiel was in exile and God said the exile would end and they would return to the land and build the second temple. He was given a symbolic vision as a sign of God's faithfulness to His promises. It was the second temple. 
@ejioforkel @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien Jesus confirmed a new covenant and was cut off making the sacrifice and the oblation obsolete, and before his death he cursed that wicked, abominable, demonically possessed generation and vengeance was poured out on to them.

If you're an apostate it doesn't matter what your DNA is. You're out. My "replacement theology" is the new covenant. The other one was smashed. 
@ejioforkel @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien You missed the bus. Daniel's 70th week happened about 2000 years ago. 
@JeffPassage @ejioforkel @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @NahumOBrien They are the remnant that entered the Church, which is True Israel. 
@machenwarrior The atonement and the mustard seed are distinct ideas, right? 
@MascotUr @lisasharper I'm sorry you feel that way. Peace. 
@MascotUr @lisasharper Cool. It's a cool song. I'm not knocking it, but like everything it belongs in a proper context. Singing patriotic American songs at American sporting events is one thing. Going up in a foreigners face and singing the National Anthem is something entirely different. 
@MascotUr @lisasharper I'm not some dude making stuff up. I learned this in grad school. It's a variation on a custom that goes back centuries. What means to imply is we (i.e., all native people) are united as one against you (the boy in MAGA hat and by extension his entire group). 
@MascotUr @lisasharper LOL the song is supposed to be sung together to foster unity among the various native nations. Banging it in a non-native face is provocative. If this is news to you go ask your elders. 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ejioforkel @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien There's an earthly kingdom for everyone. We're in it right now. Christ is putting his enemies under his feet. He has dominion. We have a commission. It is spiritual/heavenly and on earth.

I'm sorry you have a bad translation :( 
@MascotUr @lisasharper Now if you are native, and not some white person with guilt to atone for, you would know what song it is and you would know perfectly well that banging a drum in the face of a white boy while singing the American Indian Movement song is not a friendly gesture. 
@higham_mark @ejioforkel @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @ pbcmike98 @BWSchank @ PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @ PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien Same to you! 
@higham_mark @ejioforkel @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @pbcmike98 @BWSchank @PTerrone1986 @Riaannels @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien All the Paul-Onlyists/Mid-Acts Dispensationalists never want to address Acts 28: He lived there two whole years at his own expense, and welcomed all who came to him, proclaiming the KINGDOM OF GOD and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance. 
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 It proved Jesus wasn't a false prophet and the Old Covenant was over. 
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 What year did it start? What year did it end? Does the number equal 70? You're assuming that Daniel has the same modern western understanding of numbers as you do. 
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I asked for the math where two years are provided and the difference between the two is exactly 70. 
@kanyabwile Do you understand the cultural significance of beating a drum in the face of someone while singing the AIM (American Indian Movement) chant? Under no conceivable circumstance could it not be considered incredibly provocative. That boy was ritualistically dunked on. 
@ PaulsWalls2 @ adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 Are you referring to Acts 16? 
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I'll see if I can my hands on it 
@ PaulsWalls2 @ adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 No 
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It was the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty 
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The Roman empire collapsed during this time. 
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The New Covenant was an earthquake stronger than any other since man was on the earth 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Well if that's the case stop calling yourself a Christian. Christ = Messiah. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Now do you understand the difference between a prophetic vision described in the prophetic idiom and the historical accounts of Titus destroying the second temple? 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 But did WWII happen before the second temple was destroyed? 
@ PaulsWalls2 @ adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 * "there" = Dali Museum 
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Well here's a warning: what you're going to see there might look as realistic in form as a Rembrandt, but it's in a different genre that uses symbolism and you shouldn't look at a Dali the same way you look at a Rembrandt 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The bible says Jesus is the door. Chew on that with your wooden literalism. 
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Wow, I'd like to show you some Salvador Dali paintings and see if your head explodes 
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The Messiah, the Prince, came and cut a new covenant with many and with his own sacrifice put an end to the old sacrificial system and his body was an atonement for sin. Then the second temple was destroyed. How is this not clear? 
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 No you do not take the bible literally because if you took the bible literally then you would not read the prophetic idiom like the encyclopedia. 
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Internal evidence point to the second temple still standing. External evidence point to the time of Nero 
@PaulsWalls2 @adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Do you really think the moon is going to turn into blood? 
@ PaulsWalls2 @ adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 Yes they did. 
@ PaulsWalls2 @ adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 I agree. 
@ PaulsWalls2 @ adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 Irenaeus is wrong. 
@ PaulsWalls2 @ adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 Daniel 9:27 is about Jesus, not the antichrist 
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Do the math. I don't know how you get the exact number 70. 
@HectorCannabis @lisasharper "Nice Cherry Pick"? Is that the name of your new strain? I quit smoking. Thanks for the offer though. 
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 TBH I trusted a teacher who presented this bad math too when I first became a Christian. When I realized the math didn't add up, it turned me against that teacher and made me distrust everything he ever said, and it turns out it was one of his lesser bits of misinformation. 
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If Daniel was making a wooden literalist point he would have said 490 years, but he didn't. Instead he put it in a strange way made up exclusively in terms of highly symbolic numbers. I suggest doing a word study of 70 and 7 
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If you want to understand how this symbolism is interpreted in ancient Hebrew culture, then I suggest looking at a non-canonical work called the Book of Jubilee. It clearly shows that people of that time would see the weeks in terms of eras marked by creation and rest. 
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 No. I think prophecy is primarily symbolic and points to a spiritual reality more than a wooden literal reality. In prophetic terms 70 is not 69+1 or 71-1. It's 70. 70 weeks of years is not 70 * 7 = 490. It's symbolic multiplied by symbolic. 
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Yes, 445 was to rebuild the walls. The walls rebuilt with the help of strangers as the prophecy said would happen.

@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 See here's the thing: numbers in ancient cultures, especially in Hebrew culture, are not seen as modern western man sees numbers, in which the number 7 is simply one more than 6 and one less than 8. They have symbolic power. 
@ adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 That's not what Ezra 1 says 
@lisasharper With all due respect, the song was not an improvised song. It was the AIM (American Indian Movement) Chant. There's no conceivable scenario where beating that particular song in the face of anyone could be confused as a sign of peace. It's 100% provocative.

@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I am not gonna argue with that :) 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You must also understand that the prophetic idiom is not the same way we talk with our friends in 2019. It's a specific genre with a specific way of going beyond the mere physical, not to exaggerate like a fisherman describing a big fish, but to show the spiritual importance

@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Here's the gist: God doesn't generally give prophecies that are an insanely long period in the future without saying something like "seal up this prophecy" or something similar to make it clear that it is a long time away. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Yes, read Nehemiah. The King of Susa helps build the walls. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 Again. 539 BC 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Ezekiel 34-37 is about restoration and peace; 38-39 is about a period of tribulation ushered by Antiochus Epiphanes 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 That's a messianic prophecy fulfilled in Christ. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Please, please, please do not say that Isaiah 60 is about airplanes. 
Yes! A stranger built the walls! 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Hosea has the same structure. The people were wicked and shall be punished but God will show mercy on them. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Isaiah 60 is about the restoration of Israel. Again 539 BC. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Isaiah 49 is about the restoration of Israel. Again 539 BC 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The bible doesn't give that specific information. You're making a historical argument. I'm telling you what we know about from historical records. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The ones that remained were intermarried with the pagans. The ones who left returned with the rest. Who do you think Jesus' neighbors were? 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 From a quick scan these all already happened. What's your issue? 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I asked for one. Please give me one. Now don't point me to something written during the Babylonian exile that prophecies the return in 539 and say it is not fulfilled. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Have you read Ezra? It's about the return. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It was written during the Neronic persecutions in the 60s 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I'm trying to be open minded, but I am not sure where you are coming from. Could you please name one of the supposedly hundreds of unfulfilled prophecies? 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Most of Jesus' disciples were from the 10 northern tribes. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ PaulsWalls2 @ NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 They did. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 John wrote that in the 60s. The temple was still standing then. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 That's a dishonorable use of the text. The text was about what was happening then. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I'm talking about the nation. It was gone. Certainly not every individual of the nation was killed. The early church in Jerusalem fled to the mountains just like Jesus warned them to do when they saw the armies surround the city. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Are you asking if every single individual returned, then no. Did they return? Yes. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I don't know what you mean about the application. This is a prophecy that played out in history. God punished the northern kingdom who were captured and dragged off. Same with the southern kingdom. 
@higham_mark @ejioforkel @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Yep. Jeremiah is all about offering negative sanctions of exile with one hand and future hope of restoration with the other hand. Ezekiel too. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It was annihilated. Did you know some big event happened in 70 AD? 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Jeremiah is talking about the return to the land in 539 BC. To make it about anything else is to not honor the text. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Israel return? What are you talking about? Matthew 24 is about the annihilation of Israel. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Did you notice that when discussing the Fig Tree Christ says: "Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place." That generation already passed away. Those things took place. If you don't see that maybe you are misinterpreting it. 
@ejioforkel @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Simple. Jeremiah wrote about the return of the people from Babylonian exile and that occurred in 539 BC. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @adrianturner01 @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 My point is you're now sounding like a preterist. 
@Swtladee @Lex_Lutheran "Native Twitter has gone ablaze as a Native American elder singing the  AIM Song in Washington DC during the Indigenous Peoples March was  ridiculed, taunted and mocked by a group of non-Native youth." https://t.co/bfLjNBP0WN 
@Swtladee @Lex_Lutheran LOL it's actually a pretty cool chant that is pretty popular. Indian Country Today also confirmed that it's the AIM chant. 
@Lex_Lutheran @Swtladee I got an MA in colonial history with a focus on Native studies, but we learned about more contemporary issues, and I hate to say it but a lot of the 70s era activism was 100% aimed at taking real issues and provoking potentially violent confrontations for media coverage... 
@higham_mark @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 God question! And was the Apocrypha "given by inspiration of God" when it was being translated for the KJV? 
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Listen, I thought you wanted a non-RCC translation, but the KJV translators kept a lot of the Vulgate's mistakes because they were popular misconceptions. Not my problem. 
@MonasticMystic @Lex_Lutheran @Swtladee The first reports I heard made it out like they were a roving pack of street tuffs looking to start stuff, but then I saw a video of what looks like kids at the bus stop waiting for their school bus to pick them up to leave the March for Life event. 
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Are you that attached to the Latin Vulgate? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Although it cleaned up some of the more obvious issues, e.g., the Jeremiah vs. Epistle of the Hebrews covenant vs testament distinction, the translators did not go far enough. I'm guessing it would have ruffled of the feathers of some of the Anglican liturgical ceremonies. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The KJV translation team was apparently more interested in maintaining the continuity of this bad translation than have coherent continuity within scripture. It was a bad call. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Another example, when the Vulgate translated Jeremiah 31 it uses the word pactum for the covenant, but when the Jeremiah passage is quoted in the 8th chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews it uses the testamenti or more specifically "testamentum novum" 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 ... When translating the Greek, the translators preferred testamenti even when referring to things in the OT it previously translated as pactum. For instance, circumcision was a sign of the testamenti in the NT and pactum in the OT. It thus created a false discontinuity. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The KJV error likely stems from an over reliance on the Vulgate, who were the first to introduce this covenant (pactum)/testament (testamenti) distinction in translating the Hebrew and Greek... 
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The "the end" was the end of the old covenant order: symbolic atonement, sacrificial system, temple worship, pilgrimages to Jerusalem, the old covenant, the waiting for the messiah, etc., etc.. Daniel is writing about the end of all that. 
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Was the sacrificial system ended? What else are you waiting for? 
@ adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 Check your math 
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Did the messiah form a new covenant with many? Was the messiah seemingly left with nothing after being cut off? Did the messiah atone for sins? Was Jerusalem destroyed? 
@adrianturner01 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Are you still waiting for the messiah to be cut off and the temple to be destroyed?

@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The whole week way of describing it makes the "pause" theory not credible. When do you believe the pause started? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 That's a problem if you want to understand scripture. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 There is no consistency. The KJV was made up of translation teams. Some apparently preferred one word over the other, but the end result of their team effort is a product of confusion. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 To be completely honest, I don't know how this is even up for debate unless you mistake "the end" for the end of the universe, which is a big, big, big interpretive mistake. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 During the Babylonian exile, we had specific prophecy about the return and when it would occur. Not so with 1948. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If I didn't understand how covenants work I might confused by it, but then we'd have to change the meaning of everlasting. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 There is no gap. The temple was destroyed. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If it is a testament, it changes nothing other than to confuse people by introducing a weird translation. What is a testament? A covenant. What is a feature of a covenant? Continuity. What does a testament provide? Continuity of inheritance to an elected people. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So God promised them to multiply and enter the land of Canaan. Then there's this part about possessing it, which historically did not happen. I understand why that didn't happen. It relates to understanding the nature of covenant. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 By all means, advance your case, but I suggest not working backwards from a 1611 English translation to the Greek where you might get tripped up by a word that is similar in the English translation, but not related in the Greek. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I am the one talking about Daniel. I don't think Mark said anything about it. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 All these texts work together. Christ is the one who brought the new covenant. He established the Lord's Supper as a sign of the covenant that Daniel said would be cut just prior to being cut off himself. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Christ refers to this explicitly in Matthew 24. He claimed to be that Messiah, who would cut a new covenant with the many and be cut off to seemingly have nothing and then the temple would be destroyed. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Now compare this Mat 26:28 to Daniel 9 about the Messiah cutting a new covenant with many for the forgiveness of sin prior to being cut off and the temple being destroyed. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 "And he gave him the covenant (diathēkēn) of circumcision" (Acts 7:8) 
 
"for this is my blood of the covenant (diathēkēs), which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." (Matthew 26:28) 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If that's not what you're saying, then why bring up Revelation 19? It's a different word. Perhaps I am missing your point. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Could you do me a favor and tell where the unconditional covenant with Jacob is mentioned? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You've been saying that the word for a person's account means the same thing as the word for covenant when you feel like that's how you want to interpret it. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 When Christ refers to the Lord's supper he uses the word diathéké for covenant. It is the same word for what was delivered to Abraham and Moses 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Josh showed me that a testimony is not the same as a covenant but nobody thought they were since the NT writers used two different words for each 
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @higham_mark @JeffPassage @ PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 Future? 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So we live in the new testament, not the new covenant even though they are exactly the same word? Very clever :) 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Rev 19 is not referring to covenant (diathéké). It refers to a testimony (martyrian). It is where we get the word martyr 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Why didn't the writers of the NT distinguish? Paul was known for inventing a new word when the occasion called for it. Why not here? 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So there is no new covenant if the KJV only translates the word for covenant as testament? 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The IF is all the believing ones 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Same word. It is not the best translation but it is fine as long as you speak of an Abrahamic testament and a Mosaic testament and a Davidic testament etc 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It is not an either or. A will is a covenant. Look to Daniel who said the messiah would cut a new covenant with many and be cut off. Testament is a double word play because it had to do with Christ's death but it is still a covenant 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It is the same word in the Greek :) 
@higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Yep. This is devastating blow for the position that holds the New Covenant is some futuristic exclusively Jewish thing after the dispensatioalists get beamed out

@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Why? The author to the Hebrews said all that was passing away. And why did Paul preach the kingdom in Acts 28? I keep asking you this but you never answer. 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It is kind of odd. Jesus preached the temple would be destroyed 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 In other words the truth changes for different ethnic groups? 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So 2+2=4 depending on the ethnicity of the person you are talking to? 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Acts goes up about 62 or 63 I believe. Paul was beheaded a few years later. That is not a big window 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You said Peter, John, and James led the churches in Asia astray, right? 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Both were written around the same time, 60s 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So Peter and James and John are in hell for spreading a false gospel? 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You call us cold because we hold to election, but your narrow warped definition of the gospel is held by so few people that you end up sending more people to hell then the most cage stage Calvinist 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You are being evasive. You have made it clear that virtually all churches do not have the "true" gospel so they aren't saved. Heaven must be roomy 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Since people have not arrived any where close to you until very recently and there might be a thousand people who agree with you then most Christians since the beginning have not believed what you consider to be the true gospel. They are in hell, correct? 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Your definition of the gospel has been held by less then a thousand people 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Nobody thought anything remotely close to dispensationalism until very recently and if dispensationalism is the gospel then 99.9999% of Christians are in hell 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Darby is too moderate for you guys 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Of course you think every RCC, Lutheran, Calvinist, eastern orthodox, methodist, baptist, etc, etc , etc, all had a false gospel and were damned 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Even during the reign of Constantine at the church at Jerusalem?

@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Seriously, no Christian thought anywhere remotely close to you until less than a century ago. Is that when heaven opened up the gate for the first time since the first century? 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Well you do not think anyone in the early church did. You do not anyone in the Roman church did, nor eastern church, nor reformation. So when did people start going to heaven? 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You act like everyone went to hell until mid Acts dispensationalism came around. Not true 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 God will judge his heart. If it turns out that he never converted then he did great things for the church by legalizing our faith. It was an answer to many prayers

@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 We also know he professed Christ and was baptized and you question his faith. I do not know where you get that right 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You assume he didn't but you have no evidence. All we have to look at is his works which are a million times greater than yours

@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You're deflecting again. I can't picture you walking across the street to build a church. Those people traveled across nations out of love and you want to judge them like you're more spiritual then them. You don't know anything about them. 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Look at the passion they had for Christ compared to you who won't even get into a vehicle and drive to church. 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You're deflecting again. So unbelieving gentiles knocked down unbelieving gentile temples to build churches for other unbelieving gentiles? In what world does that make sense? 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Now who was in control of Jerusalem? 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 333: The Eleona Basilica is built on the Mount of Olives, marking the site of the Ascension of Jesus. 
335: First Church of the Holy Sepulchre built on Calvary. 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 326: Constantine's mother Helena visits Jerusalem and orders the destruction of Hadrian's temple to Venus which had been built on Calvary. Accompanied by Macarius of Jerusalem, the excavation reportedly discovers the True Cross, the Holy Tunic and the Holy Nails. 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 c. 325: The ban on Jews entering the city remains in force, but they are allowed to enter once a year to pray at the Western Wall on Tisha B'Av. 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 A significant wave of Christian immigration to the city begins. This is the date on which the city is generally taken to have been renamed Jerusalem. 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 324–25: Emperor Constantine wins the Civil Wars of the Tetrarchy (306–324) and reunites the empire. Within a few months, the First Council of Nicaea (first worldwide Christian council) confirms status of Aelia Capitolina as a patriarchate... 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Who controlled it then? 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Let me help you out while you go off into a totally different tangent: the Crusades were about RETAKING Jerusalem. They had it. They lost it. It was under their control. 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Rome let the Muslims take it because they had a beef with the Byzantines. 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 What do you think the Crusades were about? 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It was Christian land. They planted churches. They went on pilgrimages to it. It was theirs. 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You can't even seem to resolve the issue without creating more issues. I'm not going to let you forget this. You have solved nothing. In fact, it is a very clear illustration about how bankrupt your system is when it is forced to take in all the words instead of skip over them. 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 There are earthly repercussions for sin. Now don't change the subject. The Church controlled that land for quite some time. That's why there are super old churches there. 
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If you're not part of God's people, then you're damned. 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Or why Paul spoke about the Kingdom to gentiles. Or why Paul taught baptism to gentiles. Or why the Church is called terms normally applied to Israel. Or why the Church brought YAHWEH's name to the world and not Israel. 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You haven't explained why church discipline hearings (two or three witness) is the same exact formula as Israel's legal proceedings. Or why Paul told Christian children to obey the fifth commandment. Or why the Church had the same responsibility to care for widows as Israel 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 But you have a false sense of clarity based on ignoring continuity. We've illustrated this time and time again. Just from the other day, you still haven't explained why Paul taught former pagans to partake in the Lord's Supper when it is supposed to be for the Jewish Jetsons. 
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @ PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 Who here is a gentile? 
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @ PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 What promises? 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The Church already did take over that land. Idolatry became widespread and God sent the Muslims to punish them. Sound familiar? Yeah, that's what God did to Israel with Babylon. That's what God does to the Church. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Hmm perhaps. My knee jerk reaction is to worry that it blurs the creator-creature distinction, but I suppose there could be a case for that view under a headship approach. What benefit/implications does it have? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Are you asking about the traditional Talmudic interpretation of the Godhead? 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It matters a great deal to your boy Knox. It's the basis of everything he's saying. 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I'm not denying what you're accusing me of denying. God elects His people. He was one people. 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The administration can change forms. The manner of fulfillment can change forms, but there's one people of God. Israel was a continuation of a continuation of a continuation. Some people get cut off along the way. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Okay, so why interpret every reference to the Godhead as being a reference to the Father alone? 
@ PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 I'm talking about Christ. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I am led to guess that's what you believe because your boy Knox apparently just sees any reference to God and assumes that it is about the Father. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I'm sorry, but your system has you going into grotesque places. I'm not talking about the bride metaphor. I'm talking about what you do to the Trinity. Do you guys even believe the second person of the Trinity existed prior to the incarnation? 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Christ is true Israel. In order to understand this point you need to stop thinking like a modern westerner trying to do a crude mathematical equation. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Paraphrase: "You can't have Israel married to the father and the church married to Christ and have the church be Israel because you can't have one bride married to a father and His son, that's gross!" 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Not at all. What I hear when you say Israel and the Church is not an apparently obvious statement. I hear the implications that you draw from it. You are putting the Trinity into Civil War. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Why is it so unbelievable that someone can understand the argument and not agree with it? The man believes in weird living on different planet stuff. It is not even close to credible. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Christ says that scripture is about him, not Israel. Your dechristening of scripture is incredibly concerning. 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So the point of scripture is not really about Christ, it's about Israel? Got it.

@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It is a simple question. Do you own it? 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So you do not disagree with the assessment? 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It was not a compliment 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 This is why people say you have an Israelcentric method 
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Thank you! Someone needed to ask it! 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 But won't they be discouraged when they realize he makes stuff up with a straight face? 
RT @bkben3: https://t.co/80FGqQhzpz 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 He's going for strawmen in the title alone before he even says a word. Then he immediately goes into rapture fever. Please, why? Why? Why? 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 He thinks that people who do not hold to a Israelphile view of scripture believe that the church is the physical seed of Abraham? Why is he saying these things? Who takes him seriously? 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I'm not being contrarian. I sincerely with all my heart believe that you are completely wrong on this subject. Your video has a strong start if the goal is to make stuff up. Please find another teacher. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I don't get why a supposed Christian has the same hermeneutic as a Jewish Nationalist who can't understand the difference between bloodline and covenant 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So when you think about the Lord's Supper your mind goes straight to Israel? This is why you are accused of being Israelcentric rather the Christocentric 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Do you feel yourself unworthy of the promise because of your bloodline? Well let me share the gospel with you! You too can partake in the covenant of promise regardless of your bloodline! The message of the Jewish messiah is going out to the whole world! All to the glory of God! 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Before the great commission, non-Jews were "strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world" and now you know about YAHWEH but you wish to remain a stranger to the covenant of promise. Does that seem odd? 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If you guys are going to make some big distinction between the same Greek word (diathéké) whether it should be translated as testament or covenant, then you guys should figure out which applies to this "dispensation" and which is just for the Jewish Jettsons. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Paul: "our sufficiency is from God, who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit." 2 Cor. 3 
@ PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 You're on the outside 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The lamb that takes away sin. What's that about? 
@ PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 Was Noah a Jew? A son of Abraham? 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Then go back to Daniel. The Messiah would form a New Covenant with many and be cut off. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You sacrifice an animal for a covenant. You spill its blood and you eat its flesh. Where have I heard that before? Oh yeah, the Lord's Supper 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 What do you think a covenant involved? The death of an animal. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 It's the same word in Greek! 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Surely, you feel the weight of this issue on your entire system. I suggest giving it some serious thought and prayer. 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Why? Is this the New Covenant? 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So did Christ return and that justifies not practicing the Lord's Supper? Did Paul forget that it was just supposed to be a Jewish thing like you said? Paul apparently isn't as good at "rightly dividing" as you are! 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Nope, but there's 100% continuity between what Christ said to the 12 and what Paul told the former pagans in Corinth. 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You said that gentiles should not be participating in the Lord's Supper because they are not part of the New Covenant, because the NC is only for Jews. Why is Paul spreading it to the gentiles? 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 We are told perform the sign of the New Covenant in the form of the Lord's Supper from the time of the Last Supper until he returns. 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 If gentiles were doing things they should not have been doing Paul would have freaked out and said something like I wish they drank themselves to death. 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So Paul was telling Jewish women to act modest like Jews but he forgot to make that known in his letter that it was just for the Jewish women? Your method makes not sense. 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You said the New Covenant is for Jews only and the Lord's Supper is a sign of the New Covenant and Paul taught the former pagans to observe it. How does that make sense? 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 So Paul was a Judaizer because you think some Jews were in Corinth? 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 LOL where was Paul to call Paul out for being a hypocrite like Paul did to Peter. You're not making sense. 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 According to you Paul would be judiazing the former pagans by telling them to observe the Lord's Supper. 
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 The New Covenant is the post-resurrection administration of God's covenant that was announced first to the Jews and then to the gentiles 
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 That's what Christ told the 12. That's what Christ told Paul to tell the church. You can't process this information because your dispy slogan won't let it compute. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Paul taught them to observe it! Paul taught them it is a sign of the New Covenant! He said we should celebrate it for the same reasons Jesus told the 12 to celebrate it. Address this issue. 
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 And you still haven't explained why Paul was teaching the former pagans to observe the Lord's Supper. 
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Yes, yes, I know they were all Jewish, but Christ said the supper should be practiced as a sign of the New Covenant until he returns, not after. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 You guys need to have meeting and figure out what is going on with the Lord's Supper (a sign of the New Covenant) is being practiced in a dispensation that it shouldn't be practiced in, and why Paul was practicing it in Corinth among former pagans. It's all very strange. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Do you celebrate the Lord's Supper? 
@JeffPassage @ PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 Do not go full Nicolas Cage https://t.co/1nGYXFa2iq 
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I'm sorry, but I'm not going to let this go. You have to deal with it. 
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 What are you talking about? If Jesus told the 12 to do it, and Paul told the non-Hebrews to do it, and it is a sign of the New Covenant, then what on earth are you talking about the New Covenant being a futuristic, Jewish only thing? 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 And none of that got through to you? It's just bouncing off you like nothing. Paul said to put on the full armor of God, not the full armor of dispensationalism. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Thanks for supporting my point :) 
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This  cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it,  in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink  the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. 
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 This makes it crystal clear the continuity between Jesus' message to the 12 and Paul's message to the church and that the New Covenant is now. You have to be invested into a serious error not to see it. 
@higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 I have no idea what his point is. 
@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 That's not what I'm saying. I have never said anything that could lead you to insinuate that. Our mission has not changed: bring the gospel to the whole world. 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 There's no such thing as a suspended covenant. That's is analogous to a divorce. A divorced couple are not in a covenant union. Romans 11 speaks of a prophetic restoration. 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 Yes, and then they will enter the New Covenant community, which is the only thing that matters. 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @ PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ PTerrone1986 @ pbcmike98 There is no Israel 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 "Believing Israel" means nothing. Are you covenantally alive or are you covenantally dead? That's the question. Christ brought the New Covenant. If you don't get on board, you're covenantally dead. 
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @PTerrone1986 @pbcmike98 To the people of God. The covenant people. The sons of Israel were grafted into that body of believers. Gentiles were grafted in as well. 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 Well that's good for the congregation. I've heard that tension is a common though. Those were anecdotes, but I've heard enough of them to make a mental note. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 Very true. It is both a string and percussion. I think more people on the street would think of it in terms of beat vs melody though. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 I had heard the gospel hundreds of times before then. I thought it was absurd and the people offering it were absurd. It repulsed me. At the time of my conversion I hadn't been witnessed to in years. 
@bkben3 I thought this was a generally accepted fact. Amill wasn't even a term until about 1915. Prior to that all amills were considered postmills. I think it has 100% to do with the Zeitgeist of post-WWI era pessimism. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 I personally don't see it as a big deal or something to be legalistic about. It's more about sincerely trying to honor God and worship in a way that would not be a New Covenant version of "strange fire" innovations. 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 We are catholic. The universal church. Not the individualistic anarchist reflection of a decadent American culture church. 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 My pastor lives on church grounds. It is pretty humble. You guys seem to associate organized churches with these charlatans that seem to have taken over the "evangelical" world. 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 First off, that's rubbish. Secondly, Jesus' references to two or three witnesses is from the Torah. Paul said the exact same thing. They set up the church as true Israel. This big sharp cut in the fabric of time isn't as clear cut as you seem to think. 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 I'm a traditional Presbyterian who subscribes to the regulative principle of worship. I don't believe in that stuff. I think they are dangerous. 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 You are an antinomian anarchist playing cosplay Christian. Christ set up the church. Told it to the apostles. They set up the churches after Pentecost. Paul says the exact same things in the pastoral letters. You are on the outside.

@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 It's called a statement of faith or a "What We Believe" document. Since we were just talking about Indiana, I'll quickly find one in the Dispensationalist network. Oh here's one: Liberty Bible Church. Does it have a confession? Yes. https://t.co/2LRhlNt15q

They have something for everyone there, but you can't find a church for you? Have you wondered the problem might be with your theology?

I think his theology is so idiosyncratic and dogmatic that he won't go any place. 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 You obviously don't have an appreciation of Church history. Augustine was writing during a transitional period in which he had aspects of catholicity as well as incipient Romanist concepts. Augustine needed reformation. 
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 The Romanist aspect should be called on to be reformed just as the eastern orthodox should be called on to be reformed, but the universal catholic church is nothing to be ashamed of. 
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 We have a connection to the ancient universal (catholic) church along with its ecumenical doctrinal creeds. We are not afraid of history, nor do we deny history. 
@NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @PTerrone1986 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 This dude goes on and on about this being "the church age," but he seems to be saying that he's not a real member of a real church under the authority of a real minister of a real church. He's his own fake Pope of his own fake church.

@JeffPassage @higham_mark @Valerie__Writes @PaulsWalls2 From our conversations you've made it abundantly clear that you heard the preaching of the gospel and you made the wise decision to have faith and because of this wise decision you merit salvation and the guy without faith doesn't merit salvation. Don't play with words. 
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @Valerie__Writes @PaulsWalls2 Because we hold to the biblical view of monergism, in which regeneration procedes directly into saving faith, we are the only ones who can claim faith as a non-meritorious act of God's grace alone. What you have to do is play games with the definition of merit. 
@PaulsWalls2 @Valerie__Writes @ReeFormedFaith @NahumOBrien Okay be evasive. You want the king to pardon you but you do not acknowledge him as king. That is just having knowledge. It is not being known though 
@PaulsWalls2 @Valerie__Writes @ReeFormedFaith @NahumOBrien Being in the body is being in the Covenant, which you reject. That means you know about the body. That's all. 
@PaulsWalls2 @Valerie__Writes @ReeFormedFaith @NahumOBrien Christ shed blood for his sheep and you deny being one of those sheep. That makes you unknown 
@PaulsWalls2 @Valerie__Writes @ReeFormedFaith @NahumOBrien I think anyone who rebels against entering into Covenant with the Triune God will not reap any benefits. In fact, you have enough knowledge that you heap up judgement by merely giving intellectual assent 
@Valerie__Writes @ReeFormedFaith @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien They claim to be outside of the Covenant. They think the signs of the Covenant aren't for them, but there is no salvation outside the Covenant. What they have is knowledge. Knowledge outside of Covenant just means more judgement. 
@Valerie__Writes @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 I like it when they interpret “God is no respecter of persons” at face value instead of looking up what the phrase "respecter of persons" actually means: Someone who treats people according to their social rank, status or importance.

@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I can read whatever I want. Nobody cares. We aren't treated like little kids like IFBs treat their congregants. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I don't know how they can complain. The entire queer Christian movement is essentially consistent dispensationalism. The law of God doesn't matter anymore. Everyone is under grace. You just need faith. Why are dispys fruit checking because they go to gay bars? 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 The antinomian ones are the worst. They preach antinomianism and cheap grace all day long until one guy in their congregation brings his boyfriend and then they turn into HUGE Lordshippers talking about obedience to God's law. Funny how that happens. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I'm saying IFBs gross me out. I feel sorry for the people who are spiritually abused by these charlatans, who tell people not to read any books and to listen only to them. It's very cult-like. 
@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I'm sorry but IFBs gross me out. It's like an involuntary reflex. 
@higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I saw that and cringed. Yuck! Paul, if you're just going to steal his argument, why not just scan it and put it here. 
@higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 After telling Ezekiel that virtually nobody is going to listen to him, God commands him to "speak to them and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God,’ whether they hear or refuse to hear.” As such, Ezekiel is leveling blessings and curses. Jesus said shake the dust off your feet. 
@higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 This is essential teaching. Hard hearts do not hear. God says "the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me: because all the house of Israel have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart." The heart needs transformation first. 
@higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Paul is dipping into Ezekiel 3: "Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears." Isn't that an odd way of phrasing the process? It's almost like something happens in the heart first before real hearing can take place. 
Wow, I just saw the film "First Reformed" (with Prime), and it is one of the most interesting films I've seen in a while. It is an illustration of how self-destructive people become when they try to fill what they perceive as God's silence with politics. https://t.co/WLmD2P08vy 
@ PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @ pbcmike98 @ PTerrone1986 Yes. Yes. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I've already moved on. Unless anyone has any serious questions for me, I think all that can be said has already been said. 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You seem to conflate reading "another man's opinion" with being forced to accept it. It's okay to read books that challenge your thinking. You don't have to be afraid. They aren't going to kill you. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 The issue is not that you cite scripture verses. It's that you manhandle them to the point where they can't be harmonized with other parts of scripture, which is why you have to come up with the Jewish George Jetson technique which doesn't even solve all your problems. 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It's not that you don't need to read them. It's that you don't want to read them. It's because you're from a culture that is hostile/afraid of reading other people. 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You give too much credit to White. He didn't invent the "flattening out" phrase. It is actually a common phrase found in theology books, but you take pride in not reading theologians so you wouldn't know it. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It is because I consider your school of theology to be heretical. Why wouldn't I reject it? 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Compromised is a word that captures all those other words you listed plus more. My "obsession" is taking the whole council of God to avoid misrepresenting Him as a cartoon. 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You are squishing everything down into a flattened out question of gettin' to heaven so when I say God disciplines people in this life you think I'm talking about something I am not talking about. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Not even close. Go take a look at atheist twitter. 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Simply getting the results of what they've done in the flesh is not going under the blessings heading. God disciplines people. He disciplines nations. He gives compromised Christians over to their enemies just as He gave compromised Israel over to their enemies. 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 My evidence? Talking to you guys, talking to other fundies, hearing their sermons, seeing surveys of fundy attitudes towards learning, knowing the history. 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You are avoiding the real thesis: if you make perseverance in faith an unnecessary work, then faith is optional five minutes after getting faith. 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Fundies embrace a culture of anti-intellectualism which stems from their wider fear that the world is crumbling around them. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Result of the fall of the 1st Adam: 
 
"I will put enmity between you and the woman, 
and between your offspring and her offspring;" 
 
Messianic prophecy of future hope in the last Adam: 
 
"he shall bruise your head, 
and you shall bruise his heel.” 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Christians get the curses and blessings. Look at the once faithful churches who God divorced. Look at the material blessings taken away from those who turn away. Look at the enemies getting the upper hand. God is still in control. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Boasting of the power of God offends people at the fleshly level. They nitpick it. They change the subject. They disrupt the flow of scripture all in an effort to get out from under that fact. Then they blast those who proclaim it. It's not surprising in the least. 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 If you consider persevering to be a work, then you are saying that you also consider faith five minutes after accepting an alter call to be completely optional. 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Which is why all I get is "#SMH" from your camp when I bring up apostasy or even someone who appeared to everyone as OSAS who later became a Satanist. You simply shutdown and act like it is impossible or hypothetical. 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Like I said: fundies do not like complexity. There is no born again new birth certificate you can frame and put on your wall. There is no official acceptance paperwork from God with your name on it with the "genuine" box checked rather than the "self deceived" box checked. 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Jude is bringing attention to the fact that God does not send down a born again certificate. Some people hear a five star preacher man and get all frenzied and are bored of Christ a week later. Or throw in the towel under adversity. Fundies do not like complexity 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It is understandable to people who have the whole council of God 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I understand it. I just find it goofy and unacceptable 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I do not accept the idea that Jude wrote his letter to the Jewish George Jetson 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I reject your interpretation. It's too outlandish and idiosyncratic and novel. It is also completely unnecessary. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PauleyMo67 @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It's a historical narrative.

@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PauleyMo67 @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I understand that dispensationalists tend to take a DNA approach Genesis 6. I really, really, really don't want to go down that rabbit hole. Either way you look at it, it's still about covenant. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PauleyMo67 @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 There is no literal/physical seed of Satan. Some Rabbis had weird theories about that, but they are wrong. It's about who is your master: God or the serpent with the freewill gospel? 
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Speaking of Jude. Did you notice how he prayed to God who has the power to keep the people from stumbling? It's almost like stumbling is under the sovereign decree of God too! Such an odd absence of modernist humanist thinking in Jude. 
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It is the same with fallen man. He needs to be regenerated to see the sweetness in the offer. Otherwise, it is just as repulsive to him as it is to his fallen angel counterpart. 
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You are not addressing the actual point. We are fallen now. You say we are affected by it, but not really. I doubt you'd say that a demon could hear a five star sermon and say "wow I have been super wrong, let me say a prayer and get faith." Not gonna happen. It repulses them. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PauleyMo67 @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 This is about covenant, not DNA.

@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It was a Messianic prophecy. The entire OT is filled with foreshadow and typology of that prophecy. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Cain was never going to master sin. He had no inclination to master sin. Do you realize we are talking about a reprobate? 
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Do you understand that something can be a foreshadow and be a real event at the same time? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It is a foreshadow! How can you not see that?

Cain had options. His hands crafted what his heart desired, which was dedicated to his father the serpent. 
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Did Cain actually master it? No. And the reason why is he was a son of the serpent. Mastering sin was not in his nature. Thus, there was inherent antithesis between him and Abel, which is why he murdered him. 
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 John writes: "We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one." Can you think of anyone else called the evil one? I'm sure you can. Well, Cain was his son, not literally, although some Rabbis entertained that idea. 
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 What bible am I reading? The same bible that presents Cain as the quintessential son of the serpent.

@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 What people choose is a reflection of their nature. They are not neutral in any regard. 
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 So you love your sins less then say Stephen Hawking? You chose God because you are better then him? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 And if that is what you are saying then explain the difference between those who react positively vs negatively 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It sounds like you are saying that man's consciousness is not affected by sin and all he needs to hear is a five star sermon to rationally accept what Christians accept

@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Ezekiel prophecies about the construction of Temple II and you don't see it. Daniel prophecies about the destruction of Temple II and you don't see it. Jesus prophecies the destruction of Temple II and you don't see it. You are waiting for some big event that already happened.

@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Here's one of my critiques of dispensationalism: I never hear you guys ever talk about the role of the the second temple in prophecy either it's construction or destruction. Everything about the second temple is pushed into some futuristic era as temple 3. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Thank you for the challenge, but like I said before, I don't have the technology to Skype. I have a Nook and a desktop. Also I'm not sure if it is my thing. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Read the work in its entirety. Notice the genre. Notice the literary devices. Notice the symbolism. Notice the representations. Notice the analogies. It's about the destruction of Temple I, exile, making of Temple II 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 That prophecy either already happened in a manner in which you haven't considered or it never will happen. 
@higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I'm under the impression that that dispensationalist theology has essentially been an answer to Pharisaical objections to Jesus as the messiah. They essentially take their misconceptions and incorrect expectations and shove them into the future rather than correct them.

@BWSchank @bajaturbo @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 So blasphemy is just an issue of hurt feelings? 
@BWSchank @bajaturbo @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Well somebody has got to rule. If you want to surrender that responsibility to God's enemies, then don't pretend it's a prophetic sign of the end times when it's judgement as a consequence of Christian escapism. 
@ PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @bajaturbo @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @ pbcmike98 @ PTerrone1986 https://t.co/E84UsPP9KA 
@BWSchank @bajaturbo @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Scripture defines the difference between a dead martyr and dead blasphemer. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Dispensationalists say that Satan is the king of kings and the rulers are subservient to him. Paul says that rulers are subservient to Christ, the King of kings, even if they do not acknowledge it. 
@bajaturbo @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 A civic government not governed by Christians wouldn't care about blasphemy laws, which is why our society is becoming increasingly more and more blasphemous. Geneva, however, was governed by Christians. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Then what Paul says about civic leaders makes no sense. It is yet another example of how dispensationalsim confuses people. 
@bajaturbo @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 While the church-state distinction shouldn't be interpreted as the secularists insist, there is a biblical distinction in administrative purposes. The Inquisition as an arm of the "church" had no right to administer that sort of justice. Their power extended to excommunication. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I've been asked more questions then I can keep track of by this point. You'll have to be more specific. 
@JeffPassage @ PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @ pbcmike98 @ PTerrone1986 What logical fallacies? 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 But Paul does not say anything about mercy and grace. He speaks of being a terror to the wrongdoers, which Paul most certainly meant in a biblical sense. Now that does not exclude mercy nor does it make mercy the main objective. It takes wisdom to know the difference. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I agree that Paul did not distinguish between saved or lost rulers, because Christ is King of kings and Lord of lords. His Kingdom extends beyond heaven and the hearts of believers. 
@ PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @ pbcmike98 @ PTerrone1986 God's law 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 That's what I'm saying. If you have some illegitimate court that violates biblical codes of legal conduct, then that is just a refined form of murder. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I believe it was Paul who wrote that their job was to be a terror to the lawless. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 If that's a sin then the person who picked that mode of execution is responsible. Civic leaders are not in the primary business of dispensing mercy and grace. They dispense law and justice. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You're frustrated because logic insists that there is a real distinction between a civic court dispensing judgement based on the rule of law and some guy shooting a store clerk. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 So when a murderer gets lawfully convicted of being a murderer and is executed is the guy who administers the lethal injection a hit man? 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Wallaaah there's a fact behind your ear! 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Here's the thing: we know the Jewish mob did not have the right to carry out the death penalty. It had to go to Romans. Where was the Roman judge? 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Was it a legal proceeding? Did the executioners have a fair trial? Did they present witnesses? Did they even have the right to carry out the execution according to the law? 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You see the difference don't you? 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Who put the anti-blasphemy laws on the books? The church or the state? Who carried out the court proceedings? The church or the state? Who determined guilt? Church or State? Who picked the method of execution? Church or state? 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 If I am the star witness in a murder trial and my testimony sentences a man to death am I a murderer? 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Arminius was a Calvinist until he wasn't. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Is "responsible for many deaths" the same as murder? 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Would a witness for the prosecution in a capital crime case be guilty of murder? 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 You don't need to be Arminian to be an open theist. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 If they saw that as some legalistic commandment, then Jesus corrected them. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I know there's a lot of disinformation out there from dishonest people, who are terrified of their congregants embracing these ideas, so they spread lies. 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Bingo? Who asked the question? 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 I'm not too familiar with the Lutheran position(s). It is my understanding that although Luther made predestination a point of contention with the Papists, his later followers widely downplayed this aspect of Luther's theology. 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 They sold everything in the city (which Jesus said would be destroyed in that generation) and moved outside the city and pooled their money among themselves. They did not give it to random poor people. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 There are Calvinistic Methodists, Calvinistic charismatics, Calvinistic IFBs, Calvinistic Southern Baptists, Calvinistic dispensationalists, etc., etc.. Embracing the five points is not enough to be in the Reformed camp. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 First off, let me clear something up. The five points are not Calvinism. They are the five points of anti-Arminianism. Secondly, being Calvinistic is not being Reformed. The five points only make up a sliver of Reformed theology. 
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 A large crowd on a mount 
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It's basic reading comprehension, not dispensationalism. If giving up all possessions was a universal commandment applied to everyone and not simply his entourage of disciples during his earthly ministry, then Jesus would have said it to every person he met.

The Lord has made everything for its purpose, 
even the wicked for the day of trouble. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It's not about turning away. It's about not honoring God as God or giving thanks to Him. This is a major problem in dispensationalist circles. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 It doesn't appeal to some people's hearts, because in their hearts they are in love with their own will and they want their will to be done on earth and in heaven. Dispensationalism is an embodiment of this type of heart. 
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Christ: "And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward." 
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @higham_mark @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 So you just went out into the public sphere and made your prayer for everyone to look at you and a few moments later you write this slander. You just can't help yourself. 
 
Woe to you, O Jerusalem! 
First off, WOE is a bad thing to hear from prophet. It means you're going to get it. Secondly, it doesn't say "clean yourself up"

@higham_mark @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 The problem is God said that the secret decrees belong to Him and we should concern ourselves only with following His commandments, not trying to contrast the commands with the secret decrees. It is a recipe for disaster. 
@JeffPassage @SolaScriptura99 @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @pbcmike98 @PTerrone1986 Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil.

@presbycast @bkben3 I bet, especially among people knee deep in blasphemy, but there might be a psychological aspect that mitigates against it. I know of ministers who are nuts on Twitter, but their garbed sermons are 100% blandness. 
@bkben3 @presbycast I'd really be interested to see any evidence of a minister (regardless of denomination or theology) really cutting up or trying way too hard to be relatable/"cool" or making silly pop culture references while wearing special religious garbs during a service. 
@bkben3 @presbycast I suspect putting on the garments of an office holder has gravity. I doubt a King putting on his crown feels like he's just putting on his "normal work clothes." I've heard from police officers that putting on their uniform has symbolic weight. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @PresbyPolemics The work of the law is written on the hearts of humanity as a whole. Even the sociopath knows what he's doing is wrong. In fact, the knowledge of the sinfulness of his deeds is the source of his pleasure.

@PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I said the world is bigger than a little plot of land the size of NJ. It is not every single person and plant and animal and germ and virus etc 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I'll take any real questions if you've got them 
@higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Exactly! Why pray if God isn't in control? Why pray for the conversion of others if God can't overcome their autonomous free will? 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies We are told to pray. We are given the desire to pray. We are told to make requests from a position of humility. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Intense communion 
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies God has a purpose for everything. We do not need to understand what the purpose is, but we do not ever question how He decides to run the universe to work out His will. Such questioning is a lack of real faith. You seem to have an issue in that arena. 
@First_Cabbage @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @BWSchank @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies @PresbyPolemics If find the challenge helpful for myself and for people who are on the fence about to go down the wrong path. If you are annoyed at the number of notifications I will double check to remove your name from the reply chain 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies See there you go again being the Braveheart to the wicked. This is why I find your whole system completely liberal and humanist. They thought they could just go raping their way through Asia and God would sit back and do nothing? 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Our society is being judged for hating God. Meanwhile, many Christians think playing Braveheart for the reprobates is like the most loving thing ever. Others reject their responsibilities to be light via escapism into unbiblical rapture mania. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I'm a compatablist with regards to Satan. Scripture is crystal clear about it.

@JeffPassage @jasonschomburg @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies So you take credit for something the divine power does? You don't see a problem with that? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @jasonschomburg @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies The Lord's Prayer and 1 Cor 10:13 are not in opposition. 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Who has ever said this? You're playing make believe 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies That's completely unsubstantiated 
@JeffPassage @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies This fits under the umbrella of He hardens who He wills. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I deny nothing. I love the whole council of God. Dispys can't say the same. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Not personal vengeance. Civic leaders have a responsibility and authority that non office holders do not have. If they hate blasphemy against God as poison for society, they can do something about it legally 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies God isn't big on blasphemy. He is quite clear that neither shall we. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Not a member of that club, but apparently you haven't dropped the whole Spartacus for the reprobate gimmick. I wonder what God thinks about that. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I get it. I get it. You're super pro-blasphemy. 
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies I'm giving you a challenge. You can test your OSAS idea while you're at it. (BTW I don't know how you manage to reconcile those two views, but okay) 
@JeffPassage @higham_mark @BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @preacherthoward @Coach_Elrod @faithfulfamlies Prove it. If your pride means that much to you, then renounce Christ and become a Satanist just so you can brag that you have the free will to do it. Meanwhile, everyone else will say they went out from us because they were never of us.

Converts get the sacrament after belief. Children of believers get it after birth. Hence the household baptisms. Hence the overwhelming historical evidence. Nobody had a problem for like 1600 years.

Compatabilism is thoroughly biblical, which is why all Jewish sects ascribed to it, except the Sadducee (they rejected scripture as God breathed), and why the apostles spoke about predestination, prophecy, etc. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @Pjg19792017 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @mikem2u @j_kordusky @lampandlightmin @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage First, Josephus was not a stoic or platonist. He knew about them because he was educated in a wide array of subjects, just like Paul, and scholars have made the same claim about him btw. 
 
More importantly, where was your position during the times of Jesus?

They were completely heretical, not hypocrites like the Pharisee. They justified their free will arguments on the claim that God is weak and far away. This is how it tends to go.

They took credit for what they did rather then give credit to God. Jesus called them hypocrites

Nevertheless, there has always been a godly remnant, and just as not all Israel is Israel, not all the church is the church.

Freewillism entails autonomy, not being contingent or limited by anything. The best example of it is the transsexual movement, in which people define themselves against their own nature.

@ThomasCoutouzis I've been fascinated by this letter. The other day I had an odd thought: is it in the realm of possibility that Jude's remark about wanting to write a more comprehensive letter (verse 3) refers to a work he would later complete; i.e., the Epistle to the Hebrews?

For instance, there were twelve apostles under Jesus. The number twelve was literal/descriptive, but it is also symbolic in that it evokes a host of other images, e.g., the twelve tribes. 
@mikem2u @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @JeffPassage @j_kordusky @lampandlightmin @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Yes. They have real meaning with power. Think of Jeremiah when he became a prophet. He heard a voice that was not "literally" there. Then he was told to announce what he saw. An almond branch. A pot. They were not "literal", physical things. We don't know what they were. 
@jabuc @XyZyddious @JenHatmaker I'm actually pretty ecumenical in my understanding of who I consider a "real Christians." There are a lot of sects and denominations in Christianity. I disagree with some, but they're still Christians. The liberal attempt at Christianity is another religion though.

@XyZyddious @jabuc @JenHatmaker It's more like finding out what the "cool" heathens are talking about in regards to crushing Christianity. Read that memo.

@nocoradio You'd make a good editor if you're not one already. The condition of "only" was pretty heavy-handed on my part. I am not sure if even the most antinomian dispensationalist hyper grace teacher could be accused of only talking about forensic justification. 
@ExilePolitics @AngelaBocage @traveller_terry But still... that fits comfortably under the umbrella of the self-congratulatory, fashionable, (post) modernist ethos, but I get your quibble.

I'm open to suggestions. 
@AngelaBocage @traveller_terry @ExilePolitics In a sense I agree with you. The liberal expression of Christianity is an entirely different religion with an entirely different concept of God. It's just not the God of special revelation.

@nocoradio I get where he went off the rail, but honestly who is allowed to say something like "maybe we've become imbalanced in talking only about forensic justification to the neglect of the whole package which includes sanctification" and not be called a neolegalist with another gospel?

@BWSchank @mikem2u @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @j_kordusky @lampandlightmin @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage And Paul says the Church shouldn't walk in the ways or be conformed to the image of Christ where? 
@BWSchank @mikem2u @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @j_kordusky @lampandlightmin @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage And Luke says that where? 
@BWSchank @mikem2u @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @j_kordusky @lampandlightmin @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Why would Luke tell Theophilus about these things? Maybe Luke doesn't "rightly divide" like you. As an author filled with the Spirit to write scripture he apparently also dropped the ball in not telling Theophilus how to "rightly divide" the Book of Acts. Weird, right? 
@ExilePolitics I wonder why Christians think that some people are only interested in their faith to make it about liberal politics. If only they got hip to the cultural appropriation call-out culture, then things would get interesting :) 
@bee_cw What do you do as a rebellious French boy going to schools with domineering Stalinist headmasters who only cared about Marxist categories? Rebel by become a nihilistic hedonist under the banner of post-structuralism 
@RegReformedGuys @BarleyAndBeans Fortunately, Rome is completely incompetent and is moving towards more and more worldly, "relevant" modernism post-VatII. Oh and they keep molesting boys. 
@RegReformedGuys @BarleyAndBeans The same lack of seriousness in sermons that contributed to the YRR phenomenon a while back could have a liturgical counterpart: people going to Rome for the smells and bells led by men not trying to look down-to-earth in a leather jacket. 
@RegReformedGuys @BarleyAndBeans It's something we need to keep in mind. I keep an eye on the Roman apologists and the most effective go after our weak spots; e.g., there's a lot of vapidness and frankly silliness going on in Prot churches: a 20 min adult contemporary rock show followed by a stand up routine. 
@RegReformedGuys @BarleyAndBeans LOL same here 
@RegReformedGuys @BarleyAndBeans Ice cold! https://t.co/334y96ilt6 
@BarleyAndBeans @RegReformedGuys Don't get me wrong: Rome sucks. They had their lamp stand taken a long time ago, but their problems stem from serious theological errors too many to list here. 
@BarleyAndBeans @RegReformedGuys LOL or maybe I'm just projecting. I recall the first time I experienced a real, self-consciously liturgical liturgy there was a split second of inarticulate discomfort as if something Roman was about to go down, but a second later I realized liturgy is beautiful thing. 
@BarleyAndBeans @RegReformedGuys Although Baptists suffer the hardest with Romaphobia by far, it is a widespread Prot condition stemming from our history as defining ourselves not by who we are, but too much by our nay-saying and battle scars to the point where accusations of Roman-ness are seen as a check mate.

@First_Cabbage John seemed to view instruments as similar to divorce, an accommodation https://t.co/FBc07R0cfz 
John Chrysostom said something similar 
@PauleyMo67 None of the non-Lutheran reformers endorsed instruments apparently 
@First_Cabbage It isn't like blood signs (circumcision and animal sacrifice) fulfilled in the cross or the temple which Jesus cursed as destined to destruction. I don't get the argument yet 
@gosuperaa @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 @First_Cabbage Reformed is in relation to Rome. The real theology is called covenant theology 
@gosuperaa @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 @First_Cabbage Then take dispensationalist out of your vocabulary

@gosuperaa @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 @First_Cabbage Do you really think that reformed people deny that Jesus was predestined? 
@gosuperaa @First_Cabbage @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 It is not a problem for the non strawman reformed position 
@gosuperaa @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 @First_Cabbage Jesus came into the world for the world. This is amazing for some and heaped coals for others. Preaching the gospel to to the unelect is a form of judgement 
@gosuperaa @First_Cabbage @JeffPassage @AddieMiller0330 You do what you are. The elect will sin because they are not fully sanctified in this life 
@DrMcCleod @emzanotti A skilled carpenter living in the area where he was working on a building project in Galilee as Joseph was wouldn't want to give up land rights in Judea. The ruling elite were trying to dispossess the ancestral tribal system of land ownership via legal trickery

@1689Wolverine And none of the Latin American countries could execute prisoners without DC approval. Pay high taxes to DC. Have protest movements crushed by DC. Have DC soldiers in every city. Utopia!

I have been guilty of importing my own modern assumptions and trying to say the text says something that it does not. The Spirit convicted me of that though.

There are people who do that with socialism (a modern concept) as well as autonomous freewill (a modern concept)

If you can't get enough SJW in today's church, check out the USA TV series called "Damnation" for some retro church social justice. It's about a socialist pretending to be a preacher in rural America in the 1930s.

Let me translate for you: don't follow the heretics, follow me. 
 
What it does NOT say: don't follow Jesus, Peter, John, James, or Jude, follow me because this is the cult of Paul, nobody gets to the Father except through me.

@BWSchank @PauleyMo67 @JeffPassage @Brother_Douglas @ThaRealJgibbs @childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @illyahkuryahkin @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Dude Marcion is your patron saint. Get out of town

@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @childofpromise3 @higham_mark @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Marcion's heresy was crushed. The early church excommunicated him. He has nothing to do with Calvin. You're getting jumbled. 
@BWSchank @PaulsWalls2 @childofpromise3 @higham_mark @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien I'd be shocked if you thanked God for anything.

@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @childofpromise3 @higham_mark @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien For real? Do you thank God for your daily bread when deep down inside you think you should take credit for it? Did God work a 9 to 5 for the money to buy it? Did God go to the grocery store to buy it? Did He make it for you? You did it all. Giving false glory is fake piety. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @childofpromise3 @higham_mark @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Your closest ideological brethren in history is Marcion, but that was rightfully crushed.

@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @childofpromise3 @higham_mark @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Great verse. Not sure if it helps your cause for glorifying yourself 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @childofpromise3 @higham_mark @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Dispensationalism is pretty recent, like a hundred or so years ago. Mid Acts Dispensationalism was invented like decades ago. It's super fringe. It's all man made. Not to mention, in case I wasn't clear, it's all very, very wrong. 
@BWSchank @childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Hairs on your head bro. Hairs on your head 
@BWSchank @childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Please, you're going to have to convince me better than that if you want me to believe your revisionist fantasy that you're calling history. 
@BWSchank @childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Just to clarify, it was invented by men, very, very insane men, who were rebuked by other insane men (your dispensationalist brothers), who think your system is insane. 
@BWSchank @childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien LOL it was invented like, what, 50 years ago? 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @childofpromise3 @higham_mark @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Nice try. We all know you think Peter sucks. 
@childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien That's a good place to start. It is important to keep in mind that your trust is based on the assumption that He is in control of it all. Your praise of Him is based on the premise that He reached out and saved you. He gets the glory, all the glory. 
@BWSchank @childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien You act like Mid-Acts Dispensationalism dropped from the sky 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien LOL we are talking about apostates. Apostates have no blessings.

@childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien The parable of the sower is an excellent example. When you combine that teaching with other teachings, you'll realize that God has dominion over the environment (shade, water, etc.) and protects His people. 
@BWSchank @childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Your weird, idiosyncratic perspective has already been made clear. She was talking about Calvinism. Try to keep up. 
@childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Generally speaking, I suppose that's right, but there is an element in RT of God invisibly prearranging the whole thing even though we might have the impression that we are the ones taking the lead. 
@childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien Reformed theology makes a distinction between the general calling and the special calling. The general calling is hearing some street preacher, but having the message roll off you. The special calling is the effectual call where everything comes together and you respond. 
@childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien In reformed thought, the church is visible and invisible. Generally speaking, we are confined to dealing with the visible church, which contains a mix of elect and unelect people, and we don't know who is who. The falling away passages are directed to the visible church. 
@childofpromise3 @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @illyahkuryahkin @PauleyMo67 @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @mikem2u @NahumOBrien That is a real problem for those who are mere 5 pointers (as distinguished from reformed). Contrary to popular opinion, the real point of reformed thought isn't free will or predestination. It's covenant, which fully explains the falling away passages.

I asked for a verse. I can show you explicit NT commands to baptize, but where is your evidence? 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @childofpromise3 @BWSchank @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @ThaRealJgibbs @mikem2u @NahumOBrien "Do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father,’ for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham." (Matt 3) 
@PaulsWalls2 @mikem2u @BWSchank @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage This wouldn't be the first time such remaking had occurred. Ernest Renan (1823-1892) did the same with Jesus. He claimed Jesus purged himself of all Jewish traits and become an gentile ("Aryan"). Dispys say Renan got the wrong guy. To put it lightly, it's all super weird. 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @childofpromise3 @BWSchank @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @ThaRealJgibbs @mikem2u @NahumOBrien You dispys need to make up your mind whether the Kingdom of God is physical or spiritual.

@mikem2u @BWSchank @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @PaulsWalls2 @jasonhatch20 @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Are you sure Paul wrote those things to gentiles?

@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @ThaRealJgibbs @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Yes Paul was Jewish and that requires work so he went around building churches. We just need faith or so I am told 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @ThaRealJgibbs @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage You just listed a bunch of shalls and shall nots. I can do what I want in the age of grace, or so I am told

@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @ThaRealJgibbs @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Because if we talk about how faith shouldn't be a coping mechanism to not feel guilt about living like a heathen then we would start sounding like Jesus' brother James, and that's not for the church, or so I'm told. 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @ThaRealJgibbs @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Maybe all that stuff in Paul about doing good and not sinning wasn't for the church? Maybe there are different dispensations within Paul's letters that we need to "rightly divide", i.e., not think about. Maybe all we should focus on is the parts we like? 
@PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @jasonhatch20 @ThaRealJgibbs @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage I saw that, but what's this do good work stuff?

It is a theology, not a religion. Christianity is defined as a religion and you define yourself as outside of religion. Therefore, you should stop associating yourself with Christianity. 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @teach_tao @JeffPassage @jasonhatch20 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @higham_mark @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage That makes Ephesians 5 completely meaningless. "Now as the church (F)  submits to Christ (M), so also wives (F) should submit in everything to  their husbands (M). Husbands (M), love your wives (F), as Christ (M)  loved the church (F) and gave himself up for HER"

Also according to BW, when Jesus said that he was laying down his life for his sheep it couldn't be for you, because sheep = Jews. We have to rely on the new religion Paul created, which is completely distinct from Jesus. This sound cool? 
@PaulsWalls2 @JeffPassage @teach_tao @jasonhatch20 @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @higham_mark @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage "As we now know it"

Paul isn't operating under your methodology at all. If he were, then he wouldn't talk of sheep, but he does. He wouldn't quote Jesus' prophecy that you say is for Jew to non-Jews, but he does. Now you're all jumbled up. 
@JeffPassage @teach_tao @jasonhatch20 @NahumOBrien @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @higham_mark @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage St Paul: "I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock." Flock = sheep. Paul was back to quoting Jesus, who said "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves."

@NahumOBrien @BWSchank @higham_mark @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Wow it almost seems like it is a philosophy that has to destroy scripture to prop itself up 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage First to the Jews then slam on the breaks and readjust your mind for something totally distinct... and then to the gentiles 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Yeah Christianity is greater than intellectual ascent yet you freak out over having to get off the sofa and do anything 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Paul did not redefine the phrase. You just do not understand it 
@BWSchank @teach_tao @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage What was Paul teaching? The thoughts of Plato? 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage He gave us the world! 
@BWSchank @teach_tao @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage That is the Great Commission! 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Read Acts 28: For two whole years Paul stayed there [ROME] in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.  He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ—with all boldness and without hindrance! 
@BWSchank @teach_tao @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Go out and convert the nations is the Great Commission. That's what Paul did until the day they cut off his head. 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage You interpret the kingdom like the Jewish zealots. Please give this some more thought. 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage I already showed you that Saint Peter taught the same thing. You just ignore it though. 
@NahumOBrien @BWSchank @higham_mark @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage People of all walks loved the Temple. There were some forced conversions to Judaism. The Pharisees also did mission work. The Idumeans were basically practicing Judaism. King Herod was not the only practicing Jew of Arab descent. It was a popular religion. 
@BWSchank @teach_tao @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Paul was doing the Great Commission! 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Also, I will again point out something you continue to ignore. Paul preached the Kingdom to everyone. 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Are you forgetting about the post-resurrection ministry where Jesus explained all the stuff they missed and what they continued to miss was further illuminated by the HS? 
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Who did the other apostles hear it from? An evil spirit pretending to be Jesus? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage It would boggle the mind if they didn't and that's why the early church baptized infants. Plus, they understood typology and symbolism a million times more than modern man. Modern man sees symbols as inferior or meaningless, but that's our problem to grapple with. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Do you have any idea how big the average family of that time was? They were having a kid about every two or three years. Every household had a baby in it. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage I gave you the evidence of the household baptisms, which is the basis for the practice as is seen in the earliest church records. There is zero historical evidence that credo baptism was practiced on the children of believers at any point in the first 1500 years of Christianity 
@PaulsWalls2 @ThaRealJgibbs @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Agreed, but the head of the household can be held accountable for being a delinquent spiritual head. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Baptism isn't salvation. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage If you're not talking about Baptism or the Lord's Supper what are you calling the "sacramental system"? 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Yep, circumcision doesn't save either. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Unfortunately I am not in a good place to get my massive edition of Institutes and give it a good looking over, but if I wanted to understand what Calvin thought about Baptism I would go to his section about Baptism, not the Lord's Supper. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Yes. Disciples were not just kicking in households and baptizing everyone. The head of the house converts and says my whole house is going to be Christian now. Let's get baptized. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Maybe you're right and God performed a miracle by making sure that there were no babies in any of the innumerable households where everyone in the household was baptized on a single day ;) 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage What I just posted was from the Institutes. Infant Baptism is as old as Christianity itself so it has that going for it. Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper so your attempt to make it Roman is absurd. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage You have some bad info. Calvin did not believe in baptismal regeneration. He was quite clear about it: "that assurance of salvation does not depend on participation in the sacraments, as if justification existed in it." 
@teach_tao @ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage He went to his death screaming that Jesus was not Lord and Savior and anyone who thought that was idiotic. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage He reject the Trinity and called all Trinitarians blasphemers. He was corrected countless times. He was informed that they did not welcome heretics like him and they had laws against his type. He thought he was special. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage What's your opinion Josh? Where's your boy Michael Servetus now? 
@PaulsWalls2 @teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage You gonna cry a river over a heretic like Michael Servetus? Where do you think he is right now? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank I don't Skype. I don't even possess the tech to do it. I appreciate the offer though. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Or course he thought it was coming soon. He was in that generation, but it wasn't people getting beamed out into outer space and the sun dying and the stars from outside our solar system crashing into earth. It was the end of the order as they knew it. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage They sold everything in the city because the Messiah cut a New Covenant with many, got cut off, and God was going to destroy everything there. They weren't wishing upon a star. That's what happened. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage You don't think Peter ever read Daniel since Pentecost? The Messiah cuts a New Covenant with many. The rest get the Messiah cut off. Israel gets destroyed. Peter was there when Christ called the Kingdom a mustard seed, not a special effect event. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Why are you acting like this was some big question mark, as if events could have gone any other way? Every informed believer knew the city and temple was going to be destroyed. It was just a question of when in that generation it would occur. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Make up your mind: either they are a different species or they are not. I've made my position clear, but you're all over the place. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage I agree that they aren't a different species, but I'd like you to start reading the New Testament like you actually believe that. This whole mentality of Peter wrote to Jews so I can dismiss it because they are a different species than me is a broken, disturbing approach. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage And if Peter was teaching a message at odds with Paul's then Peter would not have mentioned Paul being another resource for what Peter was explaining. They are on the same page, but your system has blinded you. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Peter did not write a systematic theology. All the pieces are there but your system has blinded you to them because you want to treat Jews as some other species. It's weird at best. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage How does this happen? Peter: "knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot." 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Peter: "why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.” 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Peter stood up and said to them, "...we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus" 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @teach_tao @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Peter: "obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.

@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Make up your mind. Is baptism for the Jews or not? If the church shouldn't be doing it you should make a fuss 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage So you do not plan to inform them about your theory that they are basically Judaizers? 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage No duh. Baptism is a sign of the New Covenant. Yes, there is such a thing as the New Covenant and your church participates in the signs of the New Covenant, because God did not stop mysteriously get rid of covenantal signs. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Saint Paul: "I did baptize also the household of Stephanas."

@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage What would he have been expected to do? Stop robbing people? Oh the oppression! Oh the legalism! 
@NahumOBrien @BWSchank @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage A knife factory? 
@NahumOBrien @BWSchank @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Wow bullseye 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage I do not worry about it because I do not mock the covenant 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Paul had to tell them about the curse. To everyone else it would have looked like natural causes 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage I would not be surprised. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage The Lord's Supper was not a spiritual gift. It was a sign of the New Covenant 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Yes and instructed them  to take the supper with the utmost seriousness and never said it would go away after the temple was destroyed. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage If it was for a different gospel Paul would have shut it down quick, not teach them how to properly do it 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Jesus established the NC and Paul made sure the gentiles did it but that is neither here nor there to the dispys 
@NahumOBrien @BWSchank @mikem2u @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage One does wonder... hmm 
@BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Paul never said anything about a parenthesis. He spoke of fulfillment. He also spoke of covenant. 
@BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Seriously, where does scripture say the New Covenant was postponed? It does not even insinuate such a weird idea 
@BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Lol all the writers of the NT (which is really the same as the NC) wrote about the NC but it is completely pointless until thousands or millions of years into the future. Does that make sense to anyone? 
@BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Abraham had a revelation of future fulfillment. Paul had a revelation of fulfillment. We aren't talking about apples and oranges. 
@BWSchank @mikem2u @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage That's what you believe, but you are wrong. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @mikem2u @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Adam was typologically Israel. They let unbelieving women mess with their heads to the point where they rationalized sin, and they were kicked out of the land. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @thomas_broyles @mikem2u @JeffPassage @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Christ is the new Adam! He is the new Israel. We are Israel through Christ! 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @teach_tao @JeffPassage @mikem2u @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage His beauty was perfect 
@BWSchank @mikem2u @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage You define the Kingdom of God exactly like the Jewish zealots did. Let me assure you that the zealots had the wrong definition. It isn't Israel throwing out the Romans, killing the sellouts, and taking over the world with a sword. 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @teach_tao @JeffPassage @mikem2u @weecalvin1509 @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Absolutely not. Could a perfected being do anything other than be perfect? 
@BWSchank @mikem2u @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @teach_tao @higham_mark @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Paul taught the God's Law. Paul taught the Kingdom message. This is undeniable. See Acts 28. 
@teach_tao @BWSchank @mikem2u @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage We do. World means a lot of things. It depends on the context. 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @mikem2u @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Soon to Paul and the Romans 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @mikem2u @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage There is a huge difference between the world (non-believers) picking Satan as god and Satan being the actual god of the world (planet earth). God didn't crown Satan. 
 
@BWSchank @mikem2u @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage You think paradise is different from heaven? Did you ever consider that scripture is not an owner's manual for a printer? It is more like poetry intended to be evocative 
Uhhh... 
 
@BWSchank @teach_tao @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage That's not my call, but you are rolling the dice. If God didn't want you to take James seriously, then He wouldn't have preserved the letter. It would have been lost to history. He preserved it and expects you to be held accountable for its content. You've got no excuse. 
@teach_tao @BWSchank @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I didn't think you did dismiss it. Salt&amp;Light dismisses the book of James as not being for him. He thinks it's just for "the Jews". I know you two are on the same page against reformed theology, but you should know that he only believes that (parts of) Paul is relevant to him. 
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Man made? Man centered? How much do you know about the history of YOUR system? https://t.co/FnxAcHqWIW 
@ThaRealJgibbs @Billkjv73 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Good morning to you as well. 
I am not just engaging in wild speculation. It's the general assessment of scholars who have actually studied the works of the ancients from various cultures. 
He's not King! We elect Him! He can't tell us what to do! We have rights! 
 
@Billkjv73 @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Yep. Freewill in it's purest articulation is a modern phenomenon in the history of human ideas. The ancients didn't really think about it like us. Of those who anachronistically appear to think like moderns are two groups vilified in scripture: the Sadducee and Epicureans. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage The third person of the trinity was not a NT phenomenon. The HS is all over the OT. The HS inspired the writers and prophets. There were theophanies of the HS. The NT is more about the pouring out of the spirit on a massive scale 
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage All the OT rituals were types and shadows that pointed to Christ. It looked forward to that great day just as our rituals (Lord's Supper) look back. 
@JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @First_Cabbage Does a mighty God scare you? 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Lol you dispys have dismissed most of scripture and you wanna lecture 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Woah, "remove the Judaism from him"? It's just worshiping Yahweh, who did something big during Paul's lifetime and decided to use Paul to further the plan that was laid out from the beginning: bringing the world to Yahweh. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage LOL, no. It's called Tanna or Tannaim. It was the common Rabbinic system for passing on knowledge from a Rabbi to a student who would become an authoritative teacher. It's the basis for the Mishnah. Paul's teacher was Jesus, not a human teacher like one of the 12. 
@BWSchank @teach_tao @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Casting out demons? Healing? Speaking other known human languages? Prophesying? Visions? 
@BWSchank @teach_tao @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Uhh for starters there's scripture written after the road to Damascus. That's a divine intervention unless you don't believe that scripture is inspired. 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage It's context. Paul was breaking down all of history into a crash course for people who had no idea about Yahweh. The other writers assumed the readers had a lot more knowledge then Paul. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @higham_mark @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage WOW that's a stretch! What Paul is saying is that he didn't sit at the feet of Peter or James or John and memorize their sayings as was typical in the rabbinic system of teaching. 
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Types and shadows bro.

@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @teach_tao @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Salvation is Trinitarian and you're not in the Trinity. 
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage 1. Good news! I'm bringing home pizza!... 
 
30 minutes later... 
 
2. Good news! I'm here with the pizza! 
 
Chopping these two announcements up into opposing announcements with no connection whatsoever is asinine. 
 
Don't do that with scripture. 
@BWSchank @teach_tao @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage WOW. That's a bold statement. 
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @higham_mark @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Paul was attacking the Galatian heretics and you're setting him against Jesus and the twelve apostles. You don't need to do this. 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage If you think Jesus was in opposition to the 12 and the 12 were in opposition to Paul and Paul was in opposition to Jesus, then you don't understand any of them, nor do you understand the scriptures. 
@teach_tao @higham_mark @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage You don't say the Lord's Prayer? 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage "The gospel TO" 
@teach_tao @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Free will? yes. In the sense that they were not slaves to sin. Libertarian autonomous free will? Not really. 
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage https://t.co/fc8TGVAcAk 
@teach_tao @ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Serpent: "for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." 
@BWSchank @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage *cough* regeneration precedes a confession of faith. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Third person of the trinity 
@ThaRealJgibbs @higham_mark @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @First_Cabbage Satan pretends that he is free and he is furthering his plans, but scripture makes it crystal clear that Satan is insane for thing thinking that he is doing anything other than inadvertently furthering God's decree. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @weecalvin1509 @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage But very accurate. I'd throw in the word liberal too 
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage You don't think the Spirit prevents you from doing things you would have otherwise wanted to do? How does it make you feel that the Spirit is basically trampling on your autonomy? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Is that how you feel? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Yahweh took away His Spirit from Saul and sent an evil one so that Saul would mess up and David could get the thrown. Yahweh is the God of history. He does what He pleases. Faith involves trusting in His Wisdom in running all things. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage From the way anti-Reformed folk talk, what Yahweh did to Pharoah's heart was basically rape. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage But but but what about autonomous free will? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 
 
But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him. 
 
Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I form the light, and create darkness: 
I make peace, and create evil: 
I the Lord do all these things. 
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I form the light, and create darkness: 
I make peace, and create evil: 
I the Lord do all these things. 
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage God is just in control of finding a good parking spot on Black Friday, but that's about it, right? 
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Your Bible doesn't have God causing plagues or wars? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Ahh I touched your precious Human Autonomous Libertarian Free Will and you acted like I said something blasphemous. What do you really worship? 
@ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage You have more solidarity with the reprobate than the God of the Bible. You're just promoting liberal humanism. https://t.co/GH7g8Lnq4O

@JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Here's the thing. We don't believe him. You think it's the gospel. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage He promised that you can be autonomous like God 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage All you anti-Reformed people scoff at God's power and cry crocodile tears over the poor reprobate because it's not fair the God shows mercy on who He wills :( 
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Autonomous Free Will is there? The only person talking about that is the serpent. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @JeffPassage @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage "All thoughts actions and choices" are an expression of one's nature in a post-Fall world. When we die and our nature is perfected, we don't lose our AFW to sin and become mindless puppets. We will have no natural inclination to sin. AFW is an imported distraction.

Scripture talks of nature. Certain types of trees producing certain types of fruit. It does not talk about autonomous free will. 
@pastorErogers @aerich_a @CHSpurgeon ❤️ 
@pastorErogers @aerich_a @CHSpurgeon He just decrees things like finding a good parking spot. You're pro-witch? 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage You act as if He's no longer in control of history. 
@pastorErogers @aerich_a @CHSpurgeon Psst the Pilgrims were hardcore Calvinists :) 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage So you think the "age of grace" is characterized by God's abandonment? I couldn't disagree more. I don't expect you to change on it. You're deeply committed to Rapturology 
@JeffPassage @BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Yes. God is not on vacation running some other universe. Godless regimes doing godless things is a form of judgment, and instead of seeing it as such, you pretend God is on vacation. SMH 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I know your peculiar brand of eschatology. Don't want to go there, but you asked for an explanation that doesn't involve God going on vacation from running the universe. I gave one. God is in control. He's judging nations and churches. 
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Why would God allow King David to sin so publicly and make it completely clear that he wasn't the messiah? Hmm 
@BWSchank @JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Judgment. Germany was the first to go modernist. God took their light stand and they got their judgment. It was horrific. American Churches without light stands will get their own form of judgment. 
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Congrats. You've turned Christianity into just another philosophy. 
@JeffPassage @NahumOBrien @BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage 1. It is interesting. It's called regeneration. 
2. You need to pick one. Are we driven by our nature or by our free will? 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage You should boast more. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage You've got the power. Give yourself a pat on the back. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage That's self-election 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage So humans elect to be elect? 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage It's a sovereign decision. In the final analysis, when viewed in the fullness of God's power, people don't pick their parents. They don't pick to be in the body. 
@BWSchank @NahumOBrien @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I believe in corporate election. Some are called into the body via conversion. Others are brought into the body via faithful parents faithfully raising their children into it from childhood. Nobody outside the body (in a non-temporal sense) is elect. 
@pastorErogers @aerich_a @CHSpurgeon Desire? 
@pastorErogers @aerich_a @CHSpurgeon Cool. Apply that logic to everything else 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage I have no idea what you're talking about. We aren't using the same lingo in the same way. We aren't even on the same page of talking about a post Gen 3 world. 
@BWSchank @ThaRealJgibbs @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Regeneration excludes even the possibility of rejecting the gospel. That's the point. Unregenerate man hears a sermon and dismisses it. The same man could hear the same exact sermon after regeneration and be struck to his knees. 
@ThaRealJgibbs @BWSchank @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage Most people who convert have heard the same message many times before, but at some point it clicks. Regeneration is what makes the click possible. It happens before every real conversion. It's hard to describe because it is subconscious, but it happens. 
@BWSchank @Table_Talker @JeffPassage @ThaRealJgibbs @thomas_broyles @First_Cabbage The argument is that once the spirit regenerates the person always gravitates towards belief. Talk to a convert. They will likely tell you that they experienced something difficult to describe just prior to faith. It's the subconscious (regeneration) becoming conscious (faith) 
@pastorErogers @aerich_a @CHSpurgeon Is God a hypocrite for judging people who murder people by drowning them in the Red Sea when God drowned the Egyptians in the Red Sea? Please let that sink in: We are not equal with God. 
@pastorErogers @aerich_a @CHSpurgeon I already accused you having a non-theological understanding of evil. I just accused you have having a non-theological understanding of hypocrisy. I'm not going down the path with you into category errors that seem to run deep in your man-centered set of assumptions about God. 
@pastorErogers @aerich_a @CHSpurgeon You must be very confident that I am wrong because you are playing with fire. You also seem to be misusing the word hypocrite 
@pastorErogers @CHSpurgeon @aerich_a I find that hard to believe 
@pastorErogers @CHSpurgeon @aerich_a Judgement for sin. Do you just do topical preaching? 
@pastorErogers @aerich_a @CHSpurgeon The thief on the cross wasn't an accident of history. He was meant to be there. Like I said don't play around with secret decrees. It is not our business. Just follow the law of God. 
@pastorErogers @CHSpurgeon @aerich_a giving people over to lies and delusions is a form of divine judgement 
@aerich_a @pastorErogers @CHSpurgeon Prohibitions against stealing are found in the "Old Testament law." Since Jesus didn't steal, did he abolish the prohibition against theft for everyone? 
@pastorErogers @CHSpurgeon @aerich_a You're confusing this. I'm saying get out of God's business of how He decides to run the universe. It's not your concern. Soldiers don't need to be in the War Room with the generals. Just follow your orders. 
@pastorErogers @CHSpurgeon @aerich_a He doesn't? “The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things that are  revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all  the words of this law." 
 
God cannot be evil since evil is defined in terms of human rebellion, not in terms of preference. 
@TreyMays @SlowToWrite In case of a boring long commute, the audio version might come in handy. https://t.co/KQkrFZDTaA 
@pastorErogers @CHSpurgeon @aerich_a It's not an ole defense. It's a commandment. God specifically said mind your own business and don't be a busybody about how He runs the universe. 
 
Sin and evil exist only within the context of disobeying God. Recognize the hierarchy. 
@pastorErogers @CHSpurgeon @aerich_a “The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law." 
 
Don't worry about God's secret decrees. Follow the law. 
@BWSchank @BrazenSolomon @thirstynomoreAQ "God does not create people to go hell" is what you said. It sure sounded like a statement about His character. If that is not what you meant please accept my apologies 
@BWSchank @BrazenSolomon @thirstynomoreAQ The reason I "dwell" on that is that God's character is the same now as it was in 500 BC and you're making an argument about God's character. 
@BWSchank @BrazenSolomon @thirstynomoreAQ I don't have a problem with that. I'm not embarrassed of God. He shows mercy on who He wills. I'm not the lawyer for the reprobate. 
@BWSchank @BrazenSolomon @thirstynomoreAQ Could God have sent them prophets if He really wanted to save them all? Yes. Did He? No. Basically not a single person on that continent was in a covenantal relationship with Yahweh, and He did nothing to change that. 
@BWSchank @BrazenSolomon @thirstynomoreAQ The year is 500 BC. The place is South America. Where are the prophets of Yahweh? 
@BWSchank @BrazenSolomon @thirstynomoreAQ You act like this is somehow out of character for God. Prior to the Great Commission it was not even a point of discussion that the vast majority of humanity was destined for destruction and God was free to do that. Now Christians act like that is weird.

@TrinitarianRick @machenwarrior @EugenicPolemic @XpCoulson The church is essential. Unity is essential. Confessions are essential to unity in the church. It all points to Christ, the king of the church, who wants a united body, not individualistic anarchy 
@machenwarrior @TrinitarianRick @EugenicPolemic @XpCoulson It is a radically different view of the church. I get the feeling that baptists see the church as unnecessary as the confessions. The church is merely helpful

@machenwarrior @EvenWokerPresby @NFjords @presbycast I agree. Aside from one guy I am not aware of this being a major problem in the OPC (it seems to be more of a PCA thing), but it might be good to have some clarity on the issue if it could be handled correctly. 
@machenwarrior @EvenWokerPresby @NFjords @presbycast There is a lot of room to disagree. A postmill might accuse an amill of twisting scripture and vise versa. A young earth proponent might accuse a frame worker of twisting scripture and vise versa. We have to avoid setting up kangaroo courts over adiaphora 
@machenwarrior @EvenWokerPresby @NFjords @presbycast I would assume so. 
@machenwarrior @EvenWokerPresby @NFjords @presbycast In my opinion, Mika is playing with fire, but nothing concrete has been broken that would hold up in a hearing. 
@machenwarrior @EvenWokerPresby @NFjords @presbycast Twisting scripture in a way that went against the Westminster Standards   would be grounds for charges, especially in the setting of public worship. However, I believe pastors are allowed to file disagreements with the standards on a point or two. 
@machenwarrior @EvenWokerPresby @NFjords @presbycast Well the OPC started as a coalition of Presbyterians disaffected with the PCUSA. It included dispensationalists, evangelicals, confessionalists, etc.. I don't think Machen was super distraught about this at the time of the formation. 
@machenwarrior @EvenWokerPresby @NFjords @presbycast Machen had the correct view on prohibition. Biblical law does not forbid alcohol. Those in favor of prohibition were replacing the text with modernist theories. I would argue the same about gun control. However, this isn't heresy. It's symptomatic of something though. 
@jenjlen @stevenchoi @theboyonthebike Do you know what fake means? A fake seizure is not a seizure. Are we done here?

@bkben3 @RScottClark PCA is a coalition body with ambitions of having a seat at the big table. Going after FV doesn't risk that ambition. Going after the progressive cause would hinder that ambition. Engagement seems one way only 
@jenjlen @stevenchoi @theboyonthebike I invite you to look into it. They have people pretending to speak languages they don't know, pretending to have seizures, pretending to have uncontrollable muscle spasms, pretending to be drunk, pretending to be a microphone from God. It's all pretend. 
@jenjlen @stevenchoi @theboyonthebike If you are that concerned about people "using" epilepsy and Tourette's, then talk to the charismatics who are appropriating their symptoms in "worship". I'm asking them to cut it out.

@stevenchoi @theboyonthebike One does not "mature" into a position of affirming false prophets and false miracle workers and false forms of worship. It's not loving. It wasn't loving during the days of Moses when it was executable. It won't be loving when we're in the ground. It isn't now. 
@stevenchoi @theboyonthebike Forget the appearance of "haughtiness." I would give up speaking entirely if "vast swaths of global christians" promised to give up this ritualized blasphemy. 
@DougInRoc @theboyonthebike It is no question that at least some blasphemously fake it, and people who see it know they blasphemously fake it, but they tolerate the blasphemy because they want to be entertained. It is not worship. 
@ncchickers @theboyonthebike I'm not joking or making fun of you. They are meant to overstimulate. Please stay away from those services. 
@theboyonthebike Again: what happens when they get bored with inducing temporary madness with all the twitching and babbling and false miracles and false prophecies? What if they start to get embarrassed by Apostolic cosplay? 
@theboyonthebike @JOHNNYSWIM But what happens when pretending to be an epileptic with Tourette Syndrome stops being fun and starts to feel blasphemous? Go to the shaman healer? 
@rachelheldevans If you do not get it then you are in way too deep. "I do not understand how sacrificing to idols is a sin but being a white person who likes NASCAR is fine."

RT @douglaswils: Any appeal for societal justice that is not explicitly grounded in the law of God is activism in the cause of unholiness. 
@EvenWokerPresby @NFjords @presbycast It's symptomatic of something deeper, but in all fairness I strongly doubt this meets the standards for discipline. E.g., Machen was against prohibition, but I highly doubt he'd bring anyone up on charges for voicing an opinion in favor of prohibition.

@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 I'm sorry, but I work in advertising and it would be illegal to run an advert for unlimited atonement and have that many conditions applied to it. Why not just be honest about it? Jesus died to atone for the sins of His people. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 So when you read "And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins" do you see "His people" as the whole world? 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 So when you read: “For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for MANY [i.e., not ALL] for the remission of sins.” What do you think? 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Do you understand the objections to this? 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Yep. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 About a year ago 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 On the lower level, yes. Yes to all of the above. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 You are stuck on the lower level and the very discussion of the upper level clearly confuses you and you lash out. Hasn't that confusion been the root of this entire debate? 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 I could not disagree more. If that's your genuine perspective, then it is perfectly understandable why you have such a problem with reformed thought. Scripture gives us insight into the upper register. Reformed thought expounds on it. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 On the lower register, i.e., forensically speaking in our dimension where time is linear and our understanding is finite, yes. That's only part of the picture though. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Obviously by mentioning Pol Pot I wasn't quoting scripture. I'm making this real. If Christ died for Pol Pot that means he died in Pol Pot's place. That means Pol Pot actually receives Christ's righteousness. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Christ either took the proverbial bullet for Pol Pot and therefore Pol Pot has eternal life or Christ did not jump in front of the bullet to save Pol Pot. Substitutionary atonement requires a real substitution, not platitudes. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 God has love and wrath for Pol Pot. Jesus died for him but not really. Kinda confusing lol 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Wow if you read my tweets so poorly it is no wonder you have such an odd interpretation of scripture 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 God's redemptive love is the theme of the entire Bible. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 I thought that was an answer. He loved us while we were still sinners, because He had a redemptive plan set in place from the beginning. I'd have to do a word study of the use of the word "wrath" 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Simple. He doesn't have redemptive love for the reprobate. That's why limited atonement is the best logical and scriptural answer to your conundrum. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 I'd have to give that some more thought and study but my gut reaction is that there was never a millisecond where God did not know how things would unfold. I didn't surprise Him by submitting to His Lordship. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 That depends as well. Everything I did as an unbeliever culminated ultimately in my belief. Do I believe that it could have went any other way? No. Everything went according to God's plan. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 God is all those things for His people. As for the rebels, He damns them. You've got misplace sympathy https://t.co/os7Ya8khJ2 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 It depends on how much you want to consider it, but if I understand what you're getting at, I'd say the big moment was the cross. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 So how do you limit the unlimited, specific yet universal, everyone but not everyone, all but not all? 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 I am following it. That's your main point is that God is all love and mercy and Jesus paid the price for everyone's sins and Calvinists make God look mean by talking about His power and justice. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 If Jesus was the atonement for Pol Pot then that means God doesn't see his sins. He's singing with the choir right now 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Written during the reign of Nero 
@pastorErogers @Unpractical_Man @HacimMb I honestly don't know what you believe. All you do is jump on the internet and blast everyone for what you think they believe and reject correction by the people you are accusing. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 But I thought you were preaching that God was all love and peace signs and mercy to the max for every single person ever 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Jesus didn't die for Pol Pot to show lovey dovy sweet kisses and hugs. Pol Pot will get what he deserves, and if you think what he deserves is God showering mercy and love for all (including Pol Pot) then you have no grasp on Biblical eschatology. 
@HacimMb @pastorErogers @weecalvin1509 Exile would be a breath of fresh air compared to what I see. People don't care that they are getting false prophecies. Are they not entertained, though? Because that's what worship is now, entertainment.

@pastorErogers @Unpractical_Man @HacimMb Covenant is the means of communing with God. The Kingdom is a giant  covenantal worship service. I get the a sense that you are talking in way too individualistic terms. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 If we started handling these "prophets" like Moses said we should, how many would be jabbering? It would be the end of your movement. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 * God saves sinners 
@pastorErogers @Unpractical_Man @HacimMb I'll reiterate: if you want to understand reformed thought you need to  stop thinking in individualistic terms and start thinking in terms of covenant. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 And this is supposed to impress unbelievers how? 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 First off, didn't you just make a case that Romans 9 is about God hating a whole nation? Secondly, God loves His people. How is that not clear from scripture? 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Yes, they understood the real languages that they were really speaking. The one speaking Arabic it would sound like gibberish to me because I don't speak Arabic. To the Arabian it would have made sense because it was a REAL language, not babble. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 The grass accuses the rabbit of being unloving. The rabbit accuses the coyote of being unloving. The coyote accuses the farmer of being unloving. The farmer accuses the banker of being unloving. We all got grievances. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 People understood them on Pentecost. It was supernatural. There's nothing supernatural about idiocy. 
@pastorErogers @Unpractical_Man @HacimMb It is all covenant! That's the point of reformed theology. Are you in the covenant or are you out if it? Reprobates want nothing to do with it. God softens the heart of sinners and brings them into the covenant. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Unloving to whom? Unjust to whom? Vile to whom? 
 
Why do you even think in those terms? 
 
As a charismatic you probably habitually break the 3rd commandment, but don't you have any fear? 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 I am sorry, but I've never seen anything other that complete mindlessness. It's embarrassing. Unbelievers shouldn't be looking on people speaking in "tongues" and think you are out of your minds, but that is the case 100% of the time. Paul was trying to curb the practice. 
@pastorErogers @Unpractical_Man @HacimMb "For nothing"? What are you the Spartacus of reprobates? 
@Unpractical_Man @pastorErogers @HacimMb Eric doesn't seem to understand that he is the voice of the objector in this passage, and he doesn't get how offended Paul is by that line of reasoning. It's blasphemous reasoning. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @Unpractical_Man God damned the Egyptian firstborns for what their father did not do (i.e., daddy didn't kill a lamb and put the blood on his house). Look at the law, humans cannot punish the son for the sins of the father, but God has the authority to curse them for multiple generations 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @Unpractical_Man God can kill the Egyptian firstborns. Some random Hebrew slave did not have the authority to go house to house killing Egyptian firstborns. God can read hearts and minds and judge perfectly. Creatures cannot. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Oh really, what language are people talking? Who is translating it? Or maybe, just maybe, quite possibly, it's all mindless self-indulgence 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 Talking gibberish and making false prophecies does not glorify God. It's making worship about you and not Him. I find it repulsive. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @Unpractical_Man You continually imply that you don't get the hierarchy and the unbridgeable distinction between creator and creature. A lot of your inability to get what is being said stems from that. Is that from the charismatic tendency to sometimes see themselves a lil gods? 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb @weecalvin1509 The Apostle Paul after talking about how all the stuff charismatics love were coming to an end in the 1st century A.D., writes: "When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways." 
@HacimMb @weecalvin1509 @pastorErogers Will do 
@HacimMb @weecalvin1509 @pastorErogers What's his deal anyways? Is he a real life ideological Arminian? "Traditionalist" Southern Baptist? Independent Fundamentalist Baptist? A generic pick-n-choose liberal? Catholic? I have no clue. All I know is he hates Reformed theology with a passion 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb And if maple isn't allowed into the Kingdom, it wouldn't be unjust for God to prohibit both the sapling and tree from the Kingdom. If He wanted to show mercy, that's His prerogative, but we have zero evidence that He distinguishes between the little wicked and big wicked. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb Listen, I know this is tough stuff, but we're all mature here. We should  be beyond a diet of breast milk and baby food so let's talk like adults. I bet Pol Pot was a cutie pie too when he was a kid, but a maple sapling still grows into a maple tree. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb You mean the same type of cutie pies that our God told Joshua to slay? 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb The fall resulted in alienation from God, and the only way back is through entering into a covenant with YAHWEH, not a baby dedication to or a covenant ritual with Maat or Amun-Ra or Hathor 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb God took the lives of a bunch of pagan firstborns dedicated to demons, and as they grew up they became more and more like what they worshiped. They were 100% outside of the real covenant and so they received wrath, but you think they were some innocent typological of Christs? 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb So God deals out the most explicit form of Divine Judgement possible on people in order to send them to heaven? That sounds more like a religious sacrifice, not judgement. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb Scripture is clear on Esau. Answer my question. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb So God kills the cute little Egyptian cuddle muffins for having Egyptian rather than Jewish parents (in order to show mercy to His people) then what happens? You think God put the little pagans in heaven? What if He didn't show them mercy in the afterlife? Would that be okay? 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb Did the little cute Egyptian children have a choice in their parents? Nope. Nevertheless, they were still killed, and it was to show God's power and God's glory. Are you really okay with that? 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb I suspect you don't like to think about it, but that's our God, who we worship as totally loving to His people and praise as totally just. You need to grapple with what is your authority: scripture (including the stuff that gets raw) or your own determinations. Food for thought. 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb Are you sure about that? You are bringing up the same arguments that unbelievers bring up when they charge God with being unjust and unloving. How do you feel about the wiping out the Egyptian first born? Is that loving and just in your view? 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb Who are you? Who do you think you are? By what authority do you bring a charge? 
@HacimMb @pastorErogers Three forms of unity is alright with me :) 
@pastorErogers @HacimMb You seem to think doing bad stuff is the basis. A person paralyzed from the head down might not do anything but still be reprobate in his heart 
@Soapbox_Atheist Wow, there are a lot of atheists straying from the agreed upon script.  In case you forgot, the script is "We aren't suppressing the truth! We  don't hate God! How can we hate something that does not exist?" Not, "I  hate God so I'll pretend He doesn't exist." 
@PresbyPolemics @taylorderek I was raised by atheists so I have a conversion experience, but I know many people who were raised by Godly paedobaptists who never had a conversion experience. They simply grew and deepened in their faith and understanding 
@taylorderek @PresbyPolemics I understand that the experience of applying for citizenship, studying for citizenship, and finally receiving citizenship is probably pretty cool, but if your parents are already citizens and they raise you to be a citizen, I don't see the point of hoop jumping for an experience 
@taylorderek @PresbyPolemics They are denied the entry sacrament into the body while you're forcing them against their will to gather with the body when, let's face it, if you gave them a choice, they'd rather be playing video games

@TedGoodridge @blakelong94 @RyanLaw1998 @mwiersy @PatrickStirling @RevKevDeYoung If God really wanted to save everyone He could just sanctify everyone after death 
@TedGoodridge @blakelong94 @RyanLaw1998 @mwiersy @PatrickStirling @RevKevDeYoung If you say so but keep in mind your interpretation implies universalism 
@TedGoodridge @blakelong94 @RyanLaw1998 @mwiersy @PatrickStirling @RevKevDeYoung Scripture does not speak in those terms because it would imply a free will fetish 
@TedGoodridge @blakelong94 @RyanLaw1998 @mwiersy @PatrickStirling @RevKevDeYoung Peter is talking about the  70 AD judgement that Jesus spoke about on the mount of olives 
@TedGoodridge @blakelong94 @RyanLaw1998 @mwiersy @PatrickStirling @RevKevDeYoung You have an odd interpretation. Paul is kicking a dead horse and you keep fighting 
@TedGoodridge @blakelong94 @RyanLaw1998 @mwiersy @PatrickStirling @RevKevDeYoung So the Father didn't decide who would come to Jesus? 
@TedGoodridge @blakelong94 @RyanLaw1998 @mwiersy @PatrickStirling @RevKevDeYoung It's not hypothetical. He's saying God shows mercy who he shows mercy and addresses your specific complaint and tells people who make the complaint to check themselves. 
@TedGoodridge @blakelong94 @RyanLaw1998 @mwiersy @PatrickStirling @RevKevDeYoung Nobody is entitled to God's mercy. You are acting like it's a human right.

@TedGoodridge @blakelong94 @RyanLaw1998 @mwiersy @PatrickStirling @RevKevDeYoung Is it monstrous for God to create anteaters with desire to eat ants rather than chicken? Is God a monster for creating apple trees to grow apples rather than oranges? 
@TedGoodridge @blakelong94 @RyanLaw1998 @mwiersy @PatrickStirling @RevKevDeYoung Would it be monstrous for God to create vessels of wrath prepared for purpose of destruction, in order to make known the riches of his glory to those He decided to show mercy to?

@Splumner @LauraJanespoon @brchastain @C_Stroop I'll play along. So if we throw out the Bible and the imperatives that we derive from the Bible (which become our "preferences") we are left with what? Following Anoetos Greyfield as our guru? 
@AFreThought @InstaCalebM @C_Stroop Let's back up a second. Look at what has preceded this moment. Most of the people coming at me are not saying "hey, I'm a Christian!" They are saying Christianity is an oppressive fairy tale and people need to became liberated by apostatizing. 
@AFreThought @InstaCalebM @C_Stroop You have misread me. I said people who lack in faith tend to apostatize. If they apostatize, then they become apostates. If that doesn't describe you, then I'm not talking about you. 
@AFreThought @InstaCalebM @C_Stroop I agree that calling a person an apostate when they are not is wrong. Who have I wrongly accused? 
@Splumner @LauraJanespoon @brchastain @C_Stroop Those are some pretty harsh words. I'm in the OPC and the people in my fellowship would be appalled at breaking the first three commandments, and they'd want to know how that could be. 
@AFreThought @InstaCalebM @C_Stroop LOL a martyr of the mute button? 
@AFreThought @InstaCalebM @C_Stroop Calling someone an apostate is not like calling someone a "poo poo head." It's a spiritually clinical term that many of the people coming at me wholeheartedly embrace. It's not meant to be offensive, and I'm not bullying. I think apostates should apostatize instead of #PlayChurch 
@InstaCalebM @AFreThought @C_Stroop Mute me. That would be symbolically pregnant with meaning :) 
@allison_of_troy @xdoublestar @C_Stroop There's no problem. In order to avoid such misunderstandings in other encounters you should be aware that "touching a raw nerve" is a colloquialism that should not be taken formally or in a wooden literal sense. 
@Caitlin_Venable @dan_carmell @C_Stroop @LauraJanespoon @brchastain BTW I don't think it qualifies as a "break out." People just go from one subculture to another. Without God, there's nothing transcendent about it. Anthropologically speaking, most of you #EmptyThePews sound more or less the same.

@vintagejoehill @C_Stroop @LauraJanespoon @brchastain I didn't make any statement to Brave Heart. I shared my experience. He told me to shut up.

@C_Stroop @LauraJanespoon @brchastain Oh you mean helpful to your #EmptyThePews campaign? Yeah, that's not on the top of my agenda. You can have the apostates though. Take 'em all :) 
@C_Stroop I think I touched a raw nerve :( 
Now the Brave Heart of Apostasy is mad at me :(

@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton If you take scripture as the highest authority, there is a profound inconsistency. If you take yourself as the highest authority, then there is no contradiction. You can pick and choose what you like, but then that means you see yourself as a higher authority than God. 
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Do you understand the concept of defilement? 
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton If one has all sorts of invisible loopholes and the other does not, either the invisible loopholes are bogus or we are just bigots against bestiality for no real reason other than we personally think it is gross and we are more comfortable being inconsistent on that issue. 
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It was intended as a comparison. It was intended as a method of interpretation. 
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Okay, so you would say that according to the verse the feelings aren't explicitly condemned, but the action is? 
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Interesting, but I will ask again: If the phrase was "you shall not lie with an animal as with a woman," is this not necessarily about bestiality? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Okay, this is an incredibly specific command. 
 
Now let's see if maybe there are some exceptions to the rule elsewhere in scripture. 
 
 
Hmm let's look at other less clear verses and see if they support or complicate matters. 
 
Well, it's 100% consistent. 
 
"it" referring to the action just described 
 
 
"an abomination" meaning a special form of repulsive sin 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "I am the Lord." Means the speaker is declaring His Divinity and Authority. 
 
"You" meaning human males 
 
"shall not" an explicit negative command 
"lie" meaning sexual relations 
 
"with" meaning accompanying 
 
"a male" meaning human male 
"as with" meaning in the same manner as 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It's not up for debate. God said it. The case is closed. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton In other words, nothing will convince you and you'll find a way to wiggle out of everything by pointing to one source that simply expanded the definition to include certain heterosexual stuff and pretend that it changes everything. You've got an agenda. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Puberty is not sinful. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton A loving family is not sinful. "I am the Lord. You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination." 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton So you would be shocked if presented with evidence of execution of two male "lovers" in which no rape was alleged? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Not at all. I want them in the Kingdom of God, but that will not be their fate if they keep on the of sin. 
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton If the phrase was "you shall not lie with an animal as with a woman," is this not necessarily about bestiality? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "I am the Lord. You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination." This is clear. You have blinders on if you don't see that. How could it be any clearer? How? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I raised the issue of the myth of neutrality because you embrace it axiomatically. 
@absalomedia @omeagoz @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It was a rhetorical question that was making a parody of you saying it is somehow up for debate. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I should have brought it up before, but this picture is essentially  the position you've taken  with regards to LGBT stuff in the Bible.  "We've figured it out after thousands of years of years!" Which one is Matthew Vines? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton No. I am actively mocking you and your delusion of neutrality. 
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Okay. I'm going to assume you don't know the Biblical languages and give you a very respected translation from the Word of God: "I am the Lord. You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination." How do you interpret that? 
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Atheists aren't good at reading the Bible. Take a deep breath and try again. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It's the words on the page. It's the words in the Torah. It's the words in the Prophets. It's the words in the Writings. It's words in the NT. They aren't LGBTI affirming. In fact, they are explicitly hostile to advancing that pagan agenda. You're gonna have to do something more.

God is eternal. 
 
Nothing existed before Him. 
 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Oh well in that case let's just burn the Bible as a hate crime or go through and edit it all out because people who are rebelling against themselves are hurting themselves. 
 
Nope. They need God's word. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm talking about this "scholarship" that says "there's nothing against being gay in the Bible because words are confusing and it's a conspiracy against us!" 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton You buy into this myth of neutrality. Did you know I saw an article recently where scientists have proven to their own satisfaction that everyone who believes in a higher power suffers from a mental condition? Do you not see what's happening or are you gonna call a doctor? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton LOL it's 2018. Everyone with a flat screen thinks they're oppressed because their neighbor has a bigger one so now we're calling envy and covetousness a fight for justice. Give me a break. You've got the wrong categories. 
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton You know God exists but you habitually suppress that truth because you like your unrighteousness. God's existence isn't up for debate. God is axiomatic. 
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton God defines sin. God defines homosexual activity as a tier one level sin, i.e., an abomination. People engaging in that need to repent for all their sins and get right with God. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton God's standards repel you. God hating secularists at war with God's standards draw you in like a moth to a flame. You and I are on different teams. You're #PlayingChurch if you even do that every now and then. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton But you don't do that too! Here's the distinction: You base you limitations on whatever is the fad among the crypto-Marxists and I set the limits based on God's standards. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Again. 1. You say something heretical based on external secular sources hostile to God. 2. I point it out. 3. You change the subject. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I agree there a lot of traditions and flavors and styles that can all be filed under historic Christianity. They are brothers and sisters. I don't think anyone has a perfect theology in this life. However, there are basic standards that seem allergic to you. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton WOW! Do you have any more atheist Marxists with an axe to grind against God to tell me about theology? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton LOL those are the bell bottoms that keep coming back whenever people don't like the law. German atheists thinking German atheist thoughts and writing them down. It's entirely speculative. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton That's not how it looks to me. You're just some fad jumper hopping on the latest atheistic progressive ad campaign. You like their trendy movement and you toss out God to be seen as hip to it. It's capitulation. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton So you equate supporting some completely unscriptural social practices with opposition to some completely unscriptural social movements. This isn't about petty political movements. In the US we have the choice of a party of atheistic Marxians or atheistic Ayn Randians 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I did not realize that, because it is entirely unfounded speculation on your part. I don't see the need to boast of my Kingdom activities. I live in pretty poor area of the city. There's a lot of work being done and more needs to be done, but that's not the issue under discussion 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Says who? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I don't think it bodes well for the imposters pretending to be Christians but are actually promoting abominations. In the past, they would say "I got a revelation from an angel!" but now they say "I got a revelation from pagan social scientists!" It's all in the open. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm talking about the composition. I am not talking about snapping a finger into utopia. I am a postmillenial so I believe Jesus will put his enemies under his feet, including the imposters promoting lawlessness as Godliness ;) 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Dude, you are so impressionable. You hop on what are equivalents of intellectual bell bottoms, little mind fads, the latest idea fashions every blog and magazine is talking about. Whatever you think you hold on to today could be one campaign away from horrific to you the next day 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton You operate under the same presuppositions as the scholars. You eat up their material because you see it as a neutral worldview when it is in fact heavily invested with presuppositions about the impossibility of a Sovereign God. You seem very easily swayed by all the wrong types. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton If you reject what I've said, then there is no way the Mosaic literature could predate the Babylonian period, because how could Moses have known or guessed correctly about future events? It's impossible in world that is assumed to be without a Sovereign God. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton This means that prophecy is not post facto pretending to be before the fact, nor is prophecy just a lucky guess/coincidence. Prophecy is a direct sign from a Sovereign God of the universe of His authority. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Here's where I'm coming from: God is sovereign over the structure of the universe and diachronic history. Since God is triune, He is able to do something more than lecture from up high down to a stenographer. The Spirit of God can indwell in a writer and guide them perfectly 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton You want to be loved by the pagans. It won't happen. It's just capitulation :( 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Your (3) would be a subset of (2). It's atheist hermeneutics 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It wouldn't lend credibility to my claim ACCORDING to you, because you've already rejected the most basic presuppositions of Christianity. You're wandering without a tether being tossed around by new studies from our haters. They've done a bang up job with you. You've capitulated 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton You don't get it? Since Moses predicted the Babylonian captivity, we'd have have to either (1.) assume that either God exists and knows the future or (2.) reject God and insist that they are forgeries written after the events took place to appear prophetic. Which sounds godless? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Why not just apostatize instead of continuing what appears to be a charade? 
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Agree. 
Agree. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton What's your deal then? Why do you even bother identifying yourself with something that you obviously see as nothing more than a Rorschach Test with no real there to be found other than our own narcissistic desires? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Ah so the text is simply a reflection of ourselves. Death of the Author. Death of God. Solid depravity! 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Is there no limit to your capitulation? That's the theory of the radical godless skeptics, and they do so on the basis that prophecy would require the supernatural, and since the supernatural doesn't exist, the text must have been written after the events of the prophecy. 
@JohnC64 @omeagoz @absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton If you thought I implied it, then I am voicing my objection to your interpretation 
@omeagoz @absalomedia @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton If every panda embraced their natural and normal self as you see it, then there would be no more pandas. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Much more than that. His view of scripture was mountains higher than the position you've laid out for yourself. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton So it is your position that scripture is just a collection of people philosophizing about their conception of God and divine inspiration doesn't exist by way of the Holy Spirit? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton If they are wired for that, why did Moses persecute them so hard? Obviously God wouldn't tell him to call them abominations and call for their death, so obviously Moses must have been hearing voices in his head. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I don't think you understand what I mean about God's timeless law. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Jesus thought of the scripture as inerrant, but that was silly right? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Where's the line? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton And therefore that means what? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Ohh so God's law evolves along with the atheist morality and knowledge and it is just an illusion that you've completely capitulated to the godless culture? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton No doubt they haven't shown that! But what if they did? You've capitulated to them thus far, where's the line? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton So your point is what exactly? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton LOL you are too much! You're twisting my words. I'm trying to keep this PG dude 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton What on earth are you talking about? It was a simple question and you responded with something completely out of left field to change the subject. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Suicides is a sin. People who are the biggest rebels against God are more likely to commit it. It's not a coincidence. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It'll be a great day! However while I on earth the order is to be fruitful and multiply in the way God designed us. That's location of sex within that proper, covenantal institution. It's not about loving pleasure. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton That just avoided my question. I'll ask again: Can anti-Christian scientists hide behind their degrees and legitimately overthrow God's timeless law? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I didn't say that. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Men are born sinful. You don't think Jesus had a problem with sinfulness? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Jesus gave the law to Moses 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Ohh so pagan medicine can overthrow God's timeless law? Is that how things work? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It is in the NT. Jesus' resurrection didn't abolish chromosome configurations of male and female. It did not abolish gender roles in society. It didn't allow one to will oneself out of the God given body. Nothing changes. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "But wait! The people who are trans don't like the law saying that! They don't like it in the NT! They say it is unloving! They say it is denying their humanity! They say it causes suicide! Can't we rewrite the Law of God so we aren't bigots?" 
 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Being trans is forbidden by the Law of God established in the Torah and continued into the New Covenant. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton If you mean a hermaphrodite, nobody thinks that's sinful. 
 
Trans is another example of rebelling against God's natural order. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton You misunderstand me. I don't lay with my wife when she's menstruating. That's weird. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Do I believe God's standards clearly prohibit sin? YES. EMPHATICALLY YES. A THOUSAND TIMES YES. "Wait wait wait, but does that apply if the person who sins will likely feel unhappy about it being called a sin, and maybe even suicidal?" Nothing changes. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton What are you talking about? “You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness while she is in her menstrual uncleanness." You act like this is some weird command. Is this really a thing people do? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Absolutely 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm showing you Paul's hermeneutics. He looked at Lev 18 and he looked at what was going on in Corinth and he put a stop to it even though the congregation thought it all love and a blessing. They have the same problem as you, apparently. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton ... but what about the love? What about the stability? What's wrong with that? Paul isn't with you. Nobody in scripture is with you. You are with the world and you want their love. Good luck with that. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father's wife. And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you." 1 Cor 5... 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Do I need to give a proof text barrage about transgenderism? Surely you know what the whole council of God bears witness to, right? 
 
It sounds like your questioning God's wisdom and challenging His Law. 
 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton They did not need to spell out to the people that unlawful sexual relations that were called abominations can never be proper expressions of holy love. It was axiomatic. It was common sense. It went without saying. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Here's what I've done: 
 
1. I shown the law that spells it out in unambiguous terms, i.e., no exceptions. 
2. I showed the continuation of the law into the New Covenant. 
3. I showed that proper love is not lawless, but in conformity to God's timeless law. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Are you messing with me? Have you not read that He Who made them in the first place made them man and woman?  It says, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will live with his wife. The two will become one.’  So they are no longer two but one. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton The saints believed that what you call love is an abomination. You are just scared of the pagans thinking you're backwards idiot who believes in the sky daddy. It seems you are super keen on getting their approval. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton They don't have magisterial power and they'll be judged for acting outside of their position, but that doesn't make one the good guy and the other a bad guy. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton That's what makes the claim of bandwagon accusation so amazing. It's a "bandwagon" that has gone untouched for over a millennium. You're jumping on the fad because you are afraid to stand for God's word. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm applying your logic consistently, and you just laugh dismissively without explanation. Here's the thing: you only want to apply that methodology to one thing because you are afraid of the pagan culture calling you a bigot according to their standards. It's moral cowardliness. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton But they loved money and all love is from God and if you love money it must be because it's an expression of the image of God, right? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton What part of "I am the Lord. You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination" do you not understand? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. (Rev 22) 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good." (Romans 12) 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you." (John 15) 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "For they [Pharisees ] loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God." (John 12) 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life." (John 12) 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil." (John 3) 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me." (Matt 10) 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton An overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. ... With all dignity keeping his children submissive (1 Tim 3) 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed him. And he said to them, “You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God. (Luke 16) 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Now therefore hear this, you lover of pleasures, 
who sit securely, 
who say in your heart, 
“I am, and there is no one besides me" 
... 
But evil shall come upon you, 
which you will not know how to charm away (Isaiah 47) 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money... disobedient to their parents... unholy ... without self-control... not loving good, treacherous, reckless... lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power." 2 Tim 3 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Scripture is not silent on proper vs. improper love. It's in the law. I love my mother. Can I love my mother improperly? Yes. I love my best friend. Does that mean anything goes? No. I love my neighbor and his wife. Do I get to define how I show my love for his wife? No. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Okay, now were are getting somewhere. The one who lusts doesn't get to redefine it as love. The distinction lies in God's Law, not man's twisted brain, which is able to rationalize anything for selfish ends. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I must have lost you. Our ultimate authority is not the confessions or catechisms. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Scripture is special revelation 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I must have lost you somewhere. God defines proper love. God defines the proper expression of proper love. People who reject God also reject God's definition of love and make up their own definition. Their self-made definitions are rejected as sin. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton https://t.co/MDNHzJhXB8 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I am confessionally reformed. I do not have an irrational hatred or phobia of the Roman or Greek Church. Having said that, the sole authority for doctrine and theology is scripture. When a particular early Christian is right, it is right because it is scriptural. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Ohh so you can sprinkle some Jesus on sodomy and that makes it all good? How about any of those other sins? You know that doesn't work. You're being slippery. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton In the Jewish-Christian worldview everything is theological. The act is presented typologically and rhetorically as pure rebellion against God and His created order and this is presented as accompanying other abominations in general sense. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Where's the money??? Where's the abuse??? It's men who bed other men. Stop being slippery. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "For if their laws are righteous, their gods are  unrighteous, since they transgressed the law in killing one another, and practising sorcery, and committing adultery, and in robbing and stealing, and in lying with males, and by their other practises." Apology of Aristides 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I just gave the quote. Where's the money???? It's a list of sins including men who abuse the natural order by bedding other men. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton And that somehow means that it doesn't mean men who bed with other men? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Yes, yes, but like I said they never give the quotes. I just gave the one from Acts of John and it has nothing to do with economics. Your source is deceptive. Where's the quotes? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "Let the murderer know ... punishment is laid up for him twofold after his departure... Likewise also thou poisoner, sorcerer, robber, defrauder, sodomite [arsenokoitai], thief, and as many as are of that band, ye shall come at last... unto unquenchable fire" (Acts of John) 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm open to the possibility that this anti-LGBTI conspiracy exists for thousands of years and everyone was in on it until just recently. 
 
@JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @GeorgeSaadi @vanbadham @LyleShelton "God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men" Rom 1 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Yes. The context is abundantly clear. There's no debate among anyone who isn't a heretic. 
@omeagoz @absalomedia @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Did you skip biology 101? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton But that's not what the word means. If it were, then they'd use the masculine form of prostitute and tie it to the word temple. 
 
Paul was referring to Lev 18, which does not say: men can sleep with men as long as it isn't in the context of idolatry at the pagan temple. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Philo didn't use the same word as Paul, but it was similar 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Of those 77 most clearly mean what Paul means: ancient homosexuals 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton So there was a massive conspiracy to cover up the fact that the word for men who bed other men doesn't actually mean men who bed other men and the people we can trust to translate it to mean something untranslatable tend to all be gay activists? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Paul takes the Septuagint trans of Lev18:22 which mentions men + bed and puts them together to give his word for homosexual a distinctly Lev18 feel. The vast majority of texts clearly refer to homosexuals. Do they all? No. Was it a reflection of Greek hyperbolic polemic? Probably 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Did they stumble upon some new manuscripts? Why the change? It's simple: they are selling out to popular pagan culture and they are tired of being accused of bigotry and since they don't care for scripture much anyhow, they shipped the Bible to the chopping block. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton What is proper theology to an agnostic? That was a rhetorical question. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Unless you have any other questions, comments, or concerns, I think that pretty much wraps it up. You're agnostic and I know where you stand. You should know where I stand. It has been a pleasure conversing. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton And these things aren't up for review by sinful man every generation or so. God is at the head of proper theology, not sinful man, and where He has spoken the issue is closed. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "Love" in English encompasses four Greek words: Agape, phileo, storge, and eros. Agape is the deep love the scripture deals with most. Confusing the other forms with agape leads to confusion. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton This is twitter. It would help if you were more specific so I don't waste your time answering something you're not asking. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Pagans love their idols. God doesn't view that love to be legit. Some people love money. God doesn't view that love legit. Some people will murder and steal for love. God doesn't view that as legit. Let's not turn love into another empty word. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton It's not from my own imagination saying "I like this, but not that." It comes from scripture. Dietary laws were declared over. The sacrificial system was declared over. Jewish exceptionalism was declared over. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton There is a simple interpretive method. I can't flesh it out in a tweet, but if you seriously have questions why somethings are practiced and others aren't, I'd be happy to give an answer. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton And the LORD says: "And you shall not lie with any animal and so make yourself unclean with it, neither shall any woman give herself to an animal to lie with it: it is perversion." Is this still relevant today? What if science finds out that the animals like it? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Adam didn't have the law. We're talking about the revelation of God's law in history regarding incest. What's the big deal? Love knows no bounds right? 
Is this how we do? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I mean things change, right? Moses had no idea that such a loving relationship could exist, but we know better today that it is theoretically possible that this could become obsolete. The Lord spoke to them, not us, right? 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm talking about rebellion within the parameters of a Supreme Being who has entered into history and has spoken. If you reject that premise, nothing I am saying should make sense, because then it all becomes subjective and up to a vote by sinful man. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton You act as if "science" is some neutral ground where everyone agrees on this issue and we should just take our theological orders from what? The best selling authors? A poll of leading scientists? Should we update our confession every 10 years after a survey? God has spoken. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton We're talking about jurisdiction. They can rebel all they want. There are consequences. 
@absalomedia @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton The meaning is derived from context. Paul wouldn't have thrown an innocent rape victim out of the Kingdom of God. His use demands cooperation on both parties involved (active/passive). There's no way around. Matthew Vines et al can try but it's bordering on the absurd 
@omeagoz @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Get an ESV. It's a great translation. https://t.co/F3iNu7xTIF 
@JohnC64 @TummyJimmy @GeorgeSaadi @vanbadham @LyleShelton "Love thy neighbor" is a summery of the law given to Moses, which included executing sodomites 
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Okay, we stone them and they die. We don't stone them and they kill themselves. We leave them alone and they die from alarming rates at early ages from drug overdose and STDs. I wonder what's up with that. 
@TummyJimmy @JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @vanbadham @LyleShelton I have a beautiful beard! 
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Jude, i.e., Jesus' brother who grew up with Jesus says: "just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire." 
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Do murderers hang themselves in prison because of society being so mean to them? Are we supposed to feel bad? 
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Harm society? That lifestyle is death to begin with. Why are you surprised by the statistics? 
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton I'm not one of those cherry picking Christians. It says what it says and there is no way around it. 
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton "I am the Lord. You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. And you shall not lie with any animal and so make yourself unclean with it, neither shall any woman give herself to an animal to lie with it: it is perversion." (Lev 18) 
@JohnC64 @GeorgeSaadi @TummyJimmy @vanbadham @LyleShelton Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. (1 Cor 6) 
@alrightPET @tonyschwartz Absolutely! 
@sumbodysbabygrl @tonyschwartz "If there is a betrothed virgin, and a man meets her in the city and lies with her, then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry for help though she was in the city" (Deut 22) 
@TummyJimmy @GeorgeSaadi @JohnC64 @vanbadham @LyleShelton "Judge not!" is the most misquoted verses in scripture. We are commanded to judge righteously rather than hypocritically. 'I charged your judges at that time, ‘Hear the cases between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the alien who is with him.'
