Madrid, even without Ronaldo, has a different mentality at UCL. As long as they turn on the UCL passion, it's still very dangerous. It takes time indeed this is Juve. But who knows? 
Cristiano aja ga akan cukup. He has started. Yes. He won't stop.  But the other guys need to have a bigger hunger. Like Madrid. Masalah mentalitas. 
Luckily Max has Ronaldo on his team. After losing this, surely he will start to be more fierce asking for the supply of ball wkwkkwkwk. This transmission to the first team later. 
Allegri has been playing right. It's just a waste of opportunity. 
United use what they have. 
Subs United is more effective. 
 
Mandzu is late in, Barza as a RB is awesome. Want the right subs, Juve. 
Madrid 15/16 is an example that momentum can take you to victory. 
 
16/17 Upgrade. Especially in K.O stage. Get off the chance at GS. Ruthless. 
It must be upset that J7ve's players hahahaha. 
UCL does need to be fierce, it doesn't matter, don't waste opportunities. Especially against the equivalent team. 
Jupe disease 
Enter BarzGli, actually Max's response because Fellaini's eyes entered. United must be aiming for an aerial threat and a set piece situation.

@BlancoStats @muddassirjourno I know. But Madrid won't break bank to find Kova replacement. 
@muddassirjourno @BlancoStats We already had Ceballos and Llorente. I think Madrid won't bid for anybody to replace him. Even if James comes back, it won't end the rotation drama. 
It would be a shame if he leaves cause we know how good Mateo is. 
But, we often forget we have Ceballos and Llorente. 
 
For Mbappe, it's different because he could play as a center forward and i think he's more lethal in 442.

To make it simple. 
Don Di Stefano had a greater Achievement than Cristiano did. 
 
It's hard to be objective 
You can't bring all the records that Cristiano broke and All the goals he scored to conclude that He is a Greater player than Di Stefano was. 
 
You need a deep research. 
The player's attribute. 
The team mates. 
 
Many more 
It's okay If you decide to say Di Stefano is a Greater Madrid's player than Cristiano just because of the Club's achievement when he was there. But that's not a correct method.

It's not a wordplay, boy. 
 
Di Stefano know he's worth. The only Super Ballon D'Or holder said that and that's enough for me. 
 
Plus, if you comparing the Competition back then and Now it is not an apple to apple comparison. 
Both of 'em make a Huge impact for the club. 
As far as i know, Di Stefano himself said Cristiano is much better than him. 
That's enough for me

Here's why. Diego Costa isn't really good with link up play. And you put him alone at the front. 
 
Rodrigo should've come earlier. 
Daniel Carvajal needs to come in too. Spain was too left sided on attack. 
Rodrigo Iago or Iniesta would change this game completely. Costa need a company in the box. 
Now Asensio is on. His time to shine like Mbappe. 
@pangeransiahaan @benfisherj For the mentality and defensive wise, Uruguay and Croatia are the best among others.

France Brazil Croatia hopefully will be in the semis. 
Now i am rooting for Croatia and Hope Kylian Mbappe will be the Player of the tournament. 
Joao Moutinho would have been a better choice than Adrien Silva. 
 
Andre Silva too. Instead of Guedes. Why? Because with Godin and Jimenez in front of you, you need a diversion. And hoping for the best with crosses like that was like Hoping not to get wet when you swim. 
And Cedric. Why Santos? Just Why?! 
Portugal is a limited team but they want to play. Try to win with their limited capability. 
 
Uruguay in this campaign will play just like this. This the only way Tabarez know. 
Bernardo Silva will lead the next generation of Portugal. He did everything. He was everywhere. Shame that Santos realized his capability too much late.

@muddassirjourno @Cristiano No easy route in World Cup. Specially this edition. Hopefully, Portugal vs Spain for the final. 
No African Team qualified. Tough luck. Senegal deserved it tho. 
@SAMBIT_MANNA 1st, vulnerability not just about defense. Your point abt attacking power, it includes in my point bro. If you are strong enough to break the barrier, you'll score. That is the mechanism. 
(Beside the human error). 
 
This is the Golden Rule of the highest level of futbol. 
@SAMBIT_MANNA They won because their opponents are more vulnerable than 'em + pattern of convertion + effectiveness. 
 
@SAMBIT_MANNA The less vulnerable you are, the better chance to win. 
@SAMBIT_MANNA Still for me, with Costa only upfront, we won't see the Best version of Spain. 
@SAMBIT_MANNA Still they are slow as fuck when defend. Even vs IRAN. 
With minimum possesion the system get the best outta Brozo Luka Ivan. Plus Sebic Perisic is a workhorses. 
@SAMBIT_MANNA They really could improve if they play with Firmino from the start. Too bad Douglas is injured, he would be more useful than Willian. 
 
In the final third, Neymar held the ball too much. That's the only probs. 
@SAMBIT_MANNA Solid Defense start in the Middle of the Field. Not from the back. You get me wrong again. 
 
You just can't rely every attacking task to Isco-Silva-Iniesta. 
@SAMBIT_MANNA That's why Zizou left bro. We can't deny that. 
 
And in 17/18 look how we played. Similar system in the paper BUT a very different one with 16/17. 
If only Spain players are more lethal at the front, your argument will be right. 
@SAMBIT_MANNA Still they had the best system so far. 
Right now, whenever Brazil-France hit the Top Gear, they will thrive. 
@FootbaIIogy Portugal vs Spain for the Final. 
@SAMBIT_MANNA If you have the best system, you just don't concede that 'easily'. 
 
Uruguay haven't tested yet with great attacking team. 
Let's see Belgium tomorrow. 
@SAMBIT_MANNA Croatia had the best system so far. Not Spain. 
@SAMBIT_MANNA That's why i said you have to start with Solid Defense.

@FootbaIIogy Just leave it man. It's their time to be in Euphoria. We have something to do. To cheer our GOAT is more important. 
So far Beside the result, based on the Display, only Croatia, Spain, Germany, Uruguay, Mexico, Belgium, France are convincing.

#VivaRonaldo 
#ConquestGOonho 
@kun6manuk But for me Morocco was the bigger upset. The first game own goal crushed their hope. 
For me, Iran was lucky to have a goal (i don't count the OG) But their Def job was immense. 
@kun6manuk vs Croatia, They had so many great chances. Would be a crazier scene if they made it. But this is Futbol. 
 
Until now, almost all of the nations surprised us. 
Big Nations shithousery, One man team exits, VAR controversies, 2nd-3rd tier teams gone mad. 
♡ this game, man. The best. 
@kun6manuk The toughest group so far are Group B and Group H (look at the margin). 
 
The easiest one are Group A and the Belgium's group. 
 
In the Germany's group, it was a big surprise they are not easily qualified. 
 
But in the end we have to agree that this time every match are tougher. 
Back in the qualification they topped their group and forced Croatia to the play off. 
 
Nigeria had the youngest squad in this tourno. 
 
Argentina already worst since the qualification. 
 
Croatia really learn to win pragmatic. 
@kun6manuk Play Godin and Pepe. That's all you have to do. 
I don't play the game. But i think Portugal will win with a goal margin (the bigger the better for me) lol 
@kun6manuk First of all, Brazil are not in a weaker group. 
Switzerland and Serbia are a settle team. 
Switzerland was a huge paint in the ass since Hitzfield and those Serbians are butchers that ready to kill Joho Bonito. 
Germany's struggle is a surprise. 
France was never convincing tbh. 
The first wish is hopefully Uruguay vs Portugal won't be a boring match. 
 
 
What about Cristiano? 
I know. He will show up.

This Portugal and Uruguay have a similar characteristic in their group. 
The differences are Uruguay have 2 World Class Forwards and a great backup forwards in Suarez, Cavani and Stuani. 
Godin-Jimenez partnership too are better than Pepe-Fonte. 
 
The MFs of both team are the same 
Effectiveness is a key. 
Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic have so much to share for the rest of their player. 
No surprise. 
Argentina defenders will have a nightmare for facing Mbappe, Griezmann and Giroud. 
Deschamps is not a great coach. But he is not that bad. People already forgot that He won vs Germany back in Last Euro Semis 
Stop hyping this and that. This is Futbol. Nobody will give you a gift in World Cup. 
 
We have 2 matches already for the 16th and that's awesome. 
We have 2 big matches already! 
 
The first real test for Uruguay and France. 
They haven't met big teams in their group. 
 
Portugal already faced Spain and Argentina faced Croatia. 
The odds would say Uruguay vs France for the quarter. 
Euro16 final rematch for the quarter.

Argentina vs Nigeria will be a deathmatch. 
 
NIG had 0 GD with 3 points 
CRO had 5 GD with 6 points 
ARG will qualify if they win and ICE not win against CRO. 
Or, if they both Win &amp; ARG had a better GD. 
 
Croatia is 90% a group winner. They have 5 GD. Now only Nigeria had a slight chance to top the group but its so unlikely to do that vs ARG 
It looks like Iceland couldn't handle team with no White guys. 
Roberto Firmino and Douglas Costa are the better options against Serbia. 
@yakiirea That is their biggest strength. Just like New Zealand 2014. 
They were good enough to beat Croatia and England.

Not sharp in front.

Mesut Özil needs more courageous maneuvering in the future. 
Germany needs to be more insistent when defending. 
Need to move faster when attacking. Pressing Mexico from the ignorance has never been. 
There is absolutely no Leroy Sane. Draxler doesn't do penetration into the penalty box from the left. Kimmich and Müeller who are active on the right side are crossing. But, Timo Werner is not good at post playing. Useless.

@deroswunga Setubuh. Adam is prepared on IW2 and GoTG3. 
From what the MCU has appeared, only Stark's 'vision of death' and BP's 'afterlife scene' are possible. It's easy not both. 
 
But, 
 
Let's settle this. Soul stone is on Ki Joko Bodo's finger. 
Ki Joko Bodo &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Avengers 
:( 
@deroswunga or also. In the comic, Adam Warlock who sings Soul Stone. There must be an intention at GoTG 2 to recognize his birth to the audience (possibly on IW part 2 appears). 
 
If I see the MCU I want to make the climax of this Arc in the Stark's hand, it could be ...... ah it's still annoyed with civil war 
@deroswunga Eng ing the main war later in the scene where Tony cries uwuwuw kek in the trailer huh. Orange rada2. 
@deroswunga Wajar is the venue for the war on Wakanda, the problem is that only the T'Challa has troops. 
Plus, it's true that the Soul Stone is on Wakanda (this is probably the theory of birth since the meteor fell on Wakanda). 
 
The portal that Parker saw was just a shortcut for visiting Vision. 
@deroswunga @haloyara No. Not Wakanda, del. But a "planet". Rich in the beginning of the trailer (planet to orange).

Gohan even said that he will reach the transformation that no one ever seen. But? Why the fuck they make Gohan sacrifice himself for fucking Dyspo?! 
Fucking imbecile 
Watching the fallen of Gohan in Resurection F and the coming of Beerus is hurt me really bad. I have a hope after Gohan reach his best form (mystique) in really short time before the tournament of power. He match SSB Goku. Lose with SSB Kaio Ken Goku. 
In the end Goku beat Buu after he took senzu's bean and collect the Genki Dama (fuck). The same formula that repeated in GT's final saga. After all the heroes get beaten one by one by the main villain 
@cinematicorgasm In the Marvel Universe T'Challa is the second smartest hero. Only behind Reed Richards. Even Stark is behind him. 
 
Pity that T'Challa's character development is so short. 
But again, Mystique Gohan made a really silly bloopers and it means Goku will take the part. The fuck right?! 
Gohan is the strongest fighter even stronger than SSJ3 Goku but Goku save Satan and his dog and Vegeta and fat Buu. Fuck off 
Vegeta never beat the main villain in any DB Saga. 
Goku never beat Vegeta. 
Ozaru's Gohan and fuckin Yajirobe beat Vegeta. 
Goku beat Frieza. 
Android 17 and 18 beat the shit outta Z fighters until Cell absorb them. 
Gohan beat Cell. 
Buu? It supposed to be Gohan 
I don't know what is wrong with Toriyama. 
In the end of GT, Goku will be the God. It means he is the strongest. Even beat Omega Shenron too with Genki dama. 
 
Vegeta and Gohan deserved the new transformation. And that White transformation is really fit with Gohan's profile

#3billboards shows us every relate recent issues as a sarcasm. Racism,Feminism,Toxic Relationship,Rape Culture and many things. 
This one is absolutely favourite for the Golden Globe and Oscar best picture. 
I mean, it shows you the relationship of a tough Mom with a such strong character (slightly like Metcalf in LB) with her rebelious teenage daughter in a Southern background. His husband is abusive alcoholic that sleep with underage girl too. 
Woody Harrelson and Peter Dinklage, damn! So funny. 
 
#3billboards has every emotion in it. Anger, Disturbed, Funny, Silliness, Desperation and to mixing it well is a hard job. But they did it! 
 
And the family drama, for me it IS better than Lady Bird. 
This one is my favourite Mcdormand performance. Ofc along with Fargo. She is such a more real heroine every family needs. Better than Wonder Woman? Hell yeah! 
 
Sam Rockwell did a really great job, too. Better than his form in TAOJJ.

The fact is that women are very often objectified victims, not yet having sexual abuse. Man too. Ya are both defended. The mindset is first. It's the same as not denying 
Another word: 
This paspampres is over and it's been dismissed 'hey handsome!'. 
If the story of 'handsome remarks' yesterday the context was totally different. 
Female netizens didn't immediately say it to the Prince Daniel. 
 
Like commenting and giving an assessment. The other word belio is considered because it is 'one-on-one'. That's not right. 
Even though the girl / guy who is in the catcall doesn't have a problem in the catcall, even likes it, the third party will still see it as sexual harrassment. 
So don't use the argument "the catcall just likes it in the catcall". 
How do you know that? 
It needs to be realized in Indonesian society, women are 'forced' to be under men with their Patriarchy. 
Not fair. Naturally women are angry and demand equality. 
Differentiate first which is 'Praising' and which is 'teasing'. 
It's magical if there are people who "praise" randomly on the road to people who aren't known.

Barter services for singer-actor-actress models to quickly rise with Producers / Directors etc. are a kind of unwritten norm. I'm so sad. 
Sexual harassment in Hollywood can be overwhelming because it involves big names, but it is actually an open secret in the entertainment world. Let alone at U.S in Indonesia
